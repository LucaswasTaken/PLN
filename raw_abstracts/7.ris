AB  - Abstract This paper shares Saudi Aramco's operational experience and challenges with downhole sweet and sour corrosion and scaling tendencies in the carbon steel (CS) completions. It also reports the company's approach to deal with these issues. Corrosion in wells drilled in sour gas bearing reservoirs commonly occurs in conjunction with iron sulfide scale deposits in the lowermost section of the production tubing and liner. Historically, the progression of sour corrosion has been relatively slow, so CS completions are cost-effective as the frequency of required workovers is low. Nevertheless, although scale deposits are not confirmed to curtail well productivity they reduce wellbore accessibility, which sometimes necessitates their removal by rig-less mechanical operation. Scale removal from old completions resulted in failure of the tubular integrity. In most sour gas wells corrosion starts posing scaling and obstruction problems inside the tubing far before any leaking risk. It is worth noting that this experience is consistent with field cases experienced by Total or other operators, as recently reported in the literature. The company experience with sweet gas producers have shown corrosion tendency to occur at shallow depths with no observed scale deposits. Corrosion was in the form of localized spaced scratches in the joints and metal loss in the pin- and box-ends. For these wells, the average life cycle of tubulars exceeds 10 years. The results from this field study might benefit the world gas producers of Saudi Aramco's intensive and diversified experience and of the completion practices that the company has adapted to develop the high temperature gas condensate fields. It is of particular interest to understand why the corrosion observed on these sweet wells is significantly lower than predicted by most carbon dioxide (CO2) corrosion prediction models.

AB  - Abstract Converting data to actionable information through continuous oil production monitoring is a fundamental part of any production optimization strategy. The development of Intelligent Field technology has remarkably contributed to the upgrading of production surveillance framework and provided an extended access to real-time data. This same technology is still in its infancy when it comes to multiphase mass metering and field practicality issues. As for conventional fields where the unavailability of continuous data flow is not considered out of norm, the high uncertainty in oil production rate estimation and allocation is very well expected. The main source of this uncertainty is the reliance on sporadic welltest data and empirical multiphase flow correlations to allocate liquid production rate. Critical and subcritical multiphase flow choke performance is predicted using well-known correlations that are based on specific datasets characterized by a specific field or hydrocarbon type. Case studies where those correlations are matched with different production data and used later to predict the choke performance are present in the literature. Yet, the oil industry is faced with many challenges because of the limited accuracy of those predictions. The complexity of multiphase flow behavior and the irregularities in operational conditions can explain such low capability of those correlations particularly on field data. Artificial intelligence (AI) tools and techniques for so-called artificial neural networks, fuzzy logic and functional networks were employed to develop data-driven oil flow rate computational models for both critical and subcritical flow conditions. These AI models were trained and tested exploiting 595 production rate tests from 31 different wells. The prediction results showed a strong correlation with actual field data and promised a reliable tool/methodology to estimate oil flow rate as a function of operational conditions and choke size. This paper presents an engineering look at the inclusion of AI data-driven models in the production surveillance system to enhance welltest data validation and reduce the uncertainties in production allocation.

AB  - This article, written by Senior Technology Editor Dennis Denney, contains highlights of paper SPE 112500, "A New Method To Characterize Scaling Damage From Pressure Measurements," by T. Carageorgos, M. Marotti, and P. Bredrikovetsky, SPE, North Fluminense State University, prepared for the 2008 SPE International Symposium and Exhibition on Formation Damage Control, Lafayette, Louisiana, 13-15 February. The paper has not been peer reviewed. Productivity-decline prediction is based on mathematical modeling with well-known model coefficients. The sulfate-scaling system contains two governing parameters: the kinetics coefficient, λ, characterizing the velocity of chemical reaction, and the formation damage coefficient, β, showing how the permeability decreases because of salt precipitation. This paper extends previous works with commingled injection of two incompatible waters into the same core with two different ratios of formation water (FW) to seawater (SW). Introduction Barium- and strontium-sulfate scaling is a major problem in waterflood projects with incompatible formation and injected waters. Barium sulfate and resulting scale causes formation damage near the production-well zone. This phenomenon is attributed to precipitation of barium and strontium sulfates from the mixture of both waters and the consequent permeability reduction resulting in loss of well productivity. The chemical incompatibility between the injected SW, which is high in sulfate ions, and the FW, which originally contains high concentrations of barium, calcium, and/or strontium ions, may reduce well productivity, making the waterflood project uneconomical. A reliable model that is capable of predicting such scaling problems would help in planning a waterflood project. It also could aid in selecting an effective scale-prevention technique by predicting scaling tendency, type, and potential severity. A reliable predictive model must use well-known values of the model coefficients. The mathematical model for sulfate scaling contains two phenomenological parameters: λ from the active-mass law of chemical reaction showing how fast the reaction and precipitation occurs, and β reflecting the permeability decrease caused by sulfate-salt deposit. Both coefficients depend on rock-surface mineralogy, pore-space structure, temperature, and brine ionic strength. Therefore, they cannot be calculated theoretically for natural reservoirs and must be deter-mined from laboratory corefloods. Reagent- and deposition-concentration profiles during reactive flows are nonuniform, so the sulfate-damage parameters cannot be calculated directly from laboratory measurements. They must be determined from laboratory coreflood data by use of inverse-problem solutions. The λ can be calculated from break-through concentration in a quasisteady-state coreflood with commingled injection of FW and SW. Then β can be determined from the pressure-drop increase during flooding.

AB  - AbstractDue to the commingled production of reservoir and injected sea waters, the Dunbar Asset has had to face Barium sulphates scaling problems. In 2001, a post analysis was made over the entire past production history. This study was carried out by a team consisting of well productivity engineers, reservoir engineers and a production chemist from both Headquarters and the Affiliate.The analysis was directed at two different objectives:Fulfil an operational need: A water based pre-emptive treatment applied in 1997 on well D02 caused a substantial reduction in well productivity. This adverse effect led to major uncertainty in the planning and design of new treatments. The Affiliate wanted a complete analysis of this problem in order to come up with new procedures.Learn from Dunbar experience for future developments: Would it be possible, through a production history analysis, to look in detail at the scaling phenomena in order to pinpoint facts or identify engineering tools that could be of use in new development projects? And, as a feedback for future similar projects, could we assess what advantages a nano-filtration plant might have offered?Both the scaling process and the treatment impact were analysed. This was made easier by the fact we had available data from six production logging operations on a key well. In terms of modelling, Reveal model was used to assess physico- chemical related behaviours to be further exported into the Reservoir model. The results of this modelling were matched against actual production history.The paper will focus on the impact on well productivity of the scaling process as it was highlighted through the exercise. As a matter of fact, a relative manageable effect was observed after the first layer water breakthrough. The effect is much more severe after the second layer water breakthrough, which can create actual bridges into the tubing and consequently affect drastically the flow and can trap reserves from lowermost layers.As this method allowed playing back the history, it opens tracks for planning and dealing with the perforation strategy. In other words, it places the scaling prevention concern right in the middle of the reservoir engineers' type of expertise.Apart from technical consideration, the paper will also present quick economical issues. All scale related operating costs and production slowdowns have been compiled and weighted against the Capex and operating costs that would have represented a nano-filtration plant installed from the beginning. This consideration on economics is only meant as a reference point should we need to design developments in similar contexts, and still needs to be examined for any given project.IntroductionDunbar is an oil and gas field located in the UK sector of the North Sea.Its two main panels have been developed by water injection, with 9 producers and 4 injectors drilled during the first phase of the development. During that same period, 7 more wells were drilled to produce other panels under natural depletion.The reservoir pressure was initially 560 bars, to be maintained around 400 bar where water has been injected.The oil is very volatile oil (Bo=3v/v)The Injection water is pumped from Alwyn main platformThe maximum WHIP at Dunbar is 270 bar at a maximum rate of 80000 b/d

AB  - Abstract Process fluctuations are often equivalent to lost production as the necessary margins to process constraints need to take into account the fluctuations. Better operation is achieved by reduced process fluctuations so that the average production may be closer to the constraints. This is achieved by automatic process control which also reduces operator load. Wells which produce oil and free gas (coning) from the reservoir are sensitive to changes in operating conditions, and the gas and oil rates drift over time. This is natural because variations in coned free gas generate variations in wellhead pressure. This will in turn affect the production rate and the well drawdown. In manual operation, a common strategy is to operate with an excess of free gas or use artificial gas lift and manipulate the wellhead choke manually. An automatic wellhead choke control solution is developed to reduce fluctuations and increase production rates. The two main elements in the automatic wellhead choke control are: A robust measure of the controlled variable (i.e. the gas flow rate) A robust control strategy Since the gas flow rate is not directly measured, a gas flow rate estimator was developed, with the premise that no hardware modification should be necessary: a) The gas fraction in the well stream is determined from the pressure drop from the bottomhole to the wellhead b) The total multiphase well flow is calculated from either a venturi meter (if available) or the well head choke (based on choke pressure drop, travel, and characteristics) The control strategy is to ensure fast corrections to keep the gas flow rate close to the specified set point, thus enabling a close-to-collapse operation of the established gas cone. The gas flow rate set point is specified to ensure that the well head pressure is sufficiently high, i.e. higher than the pressure downstream the choke. The solution is implemented on several wells at various Statoil operated fields with gas coning into the wells. The solution gives stable well flow rates, and thus enables increased production. The operator workload related to well supervision has also been reduced. The method could also be applied to other that should remain constant, e.g. water cut, water flow, or GOR, as long as the quantity can be estimated (or measured), and will respond to well head choke manipulations. Introduction Processing constraints usually imply production loss due to fluctuations and the need for operational margins to the constraints. Increased production is achieved by stabilizing the process by automatic control and moving the average closer to constraints as illustrated in Fig. 1.

AB  - Summary Controlling and monitoring flow rates at continuous- and cyclic-steam-injection wells are important elements of reservoir-heat management. For nearly 30 years, critical flow chokes have proven to be the most reliable and cost-effective means of controlling steam injection into heavy-oil reservoirs. Flow-control efficiency has been further improved with tapered-bore bean inserts to achieve critical flow, with only 10 to 15% pressure loss across the choke. For the past 10 years, the standard steam-choke assembly has consisted of a 1-in.-outer-diameter (OD) and 6-in.-long bean with a 6° tapered bore inserted inside a 2-in.-OD cage nipple or housing. Larger-diameter cage nipples and bean inserts have been required for steam-injection rates exceeding 500 B/D. More recently, a cost-cutting practice has been employed using shorter tapered beans inserted in standard choke assemblies. This paper presents the results of field tests conducted to evaluate the effectiveness of shorter tapered-bean length for controlling steam-injection rates. Transition from subcritical to critical flow and overall pressure loss for different tapered-bean lengths are presented. A modified Thornhill-Craver flow-rate equation is provided for critical- and subcritical-flow regions. Calculated and measured rates are compared, and their relative uncertainties are assessed.

AB  - ABSTRACT:A well-recognized hierarchy of defects from microheterogeneities on the grain level to a large-scale network of cracks and layering structures creates a challenge for adequate fracture propagation modeling. The core of the problem is the constitutive equation for such a complex system and the formulation of strength and facture toughness criteria. The concept of a representative volume is commonly used in modeling statistically heterogeneous material by an effective homogeneous continuum. The foundation of this concept and its limitations are discussed. The necessity of an additional scaling rule in dealing with properties like strength and facture toughness that exhibit a scale effect is addressed. An example of brittle fracture in a concrete structure, and the determination of a scaling rule for the scale effect in fracture toughness are presented. The fracture of brittle materials like rocks and concrete appears in the form of highly tortuous, stochastic paths. This reflects a complex interaction between a crack and preexisting as well as newly formed micro-defects controlled by chance, and results in a large scatter of all fracture related parameters. A brief exposition of Statistical Fracture Mechanics (SFM) that addresses the statistical aspects of fracture is also presented. SFM is a formalism that combines Fracture Mechanics methods with Probability Theory and serves as the basis for an adequate modeling of brittle fracture. 1. INTRODUCTIONA well-recognized hierarchical heterogeneity of rocks starts from mineralogical variations on sub-millimeter and millimeter scale, extending into block and layer structures on meter scale, and further up to the multi-kilometer heterogeneity of the continental and oceanic crust. Modeling of such a multiscale heterogeneous structure is a challenge for geomechanical engineering in view of the normally very high uncertainty in the geometry of heterogeneities like cracks/faults network and limited information about the geomechanical properties of rocks.

AB  - AbstractBritish Petroleum issued a challenge, in 1993, to its European producing assets, to increase production by 15% while keeping within its agreed capital budget. To compliment new production attention was also focused on increased production efficiency. The resultant production efficiency campaign, based on simple premises. has contributed a 4% real increase in the operations efficiency in BP's North Sea portfolio, without a substantial increase in opex or capex, resulting in a net gain to BP of some 10 mmboe over the last two years.IntroductionThe North Sea has become a mature province even as its production level continues to rise. British Petroleum recognized the aging nature of its portfolio and issued a challenge to its producing assets, in 1993, to increase production by 15% while keeping within its capital and opex forecast. To compliment the work that was focusing on increasing Production Potential, (more reserves, more wells and more production capacity) attention was also focused on Production Efficiency. The production efficiency campaign was coincident with a reorganization into distinct asset teams, which placed a premium both on safe production delivery within, and communication between assets. To benefit the challenge a common language for defining production losses was adopted and modified to be generic enough for all assets to use. The resultant "choke model" has become the tool that has allowed alignment of problem identification and actions, both intra asset and between like assets. Within two years of adopting the model the assets have been able to show marked and near continuous improvement in both their production efficiency and the delivery of hydrocarbons to market.Statement of Theory and DefinItionsProduction Efficiency improvement is built around the simple concept of a pipeline through which the oil flows from reservoir to market. The objective is maintaining the daily flow rate at the maximum possible. This throughput may be plant capacity for plateau producers or the total well potential for mature phase fields. See Figure 1 Generic Choke Model Concept. A series of restrictions or chokes are visualized in this pipeline, that represent the areas of production loss, i.e. Reservoir potential, as measured by well tests, that is not delivered. The resultant losses are those that occur due to: Reservoir Management; Well Availability and Utilization; Topsides Availability and Utilization, (i.e. the efficiency of using the available equipment); and Export system. (A more specific calculation procedure for the chokes, as given to the assets in 1993, is detailed in the appendix.) These are simplified for management reporting as Reservoir, Wells, Plant, and Export chokes. At this level of detail these "chokes" are common to all our assets.The choke model exists on lower levels as seen in Table 2, Expanded Choke Model Example. Items that appear as in parentheses in the table are specific only to the gas business where the concept of loss must be redefined to allow for system substitution, where available. Thus a gas asset suffers only a true loss when it has missed a DCQ target and has not been able to make up its temporary shortfall. In most instances a pure gas asset carries both a sales efficiency, near 100%, and a system or platform efficiency that more accurately describes the state of the operations. Assets that are both significant oil and gas producers, e.g. Bruce, carry two sets of efficiencies, one as a gas producer and one as an oil producer.The chokes may become more numerous depending on the reservoir processes employed by the asset. This is illustrated in Table 1 as one reads down the figure. In a field such as Magnus or Ula the Gross Potential is very dependent on water injection capacity, and a separate choke model can be used to model injection performance on the wells and reservoir potential. Some assets will carry analysis to the six minor chokes shown and all will further analyze down to at least another level e.g. ESP failure, metering. The assets modify/use the lower parts of the model they see as valid for their particular circumstances.P. 299

Flow control efficiency has been further improved with tapered-bore bean inserts to achieve critical flow with only 10% to 15% pressure loss across the choke.

Larger diameter cage nipples and bean inserts have been required for steam injection rates exceeding 500 b/d. More recently, a cost-cutting practice has been employed using shorter tapered-beans inserted in standard choke assemblies. This paper presents the results of field tests conducted to evaluate the effectiveness of shorter tapered-bean length for controlling steam injection rates. Transition from subcritical to critical flow and overall pressure loss for different tapered-bean lengths are presented. A modified Thornhill-Craver flow rate equation is provided for critical and subcritical flow regions. Calculated and measured rates are compared and their relative uncertainties are assessed. Introduction A Thornhill-Craver style choke with removable tapered-bore bean insert, as shown in Fig. 1, is the most commonly used device for controlling flow rate to steamflood injectors and cyclic steam wells. Under critical flow conditions, steam flow rate depends only on upstream pressure, steam quality and the diameter of the bean throat, expressed in 64ths of an inch. While tapered-bore chokes follow the same critical flow principles of straight-bore chokes, steam pressure exiting a tapered-bore bean can be as high as 80% to 85% of the upstream pressure.

AB  - Summary Polymer flooding is a well-known method for enhanced oil recovery (EOR). Synthetic EOR polymers are susceptible to mechanical degradation. Understanding and mitigating mechanical degradation is a key issue for successful polymer flooding. The main concern of this work is mechanical degradation during choking. Offshore, it is necessary to have control over the injection pressure to each well. During traditional waterflooding, this is achieved by choking the fluid stream by choke valves. In choke valves, there will be sudden change in the flow field, strongly indicating that choke valves will cause mechanical degradation of polymers and thereby reduce the EOR potential of the polymer flood. In this study we investigate mechanical degradation of conventional synthetic EOR polymers. The experiments were performed in commercial chokes and pipes with internal diameters (IDs) from 0.127 to 35 mm, lengths from 13.5 mm to 400 m, and flow rates from 0.3×10–3 to 600 dm3/min, covering several magnitudes of Reynolds number, linear velocities, shear rates, and pressure drop. Using friction factors, f, and Reynolds number, Re, we derived a simple and practical expression for a scaling parameter, 𝜏w/𝜂, for degradation of shear thinning polymers in circular tubes at turbulent and laminar flow, where 𝜏w = f/8 𝜌<𝜐>2. At laminar flow, the friction factor is ∝1/Re, resulting in a scaling parameter proportional to the velocity-to-radius ratio, ∝ <𝜐>/R, equal to the shear rate at the wall and practically independent of viscosity. At turbulent flow, the friction factor is ∝ 1/Re𝛽, resulting in a scaling parameter at turbulent flow, which is a function of density and viscosity and valid only for high shear rates where the viscosity of shear thinning polymers approaches a fixed value. During the large-scale test, several methods for mitigating or decreasing degradation as a function of pressure drop were identified: decreasing the pressure with several chokes in series, each below a critical pressure drop; decreasing the pressure over a long distance in a linear pressure reducer (LPR); or by choking concentrated polymer solution.

AB  - Abstract Gullfaks has been in production since 1986 and produces approximately 11 500 Sm3/d oil from three Condeep platforms. The average water cut is approximately 75 to 80% and GOR of approximately 200 Sm3/Sm3. It has been estimated that between 50 to 100 tonnes of sand is produced yearly per platform with approximately 60 to 70% of the wells in active production (around 90) are limited by sand production. The typically well completion is cased hole with selective production through perforated liners. Rock mechanics studies have shown that sand will be produced irrespective of well inclination and perforation design. On Gullfaks, the sand management strategy used has been to produce wells at "maximum?? or "acceptable?? sand rates. This strategy has led to significant gains in production although there are challenges with this approach that include choke erosion, sand removal from the separators and oil in water quality associated with discharge to sea. In response to this, Statoil have investigated different methods of retaining sand downhole by chemical sand consolidation, of which in situ calcium carbonate precipitation will form the basis for the paper. This technology involves squeezing into the near wellbore predefined concentrations of urea and calcium nitrate along with the enzyme urease. After application, the well is shut in during which the enzyme catalyses the decomposition of urea to bicarbonate that reacts with calcium to form calcium carbonate. The paper will provide details of the laboratory evaluation and, in particular, focus on the field results from the first ever application of this type. A low risk candidate well was selected that had a short perforated interval (19 m) and produced 88 Sm3/d oil with a water cut of 94 %. Results will be presented of the operation design and planning, logistics examination, thorough risk evaluation, and post-operation results with lessons learned. Introduction Gullfaks, operated by Statoil, is located approximately 180 kms north west of Bergen on the Norwegian continental shelf. It consists of three concrete based Condeep platforms. Gullfaks A and C are almost identical and are fully integrated platforms located in water depths of 135 and 217 m, respectively. Gullfaks B is an accommodation, drilling and water injection platform in 145 m of water. The platforms started production of oil and gas between 1986 and 1989 with a record daily oil production of approximately 96 000 Sm3/d achieved on 7th October 1994. Gullfaks is now a mature field and several measures have been put in place to increase the recovery factor from 59 to 62 % and thereby extend the potential field lifetime. Such measures include more use of horizontal and extended reach wells, new completion strategies, alternating water and gas injection and sand control. With regards to the latter, production on Gullfaks is characterised by large volumes of water and increasing sanding tendencies. For a number of years, Gullfaks has followed a sand management strategy whereby sand produced with the wellstreams has been handled topside prior to on-site disposal (Andrews et al., 2005). By choosing to permit sand production to the surface, Gullfaks has had production benefits and avoided expensive sand control completions during infill drilling operations. Typically, wells are choked back to a maximum sand free rate (MSFR) or a maximum acceptable sand rate (MASR). Production of sand creates disposal issues and several integrity challenges.

AB  - Middle East Special Section For nearly a decade, Saudi Aramco has been studying how altering the chemical makeup of seawater injected into its reservoirs can increase production. The result is an increasingly complex view of the interactions caused by the makeup of seawater that explains why seawater does more than just add pressure and help sweep the remaining oil out of a reservoir. The goal is to cost-effectively maximize production by altering the chemistry of seawater. Hundreds of technical papers have been written on the potential benefits of reducing the salinity in seawater injected into formations. More recently there has been a growing body of work on how other ingredients found in seawater—particularly sulfate, calcium, and magnesium—can add to oil output by freeing oil from reservoir rock. Saudi Aramco has focused its research, dating back to 2008, on how seawater is able to increase production from carbonate reservoirs. Two recent technical papers from Saudi Aramco show that it has begun considering how it might modify its water treatment system to turn seawater into “smart water” (SPE 179564), and also offers an update on laboratory studies investigating how the active ingredients in seawater affect oil production (SPE 179590). What is clear from those papers and other sources is that seawater, which Saudi Aramco turned to as a cheap option to scarce fresh water, can enhance the amount of oil ultimately recovered from the ground. The research also suggests that it can make seawater more effective by altering its chemical makeup, turning it into smart water. But this option is neither simple nor cheap. Reducing the salinity of the extremely salty seawater used by Saudi Aramco would require desalination on a massive scale. Further changes to make it smart water add processing steps and may require new technology to reduce the energy required and to overcome the fact that available water treatment methods were not designed to selectively remove ingredients from water. Turning seawater into smart water is a logical next step for the company, which has long been processing seawater on a huge scale to maintain production from its fields. Its Al-Qurayyah Sea Water Plant processes millions of barrels a day of seawater, removing small particles, microorganisms, and oxygen. Now the company has begun considering whether to add further processing steps to apply what it has learned about seawater chemistry by fine-tuning the makeup of the water.

AB  - A gas-lift well sometimes suffers from slugging. As slugs reduce production volumes and cause other issues on the surface, we would like to mitigate or avoid them. The production choke and gas injection choke are two points at which the operator may influence the slug. For this to work, the operator must know that a slug is going to occur in advance so that avoidance actions can be implemented. The operator also needs to know by how much to change each choke. We find that a slug can be forecast successfully five hours in advance given typical field instrumentation of the well. This is based on an LSTM machine learning approach given historical data only.

AB  - Abstract A production choke is essential in regulating the pressure and flow rate of the produced hydrocarbon stream from a well in a field production system. Regulating the pressure and flow rate is necessary to achieve the production objectives of a field, which are to meet customer demand and optimally manage the reservoir over its life cycle. It is therefore important to have a means of effectively monitoring production choke performance to identify the onset of choke wear. Choke wear results from erosion of the choke due to impingement of particles carried in the produced hydrocarbon stream as it passes through the choke body. Choke wear increases the production rate and downstream pressure of a producing well, thereby upsetting the balance of the production system and resulting in ineffective field pressure management. Taking immediate action to replace a worn choke is therefore necessary to restore the production balance and achieve optimal pressure conservation of the production system. Choke performance monitoring is more critical for gas producing wells than oil producing wells because the velocity of gas is typically much higher than the velocity of oil, and consequently the risk and frequency of choke wear is much higher. Physical inspection of the production chokes to confirm wear for offshore gas wells is more laborious and time consuming due to the need to interrupt production, depressurize the flowline, decouple the choke body from the flowline, and ship the choke body onshore to the manufacturer's workshop for component inspections to confirm choke wear and, if necessary, choke replacement. A way to remotely monitor production choke performance and correctly detect choke wear for offshore gas wells without interrupting production is therefore operationally expedient, reduces exposure of personnel to unsafe rough sea conditions, and saves the cost of unnecessary physical choke inspections. The authors present a graphical method of monitoring the production rate and flowing tubing head pressure trends, with the choke size, of offshore high rate dry gas wells to detect choke wear using real-time production data. Examples of successful application of the method, which demonstrates that innovation can be simplification of processes, to detect choke wear and perform timely choke replacement are highlighted.

AB  - AbstractSachdeva's multiphase choke flow model has capabilities of predicting critical-subcritical boundary and liquid and gas flow rates for given upstream and downstream pressures. Although this model was shown to be accurate by Sachdeva et al. in their original paper using laboratory and field data, inaccuracy of the model has been found in other field applications. It is highly desirable for production engineers to find the applicability of this model when it is applied to gas condensate wells. In this study, the accuracy of the Sachdeva's choke model was evaluated using data from oil and gas condensate wells in Southwest Louisiana. Comparisons of the results from the model and field measurements indicate that Sachdeva's choke model generally under-estimates gas and condensate flow rates. Based on measurements from 239 gas condensate wells it was found that the model under-estimates gas rate and liquid rate by as much as 40% and 60%, respectively. The model also failed to calculate mass flow rates for 48 condensate wells where relatively low-pressure differentials at chokes and high-flow rates were observed.The investigation further went on to improve the performance of Sachdeva's choke model. It was found that the error of the model could be minimized using different values of choke discharge coefficient (CD). For gas condensate wells, the error in gas flow rate calculations can be minimized using CD = 1.073. However, the error in liquid flow rate calculations for condensate wells is minimum when CD = 1.532.Introduction Computer technology has been widely used for simulation of petroleum production network today. The production network consists of reservoirs, wellbore equipment, and surface equipment including chokes, flow lines, production manifolds, and distilation facilities such as separators. The production network simulation has gained strong momentum due to fast advances in computing technology in the past five years. Wellhead chokes are special equipment used in energy industry to control fluid production rates from wells, to maintain stable pressure downstream from the choke, and to provide the necessary backpressure to a reservoir to avoid formation damage from excessive drawdown. Because oil and gas production rates are extremely sensitive to choke size, accurate modelling of choke performance is vitally important for petroleum engineers in oil production simulation.

AB  - Abstract Silicate scaling during high pH Alkaline Surfactant Polymer (ASP) flooding is known to adversely affect oil production. The silicate scale occurs as a result of the dissolution of silicates under high pH conditions and where the fluids subsequently flow into a region of lower pH where they then precipitate. The precipitation of magnesium silicate strongly depends on solution pH and temperature and is affected by the kinetics of the silicate scaling reaction. In this paper, the effect of pH on the stoichiometry and morphology of silicate scale is studied. A range of spectroscopic techniques, including Environmental Scanning Electron Microscope/ Energy Dispersive X-Ray Spectroscopy (ESEM/EDX), Fourier Transform Infrared (FTIR) and X-Ray Powder Diffraction (XRD) are applied in order to analyse the precipitated silicate scales in the laboratory. These spectroscopic techniques, when used along with reference sample spectra, yield a number of interpretive clues as to the nature of the silicate precipitates which are formed. The further analysis of the solution and precipitate by Inductively Coupled Plasma-Optical Emission Spectroscopy (ICP-OES) and ESEM/EDX also gave complementary information which was consistent with the results obtained from the other spectral methods above. The approach used in this work has enabled us to establish the composition and morphology of the silicate scales formed under different pH condition. There is relationship between the pH conditions and the compounds appearing in the precipitate. Results obtained can be used to help determine the most appropriate type of scale inhibitor for silicate scale mitigation in future.

AB  - SummaryThis paper describes a multistep pseudofunction-generation process designed to incorporate several scales of process designed to incorporate several scales of heterogeneities into one set of final pseudofunctions to be used in large gridblocks for field simulations. A detailed description of the multistep scale-up process is provided. The calculational procedure and the results of an extensive numerical scaling-up experiment from Kyte and Berry pseudofunctions are described. Three geological descriptions involving pseudofunctions are described. Three geological descriptions involving random permeability variations are used. The effect of three scales (sizes) of heterogeneities on a standard oil/water relative permeability curve is determined from a three-step pseudofunction-generation process. Ranges of mobility ratios, viscosity/gravity ratios, and viscosity/capillary ratios are used in the displacements to provide a guide to the effect of various types and scales of heterogeneities on fluid flow in several regimes.IntroductionPseudorelative permeabilities and capillary pressures have been used Pseudorelative permeabilities and capillary pressures have been used for several years in reservoir simulations to reduce the number of dimensions of the flow field or to reduce the total number of gridblocks (to a computationally economical number). The process allows us to replace the geologically detailed fine grid of rock (laboratory) relative permeability and capillary pressure curves wita few large homogeneous gridblocks containing an effective permeability and pseudofunctions. When the displacement is permeability and pseudofunctions. When the displacement is simulated with the coarse grid of effective permeabilities and the generated pseudofunctions (relative permeability and capillary pressure), the pseudofunctions (relative permeability and capillary pressure), the fluid flow across the coarse-grid boundaries or into the production wells will be the same as in the fine-grid simulation. Thus, the effect of increased numerical dispersion and the decreased detail of the reservoir description in the coarse grid are overcome by the pseudofunctions. pseudofunctions. Recent trends in reservoir-description research have been directed at replacing a fine-grid reservoir containing a specific type of heterogeneity with a very coarse (homogeneous) grid. Davies and Haldorsen replaced stochastic discontinuous shale bodies with pseudorelative permeabilities. Pande et al. studied the pseudorelative permeabilities. Pande et al. studied the replacement of a noncommunicating layered system with a 1D description of the layered system by determining the appropriate pseudofunctions. Both works consider one scale of heterogeneity pseudofunctions. Both works consider one scale of heterogeneity e. g., the discontinuous shales or the noncommunicating layers. Their implicit assumption was that smaller scales of heterogeneities (e.g., variations in the rock permeability between the shales or within the layers) were not important and that the rock curves could be used in the fine gridblocks.Lasseter et al. extended the classic concept for the use of pseudofunctions in heterogeneous reservoir description. The idea water pseudofunctions in heterogeneous reservoir description. The idea water use pseudofunctions in a multistep process to account for several scales of rock heterogeneity and, at the same time, to control numerical dispersion. The process begins with laboratory rock relative permeabilities and capillary pressures at the small scale and permeabilities and capillary pressures at the small scale and ends up, after several steps, with final pseudofunctions for large gridblocks designed for use in field-scale simulations. These final pseudofunctions control numerical dispersion as do the standard pseudofunctions control numerical dispersion as do the standard one-step pseudofunctions, but they also account for the several scales of reservoir heterogeneities. A detailed explanation of the scalingup process follows in a later section.The research project associated with this paper (see Acknowledgment) is meant to expand the work of Lasseter et al. and to provide an understanding of the effect of various scales of heterogeneity provide an understanding of the effect of various scales of heterogeneity in different geological settings on the pseudofunctions. A scaling-up system was defined and displacement calculations were made over a range of mobility ratios, viscosity/capillary ratios, and vis-cosity/gravity ratios for three geological types. A comparison othe results shows the effect of the different heterogeneities on displacements in various fluid-flow regimes. Fluid-flow regimes for each geological description are given where the scaling-up process is not required to give a good approximation of the displacement in the coarse grid.

AB  - Abstract Murphy Montney has been implementing downhole chokes in a variety of successful applications that have resulted in both significantly improved well performance and facility equipment/chemical cost savings.  The specific applications piloted have included: Rate Restriction Mitigating Sand Plugging Surface Hydrate Elimination Liquid Unloading The observed reservoir performance improvement and mitigation of downhole sand plugging is the result of minimizing the net pressure condition created within the induced fracture network.  Restricted well drawdown minimizes the physical loss of the induced stimulation, loss which leads to the downhole plugging situation.   In addition, Montney pressure dependent reservoir responses have demonstrated stimulated reservoir volume (SRV) flow capacity and fracture conductivity improvement/maintenance under higher flowing sandface pressure conditions, significantly enhancing the minimum-contacted-gas-in-place (CGIPmin).  A conceptual reservoir model whereby early pressure maintenance and long-term pressure management is required to maximize the EUR and long-term production has been developed. Downhole chokes are being used in lieu of surface line heaters and methanol injection in the mitigation of surface hydrate formation.  By moving the point of pressure and temperature reduction downhole, the Joule-Thompson cooling response across the choke is geothermally regulated.  Success has also been observed in liquid unloading applications.  Downhole choking can create a choked flow rate Venturi effect, which by definition is based upon a critical upstream to downstream pressure ratio, a function of the gas specific heat relationship.  Choked flow accelerates gas to a sonic velocity across the flow restriction, imparting a sufficient velocity head upon an upstream fluid level to carry a water droplet to surface.  The acceleration of fluid droplets across the downhole choke is equivalent to an infinite lowering of the liquid loading rate, limited only by the maintenance of the choked flow condition created across the downhole choke. The downhole choke permits for a controlled and self-regulated drawdown, creating both improved reservoir performance and well operations.  Mitigating surface hydrate formation and frac sand flowback has resulted in significant cost savings.  A novel application specific to over-pressured reservoirs is the use of downhole chokes in liquid unloading applications, maintaining high flowing sandface pressure conditions while unloading liquid. Introduction The downhole choke pilot program is a field specific evaluation based upon results obtained within both the Tupper and Tupper West fields (Tupper Fields), Figure 1.  The Tupper Fields are a Montney play located in the North Eastern corner of British Columbia.

AB  - UNSOLICITED AbstractIn this study. field data from a gas condensate reservoir located in the Middle East are used to develop some empiricial correlations that describe the behaviour of gas condensate flow through chokes. The data cover wide ranges of flow rates and choke sizes. Four forms of correlation are checked against data. One of the forms is to correlate choke upstream pressure with liquid production rate. gas liquid ratio and choke size. The second form is developed by using gas production rate instead of the liquid rate in the previous form. previous form. The other two forms are developed by using the pressure drop across the choke instead of upstream pressure. These correlations are presented in graphical forms. Five error parameters are used to check presented in graphical forms. Five error parameters are used to check accuracy of the different forms. Namely: root mean square error mean absolute error. simple mean error, mean percentage absolute error and mean percentage error. It was found that the correlation is most accurate when using pressure drop data instead of choke upstream pressure in the correlation. The importance of the developed correlations lies in the fact that correlations for gascondensate systems are not available. Also such correlations will help the production engineer to a great extent in selecting choke sizes to control production of gas-condensate wells and predicting the performance of flowing wells under different conditions. IntroductionThere are two surface conditions under which a flowing well is produced, either using a choke or no restrictions at all. The produced, either using a choke or no restrictions at all. The majority of flowing wells are produced against chokes. The main reasons of using chokes are to control flow rate and thus to produce reservoirs at the most efficient rate and to prevent water and/or gas coning and sand problems. in the critical-flow region, the mass flow rate becomes independent of pressure drop across the chokes. Therefore, chokes are also used to isolate the reservoir from pressure disturbances by surface production facilities. The problem pressure disturbances by surface production facilities. The problem of multiphase flow through chokes has not been satisfactorily solved for all cases. Most solutions are offered only for the case of critical flow. Surbey et al discussed the applications of multiple-orifice valve chokes in critical flow conditions. Wallis developed a correlation to predict the sonic velocity in a two-phase homogeneous system. A different correlation was developed by Fortunati under no-slip condition between different phases.

AB  - The flowback period of the unconventional wells is very critical as it can cause determential ecomonical effects if not properly optimized. The success of the well is as dependent of the completion program as it is from the flowback program applied during the initial production period of the well. If ineffective operations are performed on the flowback phase {independently on the completion technology}, the well can underperform and become unsuitable for development. In unconventional wells, it is necessary to develop the safe well operating envelope in safe zone to prevent the early proppant flowback based on the reservoir parameters and the completions in place. The well can start producing in this developed safe well operating envelope by controlling the wellhead pressure and surface valves and optimizing the proper choke size to keep the well with free proppant production. Proppant flowback production modeling captured decline of water production as well as the increase of liquid production when a selected choke sizes is applied. By controlling the flowing bottomhole pressure (FBHP) during defined flowback period, the volume of proppant production decreased with decreasing chokes sizes and increasing long flowback periods. This study showed that the optimized choke sizes to improve the longer production periods depended on the sensitivity of pressure drawdown, liquid rates, wellhead pressure, and fracture geometry parameters. Numerical results showed that the critical parameters affecting the stability of the proppant pack are fracture closure pressure, reservoir pressure, proppant type and size, and type of fracturing fluid. Proppant flowback program developed by using optimized choke size, wellhead pressure (WHP) and FBHP, and amount of producible proppant volume predicted for designed flowback production periods. At the beginning of the flowback period, the wellbore is filled with fracturing fluid and the minimum choke size should be used as small as possible (12/64"). The controlled FBHP management over 45 days of flowback period corresponds to an average drawdown rate of 10 psi/day to 200 psi/day. Finally, the developed workflow applied to design flowback periods and selection of choke sizes to prevent excessive proppant production and proppant crushing in hydraulically fractured unconventional wells. This paper presents the methodology and workflow for selecting the required choke sizes and flowback periods to minimize the risk of production of high volume proppant during the flowback period after fracturing. The case study presented here in will present the benefits of optimizing choke sizes and flowback programs for reducing the damage to fracture conductivity and to increase the cumulative production. The optimized choke sizes, flowback strategies and workflow established with this case study have proven to increase the performance of fractured unconventional wells.

AB  - Abstract Choke and kill lines used on deep water drilling risers subjected to high pressure are traditionally made of heavy wall steel pipes. By introducing light weight composite choke and kill lines, the submerged weight can be reduced by 50%. Choke and kill lines for deep water and high pressure may contribute up to 50% of the total drilling riser weight. The current development is making 22.6 m (75 ft) long composite choke and kill lines with an internal diameter of 114.3 mm (4.5") and pressure rated to 1034 bar (15000 psi). The lines have a steel liner and steel end connections to make them compatible with standard steel lines. The steel liner is reinforced with carbon fibre/ epoxy structural composite. The lines are designed to meet all relevant load cases both from operation, handling and qualification according to requirements in API and DNV standards. A technology qualification plan has been developed after a threat assessment exercise according to DNV RP-A203. To close the gaps in the technology qualification plan a set of pipe tests (on full diameter pipe) was conducted satisfying the requirements in the relevant design documents, including burst, fatigue and creep tests. The technology qualification plan establish the degree of qualification required for the new technology and comprises all activities needed in order to provide the set of evidences needed to show that the component is fit for purpose, and shall demonstrate confidence that the manufactured C&K - lines meet all performance requirements and hence will function reliably for intended use. To demonstrate the ability to make full length slender components by filament winding, three full 22.6 m (75 ft) lengths of the choke and kill lines were manufactured and have been successfully factory acceptance tested at 1560 bar (22500psi), i.e. 1.5 times the maximum design pressure. One of the unknown factors identified in the threat assessment was potential handling damage. Based on the threat assessment it was decided to have a pilot installation of the technology at the desired technology readiness level. A drilling rig has been selected as the potential site for a pilot, and the pilot is closing all gaps in the technology qualification plan. Introduction Background Hydrocarbon prospects are localized in water depths beyond 3000 m. At present it is a technological challenge to find cost-efficient methods to develop these potential ultra-deep water oil reserves found. Typical ultra-deep water areas are Gulf of Mexico, offshore Brazil, West Africa, East Africa (Kenya, Tanzania, Mozambique), Indonesia and India. Even more challenging is the ultra-deep water areas with harsh environment; these are Canada East Coast, Atlantic Margin and Norwegian Sea. The subsalt (or presalt) reservoirs adds increased complexity of very deep wells (6000-7000 m below the sea bottom), with long casing strings that needs to be deployed in the wells. The casing string weights can also be a challenge to the hook load of the derrick system on the rig. A high pressure reservoir needs a heavier drilling fluid to balance the well pressure, which adds even more to the hook loads. The size of the drilling rig is dependent on the requirements from both drilling riser system and the casing string. For deep water high pressure applications, choke & kill lines contribute to about 50% of the total drilling riser weight. Lighter choke & kill lines may increase the safety level by enabling use of heavier mud during drilling operations in deep water high pressure reservoirs.

AB  - Abstract Angola's O&G business environment has shifted from Exploration to Production, and from Drilling to Well Intervention for obvious reasons of current and projected state of the E&P industry where operations are squeezed by volatile oil prices and higher operating costs. Operators in quest to maintain production plateau resolve in excessive choke increase. Therefore, a focus on predicting resulting HWcut and or HGor over time becomes significant as 75% of fields are under fluid injection for a balance voidage replacement. This study uses fields in Angola for conventional diagnostics decline curve analysis. Using plots of cumulative oil vs GOR, Pressure, Water cut and choke, to analyses the water and or gas production responses vs. oil cumulative to the excessive choke change. To have a complete sense of the impact, PI is included to consider oil production with respect to pressure drawdown. This study where mainly focused in clastic deposits. This approach may help anticipate the production of water due to excessive increase in choke sizes. It is expected that depending on the provenance of the water, it is concluded that excessive choke variation can be problematic in the future. A possible warning or alert is generated for any future choke change and hence oil production is optimized. An excel macro coding- PredOPT (Prediction and Optimization) is developed for the analysis and plugged-in to commercial software for the ease of applicability.

AB  - AbstractSand from reservoirs is carried along with oil and gas in producing wells. This sand can cause severe erosion resulting in failure. A variety of fittings are especially susceptible to erosion damage. For example, geometries that redirect the flow such as elbows experience erosion. In these cases, the particle momentum resulting from the mean flow drives the sand into the wall resulting in erosion. Several researchers have investigated this form of erosion. However, only a few studies have investigated the erosion in chokes where the erosion can even be more severe. In fact, chokes can experience failure due to erosion in a matter of a few days in high pressure gas wells. The present work uses computer simulations to examine the erosion in chokes. The simulation consists of three parts: solve the flow field (velocities, pressure, turbulent kinetic energy), determine sand trajectories, predict erosion resulting from sand impingement information. This paper presents the results obtained during each of these parts for three cases that examine the effect of pressure drop and shape on the severity of erosion. The results obtained from the model are in good agreement with field observations.P. 769

AB  - ABSTRACTAn experimental investigation was performed to determine the relative erosion, abrasion and cavitation resistance characteristics of selected materials. Testing was conducted under controlled laboratory conditions to simulate service conditions encountered in production and injection chokes. The testing effort is ongoing. The data accumulated allow informed material selection of conventional and novel trim for all chokes, valves, flow metering orifices, fixed beans and other devices used during drilling, completion and production of offshore and onshore oil and gas wells. Sintered silicon carbide and tungsten carbide with minimum binder content were the most erosion and abrasion resistant of the materials tested. Cobalt base alloys bar and nickel chrome alloy 625 bar proved to be most cavitation resistant. INTRODUCTIONWear of wellhead chokes and other pressure reducing devices is a serious and common problem. Erosion, abrasion, and' cavitation are three types of wear, which is defined 1 as the volume of material removed. As the choke is adjusted to throttle fluid flow, a series of localized, time dependent and very complex flow fields are established in the region of the throttling point, such as the plug/seat gap in a globe valve. Each flow field is a function of the valve position, fluid phase and properties, pressure drop across the choke and ratio of pressure drop to upstream pressures. Choke trim design parameters, such as trim contours and clearances also greatly affect the flow field. The nature of the flow field in the gas choke is of particular concern when erosion of the trim material is considered. When the ratio of the pressure drop to the upstream pressure becomes critical, the velocity at the choke gap is sonic. Small fluid borne particles move with a velocity approaching the mean velocity of the stream, and are influenced, depending on size, shape and density, by the large scale turbulence of the stream. The high velocity conditions at the choke throat and' along the downstream trim are therefore particularly conducive to high rates of erosion. Tests were performed on several materials to determine the wear (volume loss) rates in accordance with special erosion procedure. Abrasion wear is associated with surfaces sliding along one another, and is greatly accelerated by fluid borne particulates. Those particulates with sharp corners, such as sand particles so often found in natural gas and crude oil are especially effective in promoting material removal when the choke is being adjusted frequently. Other factors influencing abrasion wear include fluid lubricity, clearances between sliding parts, particle hardness, forces on component parts, and hardness and surface finish of the component parts. Low viscosity fluids, such as gas, provide poor lubricating qualities and negligible protection against abrasive wear.

Abstract This paper deals with the adequacy of scaling methods used for steam-flooding studies in laboratory models of reservoirs containing viscous oils. For highly viscous oils, it was found that accurate capillary pressure scaling is not required. For these oils the ratio of capillary to viscous forces is so low that unscaled capillary pressures have negligible effect on oil recovery behavior. However, in the case of medium-viscosity oils (less than 10,000 cp) unscaled capillary pressures result in prediction of optimistic oil recovery. A technique to bring capillary pressures into scale was investigated, but found to give only qualitative improvement. The technique caused predicted recovery behavior to be sensitive to predicted recovery behavior to be sensitive to flooding rates. Model predictions, after adjustment to field conditions to correct for differences between model and field starting oil saturations and injected steam quality, agree closely with numerical two-dimensional, three-phase calculations of the steam drive process. Oil recovery was found to depend mainly on the heat input per unit volume of reservoir sand. Injection rate was found to be a much less important variable. Introduction Laboratory models have been used for many years to simulate the behavior of a reservoir during thermal recovery operations. Unfortunately, the scaling of thermal recovery processes is difficult in small laboratory models because heat transfer and thermal effects on fluid properties must be accounted for as well as properties must be accounted for as well as capillary, gravity and viscous forces. To achieve complete scaling of capillary, gravity and viscous forces, fluids with properties analogous to those of reservoir fluids are properties analogous to those of reservoir fluids are required. To scale the variation of fluid properties with temperature (especially the properties with temperature (especially the viscosities), the actual crude oil-water system must often be used. Since the temperature dependency of viscosity is critical in thermal recovery models, scaling of capillary forces in these models has frequently been neglected in order to use actual reservoir fluids. Scaling theory of models has been discussed at length in the literature. Yet no quantitative information has been published indicating the scaling parameters having the greatest effect on results obtained with thermal models.

AB  - ABSTRACT The producing wells in South Burgan field, Kuwait Oil Company, have recently reported increase in water cut with simultaneous drop in oil production. Several wells have showed indications of scale formation to varying degrees at the well-heads' chokes and in the flowlines, that transferring the crude to the gathering centers. Scale deposits comprised mostly calcium carbonate with lesser amounts of silicon (formation fines). Inhibited acid cleaning has been carried out to remove the hard scales from the chokes' beans and the flowlines that having significant scale accumulations. Scale inhibition treatment have been adapt utilized. Online internal corrosion monitoring coupons have been installed on the flowlines to monitor the internal corrosion during acid cleaning and routine operation. Similarly, scale coupons have been installed to evaluate the scale inhibitor injection efficiency. Fluid sampling has been carried out during acid cleaning to check dissolved iron (Fe) content as corrosion monitoring indicator and scaling tendency. Radiography has been used to locate and quantify the scale depositions. Ultrasonic thickness scanning has been carried out to ensure the integrity of flowlines during acid cleaning activities. Appropriate recommendations have been provided to the asset owner for controlling the internal corrosion and scaling. This paper discusses the outcome of the work carried out in order to maintain the integrity of the wellheads and flowlines having scaling. INTRODUCTION Calcium carbonate (calcite) accumulations in oil wells is a well known phenomena and cause production upsets due to clogging of wellhead chokes and flowlines. Increased water production rates from a natural flowing well is a primary factor for calcite scaling. As the pressure falls or temperature increases, the dissolved bicarbonate begins to decompose, resulting in increasing pH and decreasing calcite solubility in water. The undissolved carbonate deposits are mainly in the form of calcite/aragonite or other solid forms depending upon the reservoir type. 1,2

AB  - Abstract Calcium carbonate scaling within well tubing and surface piping leads to significant production loss in many oilfields across the world. Scaling tendency of produced fluids increases multi-fold in a mature reservoir with increase in water production and decline in operating pressures. This paper demonstrates the use of modelling to help anticipate scaling issues and convert predictions into operational decision-making which has prevented significant value erosion in a mature field. Majority of the efforts in tackling scaling related losses have traditionally been centered on performing scale treatment after observing a significant change in flow parameters. Although this approach delivers value, it is more reactive in nature and becomes challenging to address in a logistically constrained offshore environment. This paper presents a case study on a new proactive framework on Scale Management. This new framework is driven by P2P approach - Prediction to Prevention. Prediction of scale formation tendency in wells was carried out using a thermodynamic model. Once wells with scale formation tendency were identified using thermodynamic model, scale prevention was done by selection and application of scale inhibitor chemical along with progressively reducing number of surgical acid washes. The scaling behavior was compared against the operating conditions of wells and the findings complemented the understanding from thermodynamic simulations. Paper deliberates on the cost optimization while application of this approach so that it remains extremely cost efficient in comparison to traditional approach. It details the evolution of scale management strategy right from project initiation to field maturation spanning across 30 years of production. With periodic reviews of this framework, additional ~10% of available well stock was identified as new wells migrating into scaling envelope over the last one year and added to Scale Inhibitor dosage program. This prevented production losses and well integrity issues in these wells. Wells put on continuous scale inhibitor injection as per recommendations of this approach did not have down-hole safety valve failures, protecting 35% of field oil production volume and ensuring safer operations demonstrating strong business value. Overall, application of this P2P framework has helped asset to reduce yearly scaling related losses by more than 90%.

AB  - Abstract By utilizing an 8,000-ft experimental field well equipped with 10 gaslift valves and 10 Maihak pressure recorders, gas-lift tests were conducted with port sizes ranging from 5/16 through 1 in. The well was equipped to provide accurate means of measuring surface pressures, temperatures, quantity of injection gas and fluid production. The tests were conducted in 2 3/8-in. OD tubing, and the well was making 95 per cent water. A complete evaluation of gas-lift-valve port sizes shows the relationship of per cent recovery, gas-liquid ratios, minimum pressure created at the operating valve and horsepower requirements for each port. The length of time necessary for the fluid in the tubing to reach equilibrium conditions after each cycle was recorded. Fall-back of fluid at depths of 477, 969, 1,685, 2,493 and 4,290 ft was noted. For each port size, pressure loads of 250, 300, 350, 400 and 450 psi were lifted with a valve operating at approximately 550 psi at 6,000 ft. Gas-liquid ratios for each load were varied from excess gas to a gas volume per cycle whereby the load failed to reach the surface. Numerous curves are presented in evaluating the accumulated data. The results show a 1-in. port to be the most efficient under all conditions. The production of intermittent liquid slugs against different-sized surface chokes was evaluated. These tests were conducted from a 7/16-in. ported valve at 4,072 ft. Tests indicate that, when possible, a 3/4-in. in diameter choke or larger should be used at the surface. Introduction In the past few years most of the advancement in gas-lift operations has been made in continuous-flow operations. Yet, it is estimated that at least 70 per cent of the wells on gas lift in the United States are of the intermittent type. Since the term "slug flow" is sometimes used in both intermittent- and continuous-flow operations, it would be well to distinguish between the two types of flow. Continuous-flow gas lift is defined as a method whereby the fluids are produced at a continuous rate at the surface. This generally requires a continuous injection of gas through a surface choke; however, various other control devices sometimes are installed to eliminate freezing, to shut-off gas during natural flow periods, etc. The actual flow of fluids in the tubing may be of the slug type (one of many flow patterns known to exist in continuous flow). Intermittent flow is defined as a method of gas lift whereby the liquid is produced in separate piston-type slugs. Perhaps this type of flow could best be thought of as a ballistic type flow where the liquid leaves bottom as a piston, propelled by a slug of expanding gas. Gas generally is injected through some type of control at the surface at predetermined intervals. However, the valve may have characteristics whereby gas can be injected through a small choke and still result in a ballistic-type flow. The purpose of the experimental work was to evaluate the most efficient port size to be used on the operating valve for the ballistic type of lift and, in addition, to establish the importance of utilizing a surface choke large enough to allow slugs to be produced without detrimental effects. This work is part of a comprehensive study of both intermittent and continuous-flow gas lift, representing a joint project conducted by the Ohio Oil Co., the Sun Oil Co., Otis Engineering Corp. and The U. of Texas. The problem of evaluating port sizes has been given little previous attention. Some work undoubtedly has been done which has not been published to date. Some tests were conducted when the wireline, mechanically-opened valve (Nixon) first came on the market. This valve was capable of utilizing full tubing area as its port size. It is known that this was a very efficient valve, but to the authors' knowledge the results of tests have never been published. EXPERIMENTAL EQUIPMENT These tests were conducted on an actual field well, the Ohio-Sun Unit Well No. 2-E, in the North Markham- North Bay City field, Matagorda County, Tex. The well incorporated 2 3/8-in. OD tubing and produced 95 per cent water. Since the running of equipment was to be quite elaborate and expensive, a well was selected in which both intermittent- and continuous- flow tests could be conducted. This particular well was capable of producing in excess of 1,000 B/D of liquid (95 per cent salt water), yet with a 3/64-in. in diameter bottom-hole choke, production was controlled to 82 B/D. Most of the intermittent tests were conducted at this low rate. Figs. 1 and 2 show all the surface and downhole equipment. As can be seen, every attempt was made to insure that ample equipment was available for reliable testing procedures. Fig. 1 shows the surface testing equipment. JPT P. 315^

AB  - Abstract In the design of subsea flow systems the integrity and reliability is paramount. As the equipment must be designed to operate at a large variety of conditions, inherent to the many processes, evaluation of the integrity is complex. . Flow induced pulsations and vibrations can cause serious design and production problems, especially in subsea gas production systems. Mechanical vibrations can be induced by internal and external flow through a complex process that is affected by numerous factors such as the piping geometry, flow conditions and fluid properties. Wellhead choke valves are commonly used to control the flow of fluids from the reservoir. During production, significant noise is produced by the flow as it passes through the choke. The noise is of broadband nature: it can be described by pressure pulsations with frequencies over a large range (1-20 kHz). The subsequent vibration levels can become significant when the pressure pulsations match with a certain acoustic or mechanical resonance mode of the production piping, and can lead to an increased risk of failure of nearby equipment. The paper describes a method to examine the mechanical loads on nearby equipment due to the vibrations induced by the usage of a wellhead choke by the means of Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) simulations and Finite Element Modeling (FEM).  Numerical experiments were performed on a generic piping system consisting of standard pipes and bends as well as a fictive ensemble of sensor block and choke valve to explore: 1) the acoustic eigenmodes of the piping, 2) the mechanical eigenmodes of the piping and equipment, and 3) the resulting mechanical loads on the subsea equipment. It is shown that typical frequencies characteristic of noise related fatigue are such that the number of cycles, easily reaching 1010 within a few months, can be regarded as the primary source instead of the maximum stress levels. Some aspects are not considered in the current approach, such as the effect of the medium and the surrounding. These will lead to slightly lower cyclic stress estimates, and will therefore not invalidate the presented method as a worst case estimation of noise induced vibrational stresses.

AB  - AbstractTwo-phase flow through wellhead chokes, including both critical and subcritical flow and the boundary between them, was studied. Data were gathered for air-water and air-kerosene flows through five choke diameters from 1/4 in. (6.35 mm) to 1/2 in. (12.7 mm), and results were compared to published correlations. A new theoretical model for predicting flow rates and the critical-subcritical flow boundary was tested against these data, as well as data from two published studies. The new model substantially improves the existing methods for predicting choke behavior in two-phase flow. IntroductionChokes are widely used in the petroleum industry to protect surface processing equipment from slugging, to protect surface processing equipment from slugging, to control flow rates from wells, to provide the necessary backpressure to a reservoir to avoid formation damage from excessive drawdown, to maintain stable pressure downstream from the choke and dampen large pressure fluctuations. Either critical or subcritical flow may exist. Since different methods apply for predicting choke behavior in these regimes, the prediction of the critical-subcritical flow boundary is also important. The majority of correlations available apply to critical flow only. Pressure drops through chokes can be substantial. For example, in critical flow the pressure downstream from the choke may be as low as pressure downstream from the choke may be as low as 50% or even 5% of the upstream pressure. Modern techniques, like Nodal* Analysis, of analyzing the entire production system require two-phase models of production system require two-phase models of comparable accuracy for each system component. Thus, to optimize the performance of the entire production system, an improved two-phase choke model is required. THEORY For the purpose of modeling, a wellhead choke can be treated as a restriction in a pipe. Two types of two-phase flow can exist in a choke: critical and subcritical flow. During critical flow, the flow rate through the choke reaches a maximum value with respect to the prevailing upstream conditions. The velocity of the fluids flowing through the restriction reaches the sonic or pressure wave propagation velocity for the two-phase fluid. This implies that the flow "choked" because downstream disturbances cannot propgate upstream. Therefore, decreasing the downstream propgate upstream. Therefore, decreasing the downstream pressure does not increase the flow rate. If the pressure does not increase the flow rate. If the downstream pressure is gradually increased, there Will be no change in either the flow rate or the upstream pressure until the critical-subcritical flow boundary pressure until the critical-subcritical flow boundary is reached. If the downstream pressure is increased slightly beyond the boundary conditions, both flow rate and upstream pressure are affected. The velocities of fluids passing through the choke drop below the sonic velocity of the upstream fluids. Here, the flow rate depends on the pressure differential and changes in the downstream pressure affect the upstream pressure. This behavior characterizes subcritical pressure. This behavior characterizes subcritical flow. Although it is often desirable to operate wells under critical flow conditions with uniform flow rate and downstream pressure, Fortunate' reports that a majority of wells in the field operate under subcritical conditions. However, most of the correlations available to petroleum industry are for critical flow. Existing Methods A complete model for two-phase flow through chokes should define the boundary between the critical and subcritical flow regimes and predict the functional relationships of flow rate through the choke and the pressure differential across the choke for a given set of fluid properties and flow conditions. Most existing methods model critical flow only and a few even attempt to define the criticalsubcritical flow boundary. These models are surveyed.

AB  - Abstract Well 1A is a prolific, big bore dry gas well that has been installed with storm choke due to failure of the well's hydraulic control line. Because of its pilot implementation, a one-year trial period was enforced as part of the valve's endurance and reliability test. The objective of this paper is to show findings from a root cause analysis on valve inadvertent closure (trip at FTHP above valve setting pressure) observed after the conclusion of the one-year trial period which had already indicated positive results with 98% reliability. Physical inspection of three separate sets of storm choke that had premature closure issues within a duration of five months were analyzed to find a common root cause. The well parameters were studied versus the known operating envelope to narrow down possibilities that were either naturally occurring or externally induced within the well that could have caused the inadvertent closures. Based on the available data, the root cause remained tentative triggering the need for downhole pressure and temperature data acquisition. Inspections of the retrieved valves revealed common damaged element; the piston O-ring. The O-rings were found to be either leaking, broken or flattened. When analyzing the well parameters, the only significant change detected since the valve installation was the wellhead temperature which had shown increase of 6 degrees Celsius. However, this increase in temperature should not have impacted O-ring's operating envelope. The well was designed to be completed with downhole gauge at approximately 2000 feet above top of perforations to eliminate need for wireline surveys. This limits the ability to verify predicted temperature profile in the tubing. Suspecting the inadvertent closures to be related to temperature, downhole temperature survey was launched to investigate its impact on the valve. Based on the survey, a much higher temperature was recorded at the storm choke valve depth compared to model estimation. This provided the key to provide a conclusive narrative to the storm chokes’ premature closure issues. The higher temperature had inadvertently increased the storm choke's dome charging pressure resulting in physical throttling of the valve when in operation and thus resulting in damaged seals. With the higher temperature being taken into consideration for new dome setting pressure, inadvertent closures of the same nature were no longer observed. This experience will be able to provide a guideline on best practices in managing wells with storm chokes in the future and outline recommendations for parameters to monitor, surveillance requirements, pressure setting determination practices, procedures for valve function testing and valve handling the well and at the yard.

AB  - Abstract Reasons for internal and external valve damage are varied in the industry. Valve damage can occur due to irregular preventive maintenance, sand erosion, internal and external corrosion, improper materials selection, and/or due to operating the valve outside of its operating pressure and temperature ranges1. This paper will focus only on valve cavitation related damage, which happens on water choke valves. The main purpose of this paper is to demonstrate a trial installation of multistage choke valve technology in water lines that reduces high pressure drops across water injection choke valves. The trial test was conducted on two single-stage choke valves installed upstream of two water injection wellheads, which were completed in two different reservoirs. The selected single-stage choke valves were experiencing high noise and vibration levels where operators could barely meet the required water injection rate for each well. Different surface mitigation measures were evaluated to overcome this serious issue prior to conducting the trial installation of the multistage chokes. The field water injection system was studied from the water injection plant (WIP) where the water injection centrifugal pump (3000 psig) is located, through the water lines, fittings and valves all the way to the water injection wellheads. Results from the trial test show that implementing multistage choke valve technology can prevent high noise and vibration levels and allow the target water injection rate per well to be met. Introduction The role of a choke valve in a water injection line may be somewhat underestimated. Water injection involves introducing water into the well using high pressure pumps, coupled with chokes to regulate the pressure and flow rate going into the well. Fundamentally, the challenges facing choke valves within water injection are very distinct from those of production chokes. The main issue occurs as the water undergoes a sudden and substantial pressure drop during its passage through the choke trim. This makes an undesirable and highly damaging phenomenon known as “cavitation.” A sudden pressure reduction causes water to turn into vapor, and the term cavitation is used to describe the subsequent “implosion” of the vapor bubbles back into liquid form.

AB  - Abstract Multiphase flow occurs in almost all producing oil wells and nearly every flowing well has some sort of choke to regulate the flowing rate, for the following reasons: (1) to maintain sufficient back pressure to prevent sand entry, (2) to protect surface equipment from high pressure, (3) to prevent gas or water coning and (4) to produce the reservoir at the optimum flow rate. Present choke correlations are best used for the area where same conditions met with the data used to generate the correlations. Inaccurate flow rate predictions could lead to gas/water coning, sand entry, and excessive pressures at the separator which can be a major factor of killing the producer well. In this paper, actual data production tests from vertical wells from Sabriyah Fields in Kuwait, were utilized to establish a new generalized multiphase flow choke correlation that predicts liquid flow rates as a function of flowing wellhead pressure, gas-liquid ratio, and surface wellhead choke size. The primary proposed correlation exhibits more accuracy (only 4% average error) than the existent correlations. The multiphase correlation coefficient was determined as 89%. These results will undoubtedly encourage the production engineer to utilize the proposed correlation for future practical answers when a lack of available information, time, and calculation capabilities arises. Introduction In a producing well, choke is controlling the production, as well as valves installed for safety purposes. One of the reasons for using choke is to prevent water and gas coning. Much research has been conducted to describe the relationship between the flow rates through wellhead and choke size.  There are two surface conditions under which a flowing well is produced, either using a choke or using no restrictions at all. The majority of flowing wells are produced against chokes. Chokes are used to control flow rates, and thus to produce reservoirs at optimum rates. This also prevents water and/or gas coning and sand problems. Another use of well head chokes is to monitor production rates by operating in the sub critical-flow region, especially when oil and gas are produced from offshore or hostile environments. Flow through the choke can be described as either critical or sub-critical. In a critical flow region, the mass flow rate reaches a maximum value that is independent of a pressure drop applied across the choke. Therefore, once critical flow is reached, any disturbance introduced downstream of the choke will have no effect on upstream conditions. Therefore, chokes are commonly operated on upstream conditions. Hence, chokes are commonly operated under critical-flow conditions to isolate the reservoir from pressure fluctuations introduced by surface equipment.

AB  - Abstract Tengizchevroil (TCO) has implemented Advanced Process Control (APC) to automatically control the feed into the plant by adjusting the chokes of selected wells in the field. The automated choke operations are closely monitored and thoroughly discussed during daily Field-Plant interface meetings to confirm overall stability of the plant performance and improvement in plant efficiency. With the use of a dynamic multivariable model-based controller we are now able to predict the demands from the production facility and automatically deliver the exact amount of field production to meet plant's ever-changing production capabilities while minimizing the pressure losses between the field and the operating plant. The early APC deployments demonstrated the opportunity in delivering highly significant value to TCO. TCO had implemented numerous APC throughout the plants to optimize complicated processes and developed the necessary organizational capability (OC) to implement the Field APC. The Field APC project was the first joint project involving both the field and the plant assets. This APC project demonstrated the "One TCO" approach, with support and buy in from a cross functional team of Automation, Reservoir Management, Process Engineering and Plant Operations personnel. TCO is now able to automatically react to changes in both the field and plant to deliver the maximum plant capacity at any given moment. Since plant throughput limitations are constantly changing due to changes in ambient temperature, H2S content or gas-oil ratio (GOR) of the inlet feed, etc.; the APC is automatically adjusting the output from the wells to match the inlet requirements of the plants. The solution uses dynamic models to predict constraints and drive operations to an economic optimum while honoring an everchanging set of constraints. The APC allows the plant and field operators to spend more time addressing non-routine problems by automating one of the operator's routine duties.

AB  - A Note on an Elementary Iterative Problem The iterative problem x = f (x )...............................(1) k+1 k frequently occurs, in one form or another, in reservoir engineering calculations. The convergence problem is that of obtaining from Eq. 1 a sequence problem is that of obtaining from Eq. 1 a sequence of iterates xk that approach a finite solution x* = lim k->oo (xk) assumed to exist. Obviously, x* = f(x*). The function /may be an explicit algebraic function or a long and complex algorithm. Since the former case is easily handled by the Newton-Raphson technique, this discussion is pertinent to the latter case. Convergence of this iterative process is easily analyzed and is discussed by a number of authors, including Wegstein. Denoting this error in the kth iterate by k we have by definition xk = x* + k. Substituting accordingly for xk and xk+1 in Eq. 1 and employing a Taylor expansion, we have for small x* + k+ 1 = f(x* + k) = f(x*) + k f'(x*)..(2) Since x* = f(x*), this equation gives k+1 ---- = f' (x*),..............................(3) k and the condition for convergence is simply f;(x*) less than 1. In cases where f'(x*) is close to or greater than 1, convergence often can be accelerated or obtained by weighting i.e., Eq. 1 is replaced by x = w f(x ) + (1 - w) x ................(4) k+1 k k Repeating this above error analysis gives k+1 ----- = w f'+ 1 - w ,.........................(5) k k+1 and an optimum weight factor is given by -------=0, or k 1 w = --------,...............................(6) 1 - f' Eq. 3 and 6 lead to some qualitative observations. Eq. 3 shows that if 0 less than f' less than 1 then convergence should be monotonic in the sense that the successive iterates should approach the value x* from one side. The error k will be constant in sign. Further, Eq. 6 shows that in this case convergence might be accelerated by use of weight factor w greater than unity. If f' greater than 1 then divergence should be expected in use of Eq. 1 but Eq. 6 shows that use of a negative weight factor might result in convergence. If - 1 less than f' less than 0 then Eq. 3 indicates an oscillatory convergence i.e., overshoot followed by alternating sign on the successive errors k. Eq. 6 indicates that in this case a weight factor between 0.5 and 1 might speed convergence. Finally if f' less than - 1 then Eq. 1 will give divergence; but convergence might be obtained by using Eq. 4 with weight factor between 0 and 0.5. We recently encountered an example of the iterative problem, Eq. 1, in a senior class in natural gas engineering. In a two-dimensional, single -phase computer calculation, the total production rate, Q, from a heterogeneous gas production rate, Q, from a heterogeneous gas reservoir was calculated from the equation Nw Mcf Q ------ = Ci (pi-pw),.................(7) day i=l where Nw is the number of wells in the reservoir; Ci is a constant reflecting an assumption of quasi-steady-state only within the small grid block containing the well; pi is average pressure in the grid block; and pw is flowing well pressure. The program actually solves for and uses potentials program actually solves for and uses potentials rather than pressures but the present form will suffice for illustration. The desired field deliverability rate Q was specified for each of a sequence of time steps covering the producing period of interest. During each time step, the period of interest. During each time step, the program performed a small number of iterations, in program performed a small number of iterations, in part to determine the value of wellbore producing part to determine the value of wellbore producing pressure pw (same for all wells) necessary to give pressure pw (same for all wells) necessary to give total field production rate equal to the desired, specified value Q.

AB  - AbstractReplacement of existing steel choke and kill lines on a drilling riser string with composite lines will result in weight savings that will allow third generation mobile offshore drilling units to operate in 6,000 feet of water depth without undergoing major upgrades. The design and analysis, fabrication and qualification testing of high pressure (15,000 psi) composite choke and kill lines is discussed. The objective is to develop a low-cost composite design of reliability equivalent to that of existing metal systems.IntroductionReplacement of the steel choke and kill lines on a standard drilling riser string with composite tubulars will result in a 15%-20% weight saving. Table 1 is a weight comparison of a typical 4.5" steel choke and kill line with a comparable composite line. This straightforward substitution would allow a third generation mobile offshore drilling unit (MODU) to operate in water depths as great as 6,000 feet without major upgrades. One of the limiting factors in taking a MODU out into deepwater and ultra-deepwater is the deckload capacity of the vessel. Mooring lines, riser joints, hook, and variable loads all contribute to this weight. A variety of other limitations require third generation semisubmersibles to undergo major upgrades before they can operate in water depths as great as 6,000 feet.For composite lines to be widely accepted, they must be designed to be 100% interchangeable with existing steel lines, with no modifications required to the riser pipe body, flange, brackets or buoyancy modules. When installed on a steel main riser pipe and flange joint, these composite lines create a hybrid drilling riser system. Such hybrid riser joints would then be completely interchangeable with the all-steel riser joints of a deepwater riser system.The market focus for a hybrid riser system is very specific. The drilling and production units being targeted are those third generation rigs on the edge of deepwater that want to be able to drill in 6,000 feet of water without undergoing major upgrades. The use of hybrid riser joints will lighten deckload, hookload and craning requirements for these MODU"s. Equally important is the reduction in the volume of syntactic foam buoyancy needed to support the riser joints underwater. Foam modules with a smaller outside diameter can be used, allowing the hybrid riser to be run by many of the vessels operating on the fringe of deepwater which still have 49.5- inch rotary tables. Another advantage to the use of smaller diameter buoyancy is the narrower profile of the riser string in the water, which reduces the drag forces of the sea currents.Composite Choke and Kill Line RequirementsThe API specification for choke and kill systems (Ref. 1) states that: "Choke and Kill Lines are an integral part of the surface blowout prevention equipment required for well control. The kill line provides a means of pumping fluid into the well bore when normal circulation through the drill string cannot be employed.

AB  - Abstract As the petroleum reserve discovery goes deeper in the offshore oil industry, high pressure reserves are discovered. Those wells will produce at very high initial flowing wellhead pressures (> 10,000 psi) and at much lower flowing wellhead pressures after a period of production. This presents a significant challenge for design and operation of the production system, especially, the subsea production choke, being required to have very low flow coefficient (Cv) in early life to restrict flow, and very high Cv in late life to reduce pressure loss. Initially, the pressure across the choke is required to be 5000 psi or higher. Associated with the high pressure loss across the choke, the Joule-Thompson effect will cause much higher temperatures (up to 30 - 40 °F) at the downstream of the subsea choke compared to non-restricted flow. The elevated temperature challenges the materials of the downstream equipment and the pipelines/risers. This paper presents an innovative concept ¾ using dual subsea chokes to split the pressure to protect the chokes and improve production operations. The advantages and disadvantages of using dual subsea chokes are presented. Introduction Major High Pressure High Temperature (HPHT) reserves are being developed in the North Sea and the Gulf of Mexico. The learning curve has been very steep on key completion technologies, subsea equipment and installations. The range of pressure and temperature are not well defined as industry consensus. In the UK sector of the North Sea the wells are called HPHT wells with a reservoir pressure (>14,500 psi or 1000 bar) and high temperature (>266°F or 130°C) [1]. In the Gulf of Mexico (GoM), operators are looking at the ultra-high pressure and temperature prospects (>25,000 psi and >450°F) [2, 3]. The current deepest well is completed at 29,860 ft TVD. New discoveries may exceed 30,000 ft. A three-tier classification has been proposed for well completion in the paper [2]: Tier I: 15,000 psi (1034 bar) and 350 °F (177 °C ) Tier II: 20,000 psi (1379 bar) and 400 °F (204 °C ) Tier III: 30,000 psi (2068 bar) and 500 °F (260 °C ) Fluid characterization regarding sour/sweet service is a major challenge to set the design criterion for well tabular and subsea equipment, including the choke body and trim material selection. Figure 1 shows the subsea choking requirement on subsea choke to maintain low flowline pressures. In a 10,000 ft water depth, if a well is completed at 30,000 ft TVD, the choking pressure loss is about 5000 psi, the water depth and pipeline pressure loss is about 3500 psi and wellbore pressure loss is about 7,000 psi. The reservoir pressure loss is usually in the range of 500 -1,500 psi. Those numbers are not precise calculation results, instead, only to show the magnitudes of each component in a deepwater HPHT production system. A reliable subsea adjustable choke is essential to a subsea production system. The critical challenge is trim material and configuration. A historic review for choke development was presented in references [4, 5]. A list of parameters for selecting a subsea production choke has been presented in reference [5] and being slightly modified and shown as Table 1. The flow characteristics of orifice-type and cage-type subsea chokes have been investigated [6]. Effective choking is critical to apply HIPP systems to the subsea pipeline [7, 8]. The choke is required to set the pressure at the inlet well below the design pressure to allow for flow transients and to provide sufficient time for HIPPS valve to close in the event of a pressure increase due to blockage. Background Recent discoveries of High Pressure High Temperature oil and gas reserves in the Gulf of Mexico and the North Sea presented a significant challenge to subsea production technologies, and especially for the production control. Most significantly, while the pressure differences at early production are estimated to be around 5000 psi or even higher, they are expected to substantially decrease over time. Such anticipated pressure gradient is difficult to manage in a safe and economic manner using currently known technology.

AB  - Abstract Solids production has been an issue in the oil and gas industry for years. Several materials and configurations have been tested under different conditions to determine how to produce fluids more efficiently when abrasive solids are present. This paper discusses well-testing operations involving formations with the potential for solids production. The discussion focuses on the choke manifold, which is a crucial piece of equipment used during testing operations. The choke manifold facilitates dual-flow paths that control the well flow at surface from the upstream control equipment to the downstream process equipment and allows the operator to perform choke changes without interference to operations or test objectives. It is responsible for controlling the flow rate, upstream choke pressure, downstream choke pressure, and for maintaining critical flow. These tasks are easily achieved using a single choke when no solids are produced. However, when solids are present during the flow through the choke manifold, erosion can occur in the choke body and beans. When these parts are damaged, the well should be shut-in and all operations suspended to repair the damaged equipment. Previous experience shows that the use of chokes in series combined with a high-resistance material (tungsten carbide) improved the choke manifold capacity to work with abrasive solids with less erosion issues. Such capability relies on the lower velocity and pressure changes provided by chokes in series. The choke configuration was tested in the field with a high abrasive flow (gas with solids) and resisted, as expected. Computational fluid dynamics (CFD) simulations were used to analyze the flow-velocity profiles in the flow path of the choke manifold. This study presents a comparison of these results with actual field data (pressure upstream and downstream of the choke manifold during different flows) to demonstrate how the three-choke system can provide safer operations with abrasive flows.

AB  - Abstract With the successful installation, commissioning, and operation of the first All Electric System in the Dutch Sector of the North Sea, the All-Electric Subsea Controls Systems technology continues to prove its advantages. As the 2-off subsea trees are currently gaining field experience, proving their defined targets such as e.g. improved reliability & availability and real time feedback, spin-off technology already has been developed. Considering a customer survey and subsequent market analysis the need for an electric high precision choke being controlled from a standard electro-hydraulic multiplexed Subsea Control Module (SCM) clearly has been identified. A mature development initiative planting the design on the successfully field proven CameronDC™ Choke was initiated. The DC electric Standalone Choke can be controlled from an electro-hydraulic multiplexed SCM utilizing minimum power consumption along with a standardized CANopen interface enabling high precision choke control, continuous position feedback, and improved operatability. In combination with dedicated Choke Control Software flow from multiple wells for enhanced recovery can be optimized. Along with the description of the experience gained during the development this paper will discuss the inherent advantages of the DC electric Standalone Choke applied to subsea production systems.

AB  - AbstractThe main purpose of this paper is to present the technology of hybrid tubes developed to reduce the mass of auxiliary lines of drilling risers used in ultra deep water, by replacing conventional choke and kill lines with lighter tubes. They are composed of a steel core hoop wound with a strip made of carbon fibers impregnated with a polyamide thermoplastic resin.The paper describes the structure of hybrid tubes, the design methodology and the manufacturing process. It presents all the tests carried out to qualify the technology and the conditions of the field test in preparation aboard a drillship offshore Angola. The principle of their integration in riser joints is described. Finally, the architecture of drilling risers including hybrid tubes is commented and their technical benefits are discussed.In conclusion, studies performed at IFP prove that hybrid tubes reduce the weight of auxiliary lines by 50% and that this technology is well suited for ultra deep drilling risers.IntroductionIn recent years there has been a great increase in the number of wells drilled in the very deep offshore, in water depths initially slightly greater than 2000 m and now in depths approaching 3000 m. Several drilling rigs of a new generation were recently put in service to allow such operations [ref. 1]. Their huge dimensions facilitate the production and the maintenance of the necessary drilling fluids, as well as the storage and the use of a large number of tubulars. Among these, the drilling riser is definitely one of the key components for these complex operations; therefore its design and make up procedures must be studied with a great attention [ref. 2].Drilling riser problematicsThe main function of the drilling riser is to extend the borehole throughout the water column in order to guide the drillstring and to return drilling mud and cuttings to the surface. It is composed of tubular elements of 21" outside diameter, joined together by mechanical connectors. It links the drill floor of the floating vessel to the subsea wellhead where the BOP allows the well to be closed in the case of blow out. To ensure the control of the well in such a situation, the riser is equipped with two high pressure auxiliary safety tubes, called kill & choke lines. A third auxiliary tube, called booster line, is used for injecting an additional flow of mud at the bottom of the riser to facilitate the return of the cuttings. Finally, one or several hydraulic lines complete the architecture of the riser. All these tubes are integrated into the 75 ft long riser "joints". Each joint of riser is also equipped with buoyancy modules made of syntactic foam to reduce the wet weight of the system.When studying a drilling riser, the designer has to size the tubes, connectors and buoyancy modules so that the stress levels in the system remain acceptable in all operational conditions [ref. 3]. One of the most important parameters to control is the tension in the riser, particularly at the top end.

AB  - AbstractYukos Oil Company is the second largest oil production company in Russia, and produces 1.2 million barrels daily, with > 60% of this coming from fields in W. Siberia. Base oil and gas production units are located in the European part of Russia (OAO Samaraneftegaz) and W. Siberia (OAO Yuganskneftegaz and OAO Tomskneft VNK) [1]. This production comes from a variety of fields, and it is common for these fields to produce at significant water cuts. Produced water leads to several production and cleanup problems (since it is also re-injected), one of these being the problem of mineral scale.The most common scale is calcium carbonate and this is found in both mild and more severe scaling cases. Sulfate deposits are present too in minimal amounts. However, a feature of the W. Siberian reservoirs is that they have many thousands of wells. Therefore, although the technical problem of treating a single well may not be large, the approach and logistics to protect such a large number of wells is a significant challenge.In this paper we survey the problems of scale in these W. Siberian fields and we outline how Yukos has approached this challenge.IntroductionTwo production units, OAO Tomskneft and OAO Yuganskneftegaz, carry out the main oil production in Western Siberia on the territory where Yukos has licenses. Fig.1 shows the geographical placement of Yukos's main production and refining units. A brief description of them is presented below. OAO Tomskneft VNK. OAO Tomskneft VNK is the principal Production Association of Yukos subsidiary OAO "Vostochnaya nefteyanaya kompanya", also known as VNK or the Eastern Oil Company. Established in 1966, Tomskneft VNK has produced more than 2 billion barrels of oil since it began its operations. 21 fields are currently under development or in production. Tomskneft VNK operates in the remote western part of the Tomsk Region in Western Siberia. Some of its more unusual assets include its own fleet of river barges and approximately 1,000 kilometers of service roads. Since over 70% of its recoverable reserves fall into the "difficult recovery" category, Tomskneft VNK has introduced advanced technologies for horizontal drilling and deep hydraulic fracturing of formations. It has also begun to acquire additional licenses for the development of several new areas in the Tomsk Region.At present there are 1880 production and 840 injection wells in operation. The average oil rate is 170 bbl/day, and the average water cut is 65%.OAO Yuganskneftegaz. OAO Yuganskneftegaz is the Yukos Oil Company's largest Production Association - and the second largest in all of Russia. Yuganskneftegaz, located in the Khanty-Mansi Autonomous Area of Western Siberia, first began operations in 1964, and has produced over 9 billion barrels of crude to date. At present, Yuganskneftegaz manages 29 fields, the largest of these being Priobskoye, Prirazlomnoye, Mamontovskoye, Malo-Balykskoye and Salymskoye.The Priobskoye field is unique as to its geological structure. Recoverable reserves are estimated at 3.01 billion barrels. Prirazlomnoye has 2 billion barrels reserves; a three-dimensional seismic survey of the field has revealed the existence of promising areas that could significantly increase production there.In order to improve well operation, Yuganskneftegaz is introducing hydraulic fracturing and implementing a program to increase efficiency and reliability at its production sites. The program includes improving the power supply system, purchasing additional up-to-date well equipment, and establishing a network of production supervisors.At present there are 6000 production and 2300 injection wells in operation. The average oil rate is 169 bbl/day, and the average water cut is 71%.OAO Tomskneft VNK.OAO Tomskneft VNK is the principal Production Association of Yukos subsidiary OAO "Vostochnaya nefteyanaya kompanya", also known as VNK or the Eastern Oil Company.

AB  - Summary Use of wellhead chokes to monitor and control well flow rates and to protect the reservoir from surface pressure fluctuations is quite common. This study investigates the use of multiple-orifice-valve (MOV) chokes in the critical-flow region. Experimental data collected for a high-pressure air/water system show that conventional relationships are not successful in analyzing the experimental data for MOV chokes. A new relationship based on the sonic velocity of two-phase homogeneous mixtures is developed for the prediction of the critical-flow transition. The procedure uses choking, rather than liquid sonic velocity, as the criterion for critical flow in the liquid phase. The procedure is iterative but compensates for its complexity with high reliability and generality. The new relationship is validated by experimental data. Introduction Wellhead chokes are installed on wells to control flow rates and to protect the reservoir and surface equipment from pressure fluctuations. Flow through the choke can be described as either critical or subcritical. In the critical-flow region, the mass flow rate reaches a maximum value that is independent of the pressure drop applied across the choke. Therefore, once critical flow is reached, any dis-turbance introduced downstream of the choke will have no effect on upstream conditions. Therefore, chokes are commonly operated under critical-flow conditions to isolate the reservoir from pressure fluctuations introduced by surface processing equipment. A second use of wellhead chokes is to monitor production rates by operating in the subcritical-flow region, especially when oil and gas are produced from offshore or hostile environments. For these applications, it is advantageous to use MOV chokes that allow the size of the choke opening to be changed while the choke is under pressure without interruption of production. With this feature, the pressure drop across the choke, and thereby manipulation of the flow rate, can be remotely controlled. Surbey et al. I discussed in detail the application of MOV chokes in the subcritical-flow region. This investigation presents the application of MOV chokes in the critical-flow region. The limitations of conventional correlations in predicting critical-flow behavior for MOV chokes is also discussed. A new correlation is presented to predict the transition between critical and subcritical flow that is applicable to conventional chokes as well. Literature Review Several investigators have published correlations to predict the tran-sition between critical and subcritical flow. Wallis developed relationship to predict the sonic velocity in a two-phase homogeneous mixture. The equation can be written as (1) The liquid sonic velocity, v*, is assumed to have a constant value of 4,950 ft/sec [1509 m/s] for water, and the gas sonic velocity, v* is calculated from (2) When the mixture velocity in the choke throat equals the sonic velocity predicted from Eq. 1, critical flow is reached. Fortunati proposed a different correlation to predict sonic velocity. Using a no-slip condition between the phases, he propose that the sonic velocity of the mixture be given by (3) which assumes no mass transfer between the phases. He also proposed a relationship to predict the flow rate in the critical flow region assuming a discharge coefficient ranging from 1.02 to 1.035, depending on choke size. Ashford and Pierce derived an equation to predict the upstream-to-downstream-pressure ratio at the critical-flow transition. The liquation assumed that the derivative of mass flow rate with respect to this pressure ratio is zero at critical-flow conditions. The inherent assumptions were that the gas expands polytropically, that no slippage occurs between the phases, that the liquid is incompressible, and that frictional losses are negligible in the choke. One of the uncertainties of the model, as stated by Ashford and Pierce, is the definition of p . Ideally, p is the lowest pressure reached in the choke. In practice, this value cannot be measured easily and without uncertainty. Using their relationship for the occurrence of critical flow, Ashford and Pierce developed an equation to predict critical flow rates. In predicting these flow rates, they pointed out the uncertainties involved in precisely measuring the downstream pressure. Sachdeva et al. extended the work of Ashford and Pierce and proposed a relationship to predict the critical pressure ratio. They assumed that the gas phase at the choke entrance contracts isentropically but expands polytropically. Their model showed improvement over the Ashford and Pierce relationship for their own data. In addition to the above relationships, several investigators used field data to develop correlations to predict flow rates in the critical region. These relationships are of the form (4) where A, B, and C are constants given in Table 1 for various investigators. Gilberts reported that his correlation is very sensitive to changes in choke size and that an error of 1/128 in. [0. 198 mm] in d can introduce errors of 5 to 20% in the calculations. Omaha et al. developed an empirical correlation based on dimensionless groups. Regression coefficients were determined with experimental data obtained from a high-pressure natural-gas/water system. Two difficulties were evident in the prediction of the transition between subcritical and critical flow for MOV chokes. First, the measurement of p was difficult because of peculiarities in the choke design. As a result, the downstream pressure was measured only for fully recovered flow. Second, the shapes of the choke openings vary with choke design and cannot be defined as a simple circular hole. As MOV chokes are closed, the shape of the opening becomes more and more noncircular, creating a problem in defining an equivalent circular diameter. In view of these difficulties, a different approach was taken in analyzing critical-flow data. This approach was also found to be suitable for conventional chokes operating in critical flow. Results and Discussion The experimental data were divided into two groups, subcritical and critical flow, on the basis of a comparison of the downstream-to-upstream-pressure ratio to literature correlations. When all three correlations predicted a given data point to be in the critical region, that point was assumed to be critical. All other tests were grouped in the subcritical region. This procedure was necessary because direct identification of critical two-phase flow was not possible owing to the design of the test facilities. The overall range of experimental parameters is given in Table 2.he simplest method to correlate the critical flow data was through the use of a Gilbert-type relationship, such as Eq. 4.

Abstract A method is described for simulating coning into a wellbore using a numerical simulation model. The method allows the wellbore cells to be considerably larger than the actual wellbore. This makes coning studies feasible using an implicit pressure-explicit saturation type pressure-explicit saturation type model with a reasonable time step. This capability is achieved by scaling the horizontal-vertical permeability ratios to give the permeability ratios to give the proper vertical potential drop. proper vertical potential dropIntroduction Water coning into producing oil wells is often a problem in oil reservoirs underlain by bottom water and occurs due to potential gradients established around the well bore by oil production. If vertical permeability exists, this difference permeability exists, this difference in flow potential raises mobile water into the well bore. Gravity forces caused by the density difference between fluids tend to counteract the dynamic and imbibition capillary pressure gradients. When the combined pressure gradients. When the combined effect of dynamic forces and capillary pressure exceeds the gravitational pressure exceeds the gravitational force, the water advances toward the well and eventually breaks through in it. A two-dimensional, two-phase mathematical model was developed in radial coordinates for this study to simulate water coning in petroleum reservoirs. The first step in developing this model consisted of deriving a partial differential equation suitable for describing the pressure distribution in a two-dimensional pressure distribution in a two-dimensional system. The derivation of the equation allowed the simultaneous flow of two slightly compressible phases. These partial differential equations were partial differential equations were then expressed as finite difference equations with respect to both the space and time variables. The entire model was discretized in two dimensions in order to accomodate the finite difference form of the equations. The simulator provides for variable size rectangular blocks on the face of a vertical section (See Figure 1).

AB  - Summary Equations that describe isentropic (adiabatic with no friction loss) flow of multiphase mixtures through chokes can be deduced from the general energy equation. These flow equations are valid for both critical and subcritical flow. Equations, physical property correlations for oil/water/natural gas systems, and a property correlations for oil/water/natural gas systems, and a computer method that will handle both flow regimes are described. The procedure will determine whether flow will be in the critical or subcritical regime. The analysis method has been tested by comparing measured and calculated flow rates of 1,432 sets of literature data comprising both critical and subcritical air/water, air[kerosene, natural gas, natural gas/oil, natural gas/water, and water flows. An average discharge coefficient of 0.826 gave a negligible average error with a 15.4% standard deviation. Introduction In oil fields, it is a common practice to flow liquid and gas mixtures through chokes. Both surface and subsurface chokes may be installed to control flow rates and to protect the formation and surface equipment from unusual pressure fluctuations. In addition to installed chokes, irregular choke-like constrictions also may play a dominant role in limiting the flow rate from a blown-out play a dominant role in limiting the flow rate from a blown-out well. System that involve condensation of the gaseous phase, such as steam/water, are not considered in this paper. Also, flow conditions that would lead to choke throat pressures equal to or less than the vapor pressure of the water phase are not considered. Under "subcritical" flow conditions, the mass flow rate of a stream will be a function of the pressure downstream of the choke when the upstream pressure is held constant. If the pressure drop across the choke becomes sufficiently large, the flow regime will become "critical" and the mass flow rate will be independent of the downstream pressure when the upstream pressure is held constant. Several investigators have described studies of critical and subcritical flow. A thermodynamically based theory and empirical correlations have been reported. The empirical correlations generally are valid over the range where experimental data were available but may give poor results when extrapolated to new conditions. The literature shows little success in correlating the conditions that determine the boundary between critical and subcritical flow. The purpose of this paper is to review the thermodynamic basis, develop a theoretical framework, and show that this approach is valid for both subcritical and critical flow. Correlations of oil, gas, and water properties then are combined with the thermodynamic framework to yield a computer program for calculating isentropic flow. Discharge coefficients, which relate actual flow to ideal frictionless flow, were determined by use of experimental data available in the literature. Energy Balance for Multiphase Mixtures The thermodynamic framework for multiphase critical flow is based on the principal of conservation of energy. As a flowing mixture approaches a constriction, its velocity will increase and the pressure will fall. Little time or area is available for heat pressure will fall. Little time or area is available for heat transfer; thus, the expansion of the gaseous fraction is essentially adiabatic. Consequently, the temperature of the flowing mixture also changes. Beginning with the general energy equation, the relationship between variables at any point in the flowing system can be determined based on these assumptions (1) that temperature varies with position, but at any point, all phases are at the same temperature; (2) that velocity varies with position, but at any point, all components are moving with the same velocity; (3) that the gas compressibility factor is constant; (4) that the liquids have a negligible compressibility compared to gas; (5) that elevation changes are negligible; and (6) that the flow process is adiabatic and frictionless. Appendix A shows the derivation of equations that relate the pressure in the throat of the choke to the mass flow when the upstream pressure is known. The necessity to conserve energy leads to the pressure is known. The necessity to conserve energy leads to the interesting phenomenon that a maximum mass flow rate is achieved at a specific throat/upstream pressure ratio; the critical pressure ratio, however, depends on inlet conditions. As Appendix A shows, this critical flow condition can be determined by differentiation of the general energy equation.

AB  - Abstract This paper reports on experimental work focused on modifying choke design with the aim of reducing oil droplet break-up in the choke in high water-cut production wells. Producing oil under such conditions, with the oil dispersed in the produced water, leads to severe break-up of the dispersed oil droplets. This break-up is caused by high energy dissipation in the choke. Previous work carried out in Delft indicated that, under identical process circumstances (tubing diameter, flow-rate, pressure drop, oil type and concentration), the break-up process is significantly influenced by the choke geometry. In this work we discuss possible ways of modifying the choke geometry to reduce droplet break-up.Three model chokes were tested in the laboratory: an orifice, a small choke consisting of 7 parallel tubes and a larger choke consisting of 13 parallel tubes. These chokes were tested at identical flow rates and with the same pressure drop across the chokes. The larger model choke was the superior one in the sense that in this device the least break-up of oil droplets took place. In the small model choke more break-up occurred, while the most severe break-up was observed for the circular orifice. A general conclusion of the investigation is that the intensity of the break-up process occurring in the (model) choke can be considerably reduced by adaptation of the choke design. A choke design based on parallel tubes gives opportunities for improving the choke performance with regard to oil droplet break-up, while still making it possible to vary and control the volume flow-rate as with a conventional choke. This investigation suggests that it will be possible to construct chokes with improved characteristics with regard to oil-droplet break-up in high water-cut wells. This will result in easier separation and less emulsion-forming downstream of the choke. Introduction Production of oil from a reservoir usually implies that, at a certain point in time, water will be produced as well. While production and time progress, the percentage of water will increase. This situation will continue as long as the production of oil is economically feasible. In practice this means that commonly oil is produced under high water-cut conditions. This water-cut, i.e. the relative amount of water, can be of the order of 95-99 vol. %, and thus the produced fluids contain only a few percent of oil. Under high water-cut conditions the oil, as it enters the well-bore, will be dispersed in the water in the form of droplets. According to Janssen et al.1 the oil droplets have a wide distribution, with the common characteristic that the smallest droplets have a size of the order of 20 µm. The precise value of this lower limit is determined by several parameters of which we mention: properties of the porous medium, in particular the permeability and the wettability, the fluid velocity near the well, and the oil properties, mainly the dynamic viscosity and the interfacial tension. Subsequently, in the production tubing, droplet break-up will occur but - due to the relatively moderate turbulent conditions - only for the less stable larger droplets, thus the smaller droplets remain unaffected2. Separating these oil droplets, varying in size from 20 µm and larger, from the produced water can be easily accomplished. Hydrocyclones are for example capable of separating oil droplets efficiently with a minimum size range of 15 to 20 µm in diameter3,4. Unfortunately the situation is not as simple as sketched above. In the production system a device is necessary to control the production flow-rate, viz. the choke, and this choke is placed at the surface, between the production tubing and the separation facilities. A crucial and necessary property of the choke is that it generates a pressure drop within the system. This leads to the occurrence of high energy dissipation and, consequently, to severe break-up of oil droplets, with the result that - after passing the choke - the oil-water mixture is much more difficult to separate into the two different phases than upstream of the choke because now a large amount of very small droplets is present, and these very small droplets are much harder to remove.

Ithas been used in approximately 75 wells located in Louisiana, Texas,Mississippi, Oklahoma, Mexico, Kuwait and India.Sun Oil Company's Gulf Coast Division, through the use of this tool duringthe past four years, has saved approximately $289,000 in tubular goods, andproduced approximately $282,750 worth of hydrocarbons not otherwiserecoverable.The paper reports the results of Sun Oil Company's installations anddiscusses the various applications and limitations of the tool.The method of allocating production to each zone is explained and theadvantages and disadvantages in the simultaneous production of two separatereservoirs through a single tubing string are enumerated.Construction and OperationFigure 1 shows a well equipped to receive a multiple completion chokeassembly. A retainer-type packer separates the two producing zones. The upperpacker is optional. A side-door choke landing nipple hookup is located in thetubing string above the lower packer. The multiple completion choke assemblywill be locked in this landing nipple. Normally located a joint or two abovethe upper zone, the position of the landing nipple hookup can be varied to suitwell conditions. For example, where the two zones are widely separated, itmight be placed just above the lower packer to facilitate bottom-hole pressuretests of the lower zone.The tool consists of two separate assemblies, as shown in Figure 2.The outer assembly, which is run on a wire line and locked in the landingnipple, contains the check valves and packing seals which prevent flow from onezone to the other.The orifice-head assembly, which carries the tungsten carbide choke beans,is run separately and is seated and locked in the outer assembly. The method ofrunning each section is illustrated in Figure 3.

AB  - Technology Update The efficiency of the gas/liquid separation process can have a significant impact on the economics of planned and potential oil and gas developments, as well as on the profitability of existing production operations. A new type of choke valve that improves the efficiency of downstream gas/liquid separators by enhancing the coalescence of dispersed liquids in a fluid stream has been developed recently by Twister. The initial field test of the technology, known as the SWIRL valve, was performed at a JT-LTS production unit operated by NAM in the Netherlands. The test demonstrated that the replacement of a conventional JT valve with the coalescing choke valve resulted in a significant improvement in the dewpointing performance of the gas-processing facility. This retrofit also allowed the maximum plant operating flow rate to be increased from 650 000 to 735 000 m3/d, while still meeting export gas specifications. It was additionally found that by using the coalescing valve, the temperature in the cold separator (SMSM type) could be increased by 4–5°C while still meeting specification, allowing a reduction of approximately 3 bars in the plant feed pressure. Furthermore, it was demonstrated during the field test that the glycol losses normally experienced were significantly reduced.    This article presents the initial field-test results and an overview of the subsequent development and deployment of the coalescing-valve technology. Technology Description Pressure throttling in a conventional choke valve is achieved by dissipation of the kinetic energy present in the gas flow through randomly distributed eddies. The new coalescing valve, which was developed with the aid of proprietary computational fluid-dynamics models, uses the excess free pressure in a fluid stream to establish a coherent vortex motion. The total pressure inside the vortex core is gradually reduced along the axis of the flow path. By reducing the total pressure in a vortex flow, the flow shear rates are lower, compared with conventional chokes, thereby avoiding excessive breakup of liquid drops. However, and more importantly, these micron-size droplets are concentrated around the perimeter of the flow path, thus enhancing the coalescence to larger, more easily separable droplets.

AB  - When a well is brought on production, the selection of an optimum choke management strategy is aimed towards maximizing well productivity and minimizing the risk of typical wellbore failures during the early life of a well. In this study, a quantitative method is presented for the selection of a choke management strategy that minimizes the risk of the predominant failure mechanisms in hydraulically fractured wells and frac-pack completions. For example, in unconventional resources, an improper choke management strategy may trigger the back flow of excessive amounts of proppant, resulting in fracture closure and possible wellbore damage and loss of production. In frac-packs and high-rate water packs, an abrupt increase in the rate (or drawdown) may induce completion damage resulting in impaired production and possibly sand production, requiring excessive and costly workovers. It is shown that in hydraulically fractured wells, choke management strategies should aim towards minimizing pressure gradients along the fracture, thus making proppant flowback and potential reduction/loss of fracture conductivity or its connectivity to the wellbore less likely to occur, for a given set of formation properties and closure stress. Choke management strategies are compared for a wide range of formation and fracture properties including fluid properties, matrix permeability, fracture conductivity and fracture length. Results indicate that in unconventional formations (k<0.01md) there is a unique choke management strategy, which consistently appears to be the best. The methodology is coupled with previous studies that have focused on determining the critical pressure gradient for which proppant flowback is observed. In frac-packs and high-rate water packs, completion failure may occur due to excessive fluid velocities along the frac-pack or exaggerated pore pressure gradients at the completion sandface. Choke management strategies are compared for a wide range of formation and completion properties. Results indicate that in frac-packs and high-rate water packs, the selection of the optimum choke management strategy is similar to that of open-hole completions, with bean-up operations achieving a relatively higher reduction in pressure gradients for the case of low values of dimensionless fracture conductivity. The greatest reduction in pressure gradients can be achieved by considering bean-up operations during completion design. The results of this study provide, for the first time, a clear methodology for selecting choke management strategies in hydraulically fractured wells and frac-pack completions for a wide range of reservoir and fluid properties.

AB  - Summary With emphasis on deepwater wells and marginal offshore fields growing, the search for reliable subsea production systems has become a high priority. A reliable subsea adjustable choke is essential to the realization of such a system, and recent advances are producing the degree of reliability required. Technological developments have been primarily in (1) trim material (including polycrystalline diamond), (2) trim configur-ation, (3) computer programs for trim sizing, (4) component materials, and (5) diver/remote-operated-vehicle (ROV) interfaces. These five facets are overviewed and progress to date is reported. A 15- to 20-year service life for adjustable subsea chokes is now a reality. Another factor vital to efficient use of these technological developments is to involve the choke manufacturer and ROV/diver personnel in initial system conceptualization. In this manner, maximum benefit can be derived from the latest technology. Major areas of development still required and under way are listed, and the paper closes with a tabulation of successful subsea choke installations in recent years. Introduction Most large reservoirs on the Continental Shelf have been developed. This area between shore and 200-m [650-ft] water depth constitutes about 7.6% of the total ocean area. Industry experts project that subsequent discovery and production for the next several years will be directed toward marginal field development and the Continental Slope (from 200- to 3000-m [650- to 9,850-ft] water depth and about 15.3% of total ocean area). I Marginal fields and wells in these deeper waters reduce an operator's return on investment. Low prices for oil aggravate the situation. For the U.K. sector of the North Sea, some analysts state that the current economic climate makes new investment in the U.K. Continental Shelf unfavorable. In Brazil, "Evaluation results of what is believed to be the biggest onshore oil strike in the nation's history has state-owned Petrobras reconsidering expensive deepwater drilling." Subsea production systems appear to offer the most viable solution to these problems. Installation costs are much lower. Investments are returned more quickly. Existing fixed production facilities may be better utilized. For various reasons, however, many operators have avoided subsea production and opted for platform/ hybrid-platform configurations.djustable subsea production chokes have been singled out as one of the major critical components in a subsea production system. These chokes are vulnerable because they are subject to severe service and a tough environment. But they offer several advantages: use of subsea manifolds to commingle wells flowing at different pressures; the ability to bring wells on stream and to shut them down gradually to prevent formation damage; accurate flow control for the life of the reservoir in both production and water-injection applications; protection for isolation valves from damage resulting from being the primary valve across which frill pressure drop occurs; and a reduction in the number of risers and flowlines. An operator, therefore, must choose between a fixed/fixed-hybrid platform (which is expensive and depth-limited and involves long construction time) or a subsea system (which is less expensive and not depth-restricted and offers short installation time, but has questionable reliability and potentially high maintenance costs). Table 1 lists some benefits for each type of installation. Recently, the hardware and technology available in adjustable subsea chokes have steadily improved. Major developments have taken place in the interim to alter the situation significantly. The principal technological advancements are polycrystalline diamond, tungsten carbide, and stellite trim material to extend trim life in subsea use; a choice of trim configuration [plug cage, multiple orifice valve (MOV), needle and seat, multistage] to match application demands and thus to extend trim life; computer programs based on empirical flow-test data to size trim for extended service life; new selections available in the component material, such as the latest duplex stainless steels, improved coatings, and new elastomers to minimize deterioration and failures; and reduced downtime and vulnerability with maximum flexibility through diver/ ROV-retrievable packages containing parts most likely to fair or to require change-out. With all the new technology properly applied, it is now realistic to talk about 15- to 20-year service life. No longer will it be appropriate to insist on the luxury of "putting your hands on the adjustable choke. " In the current environment and with the dramatic equipment improvements, subsea production systems may represent a company's economic survival. How Have Subsea Chokes Evolved? The first subsea choke valves were topside, manually operated chokes modified with "saltwater exclusion seals" and grease-packed for pressure compensation. Valve-stem position indicators were the same as those used topside, and divers could not read them. It was not uncommon to hear horror stories of choke valves that were cut out in only minutes. And understanding the resistance to installing such a vulnerable component subsea is easy. When Shell Expro and Exxon South Cormorant underwater manifold center (UMC) was being designed and constructed, no available adjustable subsea chokes were reliable enough to be considered, so fixed-bean chokes were used instead. Now, however, retrievable subsea chokes are in final development stages that will overcome the envelope and operational restrictions of the existing system. The first major progress in improving subsea choke-valve design came about as choke manufacturers began to respond to requirements for specific installations for a single customer. The economies of design and manufacture of a standard product are obviously lost in such a process. Forced primarily by market conditions, user and supplier are now searching for common grounds and resulting cost reductions for reliable products. Maximum Cost-Effectiveness Comes From a Total System Approach As choke reliability becomes a reality for subsea production, another factor has emerged. The choke-valve manufacturer should be involved with the user from the beginning of system design. The choke is an integral part of the system that requires support from other subsystems. Proper planning provides the flexibility that operations people appreciate. It is one thing to try to fit a choke into an existing design; it is quite another to develop a system and its component parts as an integrated solution to specified operating and maintenance problems. Maximum benefits will best he achieved when user, choke manufacturer, and ROV contractor share ideas and technology during initial system conceptualization. Table 2 summarizes various factors to be considered in choke selection. SPEPE P. 301^

AB  - Performance improvement and mitigation of downhole sand plugging has resulted in minimizing the net pressure condition created within an induced-fracture network. Restricted well drawdown minimizes the physical loss of the induced stimulation, a loss which leads to downhole plugging. Using downhole chokes in liquid-unloading applications maintains high flowing sandface pressure conditions. This creates improved reservoir performance and improved well operations, and also saves costs by mitigating surface hydrate formation and fracture sand flowback.

AB  - Summary In this study, a quantitative method is presented for the selection of a choke-management strategy that minimizes the risk of the predominant failure mechanisms in hydraulically fractured wells and frac-pack completions. In unconventional resources, an improper choke-management strategy may trigger proppant crushing or the flowback of proppant, resulting in fracture closure and loss of production. In frac packs and high-rate water packs, an abrupt increase in the rate (or drawdown) may induce completion damage, resulting in impaired production and sand production and requiring excessive and costly workovers. Choke-management strategies should aim to minimize near-wellbore pressure gradients along the fracture, thus making proppant flowback and loss of fracture conductivity or connectivity with the wellbore less likely to occur. Choke-management strategies are compared for a wide range of formation and fracture properties, including fluid properties, matrix permeability, fracture conductivity, and fracture length. Results indicate that in unconventional formations (k < 0.01 md) there is a unique choke-management strategy that consistently appears to be the best. The methodology is coupled with previous studies that have focused on determining the critical pressure gradient for which proppant flowback is observed. In frac packs and high-rate water packs, completion failure may occur because of excessive fluid velocities along the frac pack or exaggerated pore-pressure gradients at the completion sandface. Results indicate that the selection of the optimal choke-management strategy is similar to that of openhole completions, with beanup operations achieving a relatively higher reduction in pressure gradients for the case of low values of dimensionless fracture conductivity. The greatest reduction in pressure gradients can be achieved by considering beanup operations during completion design. The results of this study provide, for the first time, a clear methodology for selecting choke-management strategies in hydraulically fractured wells and frac-pack completions for a wide range of reservoir and fluid properties. A general framework for beanup operations is defined and then used to compare beanup strategies for hydraulically fractured and frac-pack completions. It is hoped that this paper will contribute a theoretical foundation to the current diverse operator practices.

AB  - Abstract The aim of this study is to understand the effect of choke management strategies on the productivity of a Multi-Frac Horizontal Wells (MFHW) completed in a liquid-rich (gas-condensate) unconventional reservoir. The focus is the investigation of the how controlling drawdown during depletion impacts the formation, extent and structure of a condensate bank near the multiple fracture faces and how controlling bank formation through controlling drawdown influence productivity. Analysis of these productivity impacts was used to evaluate the most effective choke management practices in ultra-low permeability gas condensate reservoirs. Several fine grid compositional simulation models for MFHW completed in ultra-low permeability gas condensate reservoirs were developed. Parametric simulation studies were then performed using fluids with varying descriptions (e.g. dew point, initial CGR), varying reservoir properties (e.g. reservoir pressure, reservoir permeability) and varying well completion characteristics (e.g. fracture conductivity, distance between fractures). Condensate bank development was monitored in these simulations for various choke management scenarios. The effectiveness of each choke management scenario was evaluated and the best approaches were identified. There exists a misconception that for gas condensate produced from unconventional reservoirs, there is no benefit in managing drawdowns through choke adjustments. This misconception rises from the idea that in an unconventional gas condensate reservoir, large drawdown is required to produce the gas, and as a result, the pressure must fall below the dewpoint nearby wellbore and a degradation in performance due to condensate banking cannot be avoided. The results of our study show that, in some situations, the liquid recovery and cash flow per well can be maximized through choke management resulting in controlling the size and form of the condensate bank created. The main determining parameters is initial reservoir headroom (pi − pdew) and drawdown (pdew- pwf). If the head room is high, or intermediate, there is value in choke management, i.e. controlling (pdew- pwf), for both maximizing liquid recovery and also cash flow. However, if head room is essentially zero, then it is better to open the choke fully, i.e. maximize (pdew- pwf), from the beginning. In this last case, there is still a small incremental benefit in choke management if maximizing oil recovery is the primary value driver. This study shows that we can produce at BHP below dewpoint and still have CGR (t) remain a large fraction of initial CGR for significant producing times. The trick is to produce the well at condition close to succession of steady state. In this case, the size of the condensate bank remains compact, controlled and often relatively small over the production time of interest. This condition can continue until end of fracture linear flow regimes and beginning of Pseudo boundary dominated flow regime when the whole SRV goes to depletion mode. Note these results show that standard PVT descriptions can produce CGR(t) close to initial CGR for long periods during production and imply that dewppont suppression due to confinement in small pore spaces is not always required to achieve this.

AB  - ABSTRACT: The surface morphology and chemistry of two chokes for oil and gas condensate, which failed by leakage, were related to the flow pattern and material degradation mechanisms. In the choke for oil production, severe circumferential channeling develops near the screw connection between the nozzle and choke body, due to fluid leakage through the thread in imperfect contact. One of the channeling branches crossed the case wall producing leakage, this trajectory being enhanced by defects in the girth weld, inappropriately placed near the thread. Downstream, CO2 induced corrosion becomes the governing damage mechanism, being promoted by an almost stagnant back-flow in the annular gap between the nozzle and the choke body. In the second case, the corrosive fluid induces intense erosion-corrosion downstream the nozzle; the abnormal flow pattern is the consequence of the prior fracture of the nozzle. Toward the valve outlet, the damage turns into uniform CO2 corrosion, which is the typical degradation mode of the choke body. Both failures were enhanced by the inappropriate location of girth weld in the zones where the most intense erosion-corrosion damage occurs. INTRODUCTION: Chokes in oil and gas wellheads are valves which reduce the flow and, correspondingly, the fluid pressure to values sustainable by the surface pipeline. In some wellheads configurations, the choke, deviates the flow at 90°. Chocking-back the well to relatively low production rates tends to decrease the sand content in the flow, and implicitly, the erosion intensity. However, the risk of erosion-corrosion damage persists in those cases where choking leads to an important increase of flow velocity. This risk is higher if, additionally, the hydrocarbon fluid contains corrosive agents and remnant fine sands, even in low concentration. In such cases, the service life for choke valves may decrease from 1 - 3 years to very short time intervals, in extreme cases even as low as few days [1]. The main component of the choke (nozzle or reducer) is the most vulnerable to erosion, being typically made of a sintered WC-Co insert in a steel housing. Other wear resistant advanced materials, such as hard coatings, “tough” ceramics (e.g. partially stabilized zirconia) and polycrystalline diamond have been tested to increase the life-time of the choke nozzle [2 -4]. The case or body of the choke may be either a single cast piece or forged sections that are girth welded; material grade and manufacturing method depends upon the required mechanical resistance and fluid corrosiveness. Flow induced damage is not expected to be intense in the choke body, except cavitation downstream the reducer which, however, is unlikely to occur under normal operating conditions [5]. EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURE: The typical failure analysis routine was followed: i) Information and sample recovery in the field; ii) Chemical and microstructural characterization of the material; iii) Surface damage analysis by visual inspection, scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDX). For both studies, the choke body was cross sectioned on the symmetry plan, and then samples were extracted for microstructural and SEM-EDX analysis.

AB  - Choke management strategies vary significantly among operators and no rigorous methodology exists for properly selecting choke sizes when constraints are placed on completions, wellbores and fluid pressures and velocities. Bringing a well on production too fast may significantly compromise productivity or even result in completion failure with particularly severe implications in offshore developments. Examples of constraints placed on bean-up strategies include, limiting the maximum drawdown to minimize the risk of sanding or proppant crushing. This paper presents a methodology for translating such constraints to the required choke sizes and durations i.e. a specific bean-up strategy that will respect the constraints placed on the system. In this study, we propose a coupled wellbore-reservoir model that performs dynamic nodal analysis using integrated models for surface facilities, wellbore and reservoir simulators and allows an operator to select choke sizes as a function of time. Illustrative examples of the method are shown for a conventional and an unconventional well. Results indicate that the choke schedule strongly depends on both the reservoir and wellbore properties. As a result, empirical and general guidelines should not be used across the board. Instead a quantitative analysis is recommended for a given set of surface, wellbore and reservoir properties to ensure a successful ramp-up. This study provides an integrated and systematic approach for selecting choke sizes for oil and gas wells.

AB  - ABSTRACTWith growing emphasis on deepwater wells and marginal offshore fields, the search for reliable subsea production systems has become a high priority. A reliable subsea adjustable choke is essential to the realization of such a system and recent advances are producing the degree of reliability required. Technological developments have been primarily in: (a) trim material (including polycrystalline diamond), (b) trim configuration, (c) computer programs for trim sizing, (d) component materials, and (e) diver/ROY interfaces. These five facets are overviewed and progress to date reported. A 15-to-20 year service life for adjustable subsea chokes is now a practical reality. Another factor vital to efficient utilization of these technological developments is to involve the choke manufacturer and ROV/diver personnel in initial system conceptualization. In this manner, maximum benefit can be derived from the latest technology. Major areas of development still required and underway are listed, and the paper closes with a tabulation of successful subsea choke installations in recent years. INTRODUCTIONMost 1arge reservoirs on the Continenta1 Shelf have been developed. This area between shore and 200 m. water depth comprises about 7.6% of the total ocean area. Industry experts project that subsequent discovery and production for the next several years will be directed toward marginal field development and the Continental Slope (from 200 to 3000 meters water depth and about 15.3% of total ocean area). Both marginal fields and wells in these deeper waters reduce an operator's return on investment. Low prices for oil aggravate the situation. In the U.K. sector of the North Sea, some analysts state that the current economic climate makes new investment in the U.K. Continental Shelf unfavorable. In Brazil, "Evaluation results of what is believed to be the biggest onshore oil strike in the nation1s history has state-owned Petrobras reconsidering expensive deepwater drilling." Subsea production systems appear to offer the most viable solution to these problems. Installation costs are much lower. Investments are returned more quickly. Existing fixed production facilities may be better utilized. However, many operators for various reasons have avoided subsea production and opted for platform/ hybrid-platform configurations. Adjustable subsea production chokes have been singled out as one of the major critical components in a subsea production system. These chokes are vulnerable because they are subject to severe service and a tough environment. But, they offer several advantages: use of subsea manifolds to comingle wells flowing at different pressures wells can be brought on-stream and shut down gradually to prevent formation damage accurate flow control for the of the reservoir in both production and water-injection applications protection for isolation valves from damage resulting from being the primary valve across which full pressure drop occurs can reduce the number of risers and flowlines.

AB  - Abstract ASP flooding in Daqing oilfield commenced from 1980s. To date, industrial pilot tests have been carried out in three blocks. The averaged recovery was increased by 20%. On the other hand, scaling issue caused high frequent pump failures. Large amount of scale building up in the producers wellbore and downhole equipments with high speed, which resulted in the averaged running life of lifting system decreased from 599 days of water flooding period to 60 days. Further more, some producers' running lives were only around 30 days, leading to higher production cost and lower production rate as well. Study indicated that, the scaling principle and scale composition in producing wells differed from each other and was difficult to be predicted accurately. In this study, after tracking and measuring the ion in produced fluid for the whole process from water flooding, polymer flooding to ASP flooding and analyzing composition of the scale on different parts of scaling well, the criterion and distinguishing chart of scaling tendency had been set up initially. The criteria were applied in 102 wells in ASP flooding area, the accordance rate was more than 90 percent. Based on that, scaling inhibition technology was timely performed for predicted scaling wells, and the running lives were increased from 40 days to above 200 days. This paper presented the process of the study and is greatly helpful for APS flooding in commercial scale. Introduction ASP flooding industrial pilot tests in Daqing Oilfield showed that it has got an oil recovery increase of average 20 percentage points than water flooding, and this technology will be an important mean to further enhance oil recovery in the late high water cut stage in Daqing Oilfield. But in the process of continuous injection of ASP fluid, some problems are also exposed, among them, scaling and high frequent pump failure has been a significant problem for ASP flooded wells, which results in short running life of lifting system, low production efficiency, and increased operating costs. It has seriously affected the normal production of oilfield, and has become one of the bottlenecks for the industrial application of ASP flooding. According to statistics of each ASP flooding block in Daqing Oilfield, scaling wells account for 76.9% of total oil wells in the same block. Therefore, it is necessary to realize timely and effective scaling prediction, scale prevention and removal for ASP flooded wells. Through tracking and measuring the ion in produced fluid for the whole process from water flooding, polymer flooding to ASP flooding and analyzing composition of the scale on different parts of scaling well, this paper studied scaling ions variation rules and scale composition characteristics in different ASP flooding stages, and established the criterion and distinguishing charts of scaling tendency for different blocks, which have been applied in ASP flooding areas with accordance rate more than 90 percent. According to the scaling prediction method, scaling inhibition technology was timely performed for predicted scaling wells, and the running lives were greatly extended.

AB  - This paper was prepared for the 44th Annual Fall Meeting of the of the Society of Petroleum Engineers of AIME, to be held in Denver, Colo., Sept. 28-Oct. 1, 1969. Permission to copy is restricted to an abstract of not more than 300 words. Illustrations may not be copied. The abstract should contain conspicuous acknowledgment of where and by whom the paper is presented. Publication elsewhere after publication in the JOURNAL OF PETROLEUM TECHNOLOGY or the SOCIETY OF PETROLEUM ENGINEERS JOURNAL is usually granted upon request to the Editor of the appropriate journal, provided agreement to give proper credit is made. Discussion of this paper is invited. Three copies of any discussion should be sent to the Society of Petroleum Engineers office. Such discussion may be presented at the above meeting and, with the paper, may be considered for publication in one of the two SPE magazines. Abstract Experimental field tests were conducted to study the multiphase flow of gas and liquid [gas-water system] through a small-sized choke in a vertical position. The resulting flow patterns were photographed through patterns were photographed through transparent nipples placed immediately upstream and downstream from the choke. A correlation relating flow rates [gas and water], upstream pressures, gas-liquid ratios and orifice sizes was derived from the experimental data and is presented in this paper. The correlation has a limited range paper. The correlation has a limited range of application and is valid for critical flow conditions. It should be useful for choke sizing for both downhole and surface systems. Introduction Multiphase flow of gas and liquid occurs frequently in the petroleum, chemical and related industries. In the petroleum industry gas-liquid mixtures are transported through vertical and horizontal pipes from the reservoir to the wellhead, from the wellhead to the gas-liquid separator and to the stock tank. The refinery receives the mixture which undergoes further traveling from distillation and separating units to final storage. During both vertical and horizontal flow the well production may encounter restrictions in the form of valves, pipe size reductions and/or purposely placed orifices or chokes. The latter restrictions are placed at the wellhead or at the bottom of the well with the object either to measure the flow rate or to control the flow rate by imposing a backpressure on the formation. The choke or orifice can be used to predict the resulting upstream pressure associated with the new desired flow rate or a correct choke size may be selected for a particular flow rate. This assumes, of course, that a suitable correlation is available. The use of chokes in dual installations allows the production of two zones at bottom through one string of tubing. The two zones are commingled at the bottom through a dual flow choke. This procedure eliminates the need of producing two zones through two separate strings. A very significant consideration is that the correct size of choke to be used to allow the required flow rate from each zone must be accurately known. under this premise the various regulatory bodies permit dual installations to be produced permit dual installations to be produced through one string of tubing.

AB  - ABSTRACTMany planned new developments in the North Sea will involve the exploitation of hostile high pressure, high temperature gas condensate reserves. The extremely high pressure letdown over the wellhead choke leads to very high flow velocities, and consequent risks of erosion damage occurring to the choke internals. In a recent study, measurements of erosion have been performed during an offshore well test under flowing conditions using advanced Thin Layer Activation techniques and scaled Laboratory tests.INTRODUCTIONMany planned new developments in the the North Sea will involve the exploitation of hostile high pressure, high temperature gas condensate reserves. The economics of these prospects dictate that very high flowrates will be encountered in producers. Combined with this, the extremely high pressure letdown over the production choke will ensure high flow velocities, and consequent risks of erosion dainage occurring to the choke internals. In addition, the frequent presence of hydrogen sulphide and carbon dioxide add a significant corrosion risk and additional mechanism for material removal.

AB  - Abstract Proppants are used to keep hydraulic fractures open and maintain conductivity for hydrocarbons to produce at higher rates. Diagenetic growths or scales formed under in situ well conditions caused by interactions between proppants and formation minerals within the presence of water can reduce conductivity and cause a decline in production revenue. Previous papers have reported the various geochemical reactions that may occur under downhole conditions, which can cause scaling on alumina-based proppants. This paper describes a study of diagenetic materials received with proppants that have flowed back from a fractured well. The preliminary examination of the samples under a high-resolution microscope revealed the presence of ceramic proppants, formation dust/sand, and polymers. Microscopic examination revealed white-colored deposits/scaling on the surface of the proppants, which can obstruct fracture conductivity. The polymers from the flowback samples were physically separated from the solids before analysis. Formation dust/sand and proppants were also subjected to X-ray diffraction (XRD) study, which revealed the presence of zeolites and carbonates. The original core cuttings from the respective locations were also studied for the availability of zeolites or carbonates. The study was performed in the following steps: The flowback samples were studied using a microscope for initial assessment. The samples were studied using XRD for the identification and quantification of phases. The original cores from respective locations were studied using XRD to check the presence of zeolites or carbonates. The post-frac flowback water was studied using inductively coupled plasma atomic emission spectroscopy (ICP-AES) and ion chromatograph (IC), respectively, for cations and anions responsible for carbonate scale formation and the water properties supporting scale formation. This paper provides a systematic method of analyzing flowback samples to help determine the downhole conditions responsible for the occurrence of diagenetic scale.

AB  - Abstract This paper shows the importance of Artificial Intelligence (AI) techniques as a practical engineering tool for predicting and estimating the gas flow rate through chokes. Studying the single gas flow through wellhead chokes is vital to the oil industry, not only to ensure the accurate estimation of gas flow rate but also to keep equipments protected from damage due to high gas flow rate. It also has the potential to avoid sand problems. Many studies have investigated the predictability of gas flow through chokes. In this paper, we reviewed, evaluated and compared the predictive performance of the available choke correlations in literature with five AI techniques. 162 data points were used to develop five AI models for predicting the gas flow rate. The data were fed to the five AI techniques Artificial Neural Network (ANN), Fuzzy Logic (FL), Support Vector Machine (SVM), Functional Network (FN) and Decision Tree (DT) (ANN, FL, SVM, FN and DT) and the results were optimized for each technique. The new models were found to perform better than the correlation and give the lowest error, with a mean absolute percentage error of 0.83%. Because of these reduced errors, the proposed AI-based models can improve gas flow rate prediction through chokes. The results of this paper will provide a better alternative to predictive modeling of petroleum reservoir properties. It will also open windows of opportunity for researchers and engineers to explore advanced machine learning techniques such as hybrids and ensembles for continued improvement of petroleum exploration and production. Introduction Artificial Intelligence (AI) techniques have been effectively and successfully applied in Petroleum Engineering. Although some engineers and researchers refer to them as “black box”, however a number of attempts have been made to demystify them. Mohaghegh and Ameri (1995) and Mohaghegh (2000) wrote that “just because they are not immediately visible does not mean one cannot examine what goes in those layers” and they suggested calling it “transparent box” instead of “black box”. Anifowose (2011) presented a succinct review of the application of AI techniques in Petroleum Engineering and argued that they should be seen as "white box". In additional to all these, studies carried out for over three decades have continued to prove the efficiency and effectiveness of AI techniques in Petroleum Engineering applications.

AB  - AbstractFor oil production under high water cut conditions the efforts needed for de-oiling of the production water are mainly determined by the oil-droplet-size distribution of this water. This distribution is predominantly the result of droplet breakup in the choke valve. To determine the effect of the choke valve on the droplet-size distribution, we have conducted laboratory experiments in which we used a circular orifice in a circular pipe. With the help of theory on droplet break-up in turbulent flow and with knowledge of the flow field inside an orifice, a prediction of the distribution after break-up can be made. It is shown that the droplets increase in size with increasing oil viscosity and furthermore it appears that, for the description of the break-up process, the distribution of the turbulence over the orifice zone is an important factor.P. 525

Abstract It is possible to find in the literature, some papers concerning the two phase flow through the wellhead chokes, but nearly all these contributions concern only the critical flow. The critical flow, when only the gas is concerned, happens around a choke downstream - upstream pressure ratio of about 0,5, but this condition is no more valid as the flow is two phase (gas and liquid). The velocity of a two phase flow, both critical and subcritical, is greatly depending from the gas concentration in respect to the mixture, and the downstream - upstream pressure ratio can be also lower than 0.225. pressure ratio can be also lower than 0.225. The practical cases, as experienced during several years, are nearly all in the subcritical flow field, and in the present paper, a simple formula is given for calculating the rates through the wellhead chokes, covering both the critical and subcritical flow fields. The equation below reported, can be easily also developed through a computer program. In the text, the number between square brackets, refer to the literature, and the numbers between round brackets, refer to the equations. This paper is mainly intended for practical purposes, some unavoidable calculation developments were confined in the Appendixes. A full relief was given to the illustrative numerical examples and through all the paper the metric system of units is used. Introduction Since recently two phase flow is receiving more and more attention by the researchers working in the oil industry. It can be said that no one month passes without appearing in the literature, scattered over the world, a contribution concerning this item. The impulse to these researches came from the observation that the pressure drop through a pipe, when flowing a gas/oil mixture, can be also ten times more than that due to a single phase flow. Two phase flow is characterized by two functions, and , which are defined as: (1) Where: Fg = cross section area of the choke passage occupied by the gas phase - m2; Ft = Total cross section area of the choke passage-m2; qg = Gas rate at P2 and T = qog x B g -; m3/sec; qog = Gas rate at standard conditions Po and To - m3/sec; ql = liquid rate = q B at p and T-m3/sec; q = liquid rate at standard conditions Po and To - m3/sec. The multiphase flow can be as these patterns; - Dispersed flow; - Annular flow; - Wave flow; - Slug flow; - Plug flow; - Stratified flow; - Bubble flow; Generally the gas, when flowing with liquid (for ex. oil) through a pipe, slips over the liquid and, due to this condition and have different values, as shown on fig. 1, for the frequent case of plug flow (17).

AB  - AbstractWe report on an investigation into optimization techniques that could be useful for the automatic matching of production data. One key objective is to extract the maximum amount of information from the data. Our starting point is a series of grids of differing refinement starting at a coarse scale and an associated set of property parameterizations at increasing resolutions. Automatic optimization algorithms are investigated that utilize the differing scales. The aim is to develop optimization methods that can extract maximum information from the production data and are fast and robust enough for practical use.The algorithms written for this study, which were initially developed for stand-alone single-phase flow models, have subsequently been implemented in a system using a standard commercial simulator. The results presented here are for synthetic models using a simulated truth case; the models are introduced in order of increasing levels of realism.IntroductionIn the recent past it has become possible to instrument oil and gas fields such that continuous measurement can be made for a number of parameters. This new high quality data should give engineers the opportunity to improve the predictive quality of their simulation models. In this paper we are interested in developing numerical methods that can extract value from continuously measured production data, typically down-hole pressure and multi-phase flow rates. Firstly we would like to understand the information content of the production data stream. The second issue is to make a quantitative assessment of how different optimization strategies can be employed to extract the information content in a robust and efficient manner. Individual optimization techniques have not been tuned in general or for the specific test problems considered. Rather the goal has been to understand which broad class of method will ultimately lead to a practical tool.The work to date has been of theoretical nature using synthetic models and hence does not yet consider more practical consideration such as noisy data. Some results in the recent literature1 indicate that the synthetic case is worth separate consideration as it may raise issues that need to be addressed before tackling real world data.Automatic history matching, in particular using gradient-based techniques, has a long history2-9. However, it is the authors? belief that currently the implementation techniques have not proved robust or fast enough to have gained widespread use in day-to-day reservoir engineering. A simple exampleWe firstly consider a simple example that illustrates the class of problems that we are interested in. Figure 1 shows a 10*10*3 simulation grid containing 10 wells, 5 producers and 5 injectors giving a line drive across the field. The properties are homogeneous in each of the three layers. The wells are set on rate control for the majority of the run, however each well is shut periodically, mimicking in a very simple manner either a field maintenance operation or a test designed to interrogate the reservoir. Figure 2 shows the rate and typical bottom hole pressure history.

AB  - Abstract Scales such as aluminum silicates are commonly believed to come from reservoir rocks such as shale and/or their interaction with injected chemicals from EOR (enhanced oil recovery) methods. In hydraulic fractured wells, scales could be a major source of damage to fracture conductivity, which is usually less than 5% of their desired value by fracturing design. Despite much research on conductivity loss, few efforts have been directed at proppants, the number one material by quantity (except for water) used in fracturing operations. In this research, a brief review is conducted on how proppants might be an active agent in scale-generating reactions. Using a ceramic proppant sample from the Bakken shale oil field as an example, a new method is proposed for characterizing proppant strength and interaction with fracturing fluids, rock, and formation and production fluids under realistic down-hole conditions. It was found that certain ceramic proppants widely used in the Bakken field are vulnerable in weakly acidic fluids (i.e. pH=4). Temperature increases expedite the proppant weakening process. Estimated conductivity loss could be ~50% compared with that treated at neutral pH. This is alarming because many wells produce sweet (carbon dioxide CO2) and/or sour (hydrogen sulfite H2S) gas along with production fluids. Common scale inhibitors such as phosphonate-based acids and polycarboxylic acids (PAA) could also lower the pH of fluids in propped fractures to 3~4, break the ceramic proppant and generate fines and scales. The first lesson learned is that proppants could be a source of scale. Proppants, especially ceramic ones, should be treated as a chemical and potential source of scale when implementing designs for hydraulic fracturing or gravel packing. Not only will poor quality proppants crush easily, but also they may generate migrating scales, a double inhibition for flow assurance. Extreme care should be exercised when choosing proppants for sour wells. Tighter specification on acid resistance of proppants is proposed. Field quality control and scale management in fractured wells will also be discussed.

AB  - ABSTRACT This paper aims to study the application of choke models as a part of virtual metering system (VMS) to predict the flow rate of natural gas wells. In this paper, three semi-empirical choke models, including Perkins, Sachdeva and Al-Safran, are investigated. Combining with the 12424 groups actual production data obtained by flowmeters of A1 and A2 wells in the underwater gas field in the South China Sea, the flow coefficients are defined to modify those models. The results show great agreement with field production data and the results of wellbore model (a calculation module of the VMS). In addition, Perkins model of which the average error is 8.23% and the standard deviation is 5.48% is more accurate relative to Sachdeva and Al-Safran model. Considering the error of flowmeter and the fluctuation of production data, those choke models can be developed as a part of VMS to predict natural gas flow rate. INTRODUCTION With the further development of the oil and gas industry moving to the seas continuously, underwater oil and gas production process have been born. Achieving continuous measurement of oil and gas wells is one of the most basic technical requirements during its producing processes. The harsh natural environment in the deep sea makes it difficult for the flowmeter to be installed and it costs a fortune to maintain (Varyan et al., 2015). As the alternative, a relatively new single well metering management software, virtual metering system (VMS), has been gradually adopted in the domestic and foreign offshore oil and gas field production systems (Bello et al., 2014). The flow rate of oil and gas in the single well can be calculated out through several different kinds of modules with VMS technology utilizing the field basic process parameters and the real-time instrumental data obtained from the Data Communication System (DCS). VMS technology is highly integrated, which provides great convenience for the operators. In contrast to traditional techniques, VMS is more convenient in operation as its highly integration, cheaper for installation and maintenance (Paz et al., 2010), (Petukhov et al., 2011). Another advantage of VMS is that it can be employed in combination with real-time flow management system. Hence, VMS can be used as a replacement of traditional multiphase metering equipment or as a supplementary or backup scheme of an entity flowmeter in an offshore gas field (Wu et al., 2015a). Some technology companies in this area have developed a variety of corresponding systems which were successfully used and achieved good results in some deep-water oil and gas fields in North Sea, Mexico Bay and West Africa, such as the FAS system of FMC company, OLGA online system of SPT company, ISIS system of BP, WPM system of TOTAL (Wang et al., 2015). The research in this area has just begun in China. Our group is researching and developing a flow monitoring and management system relying on multiphase flow simulation technology. In January 2014, this system based on wellbore model was successfully put into use in a certain gas field in the South China Sea (Wu et al., 2015b) (Wang et al., 2014). After nearly three years of operation, it turned out that the VMS system has been running smoothly and the hardware malfunctions never happened. The individual flow and total flow calculated by VMS are in good agreement with the measurement results of the flowmeter on the platform. Our VMS meets the accuracy requirements of engineering practical production, thus creating considerable economic benefits and value (Wang et al., 2013).

AB  - AbstractSachdeva's choke flow model has been found capable of predicting critical-subcritical boundary and liquid and gas flow rates for multiphase crude systems. Although this model was shown to be accurate by Sachdeva et al.(15) in their original paper using laboratory and field data, inaccuracy of the model has been found in other field applications. In this study, the accuracy of the choke model was evaluated using data from 239 oil wells and 273 gas condensate wells in Southwest Louisiana. Comparisons of results from measurements and model calculations indicate that the model is more accurate for oil wells than for gas condensate wells. It was found that the error of the model could be minimized using different values of choke discharge coefficient (CD). For oil wells, CD = 1.08 should be used for liquid rate prediction and CD = 0.78 should be used for gas rate predictions. For gas condensate wells, CD = 1.07 should be used for gas rate predictions and CD = 1.53 should be used for liquid rate predictions.IntroductionWellhead chokes are equipment used in the oil and gas industry to control fluid production rates from wells, to maintain stable pressure downstream from the choke and to provide the necessary backpressure to a reservoir to avoid formation damage from excessive drawdown. Because oil and gas production rates are extremely sensitive to choke size, accurate modeling of choke performance is vitally important for petroleum engineers in oil production simulation.Tangren et al.(1) performed the first investigation on gas-liquid two-phase flow through restrictions. They presented an analysis of the behaviour of an expanding gas-liquid system. They showed that when gas bubbles are added to an incompressible fluid above a critical flow velocity, the medium becomes incapable of transmitting a pressure change upstream against the flow. Several empirical choke flow models have been developed in the past half century. They generally take the following form for sonic flow:Equation (1) (Available in full paper)where:Pwh = upstream (wellhead) pressure, kPaQ = gross liquid rate, m3/dayR = gas-liquid ratio, scm/m3S = choke size, cm and C, m and n are empirical constants related to fluid properties. On the basis of the production data from Ten Section Field in Cal-ifornia, Gilbert(2) found the values for C, m and n to be 2.4644, 0.546 and 1.89, respectively. Other values for the constants were proposed by different researchers including Baxendell(3), Ros(4) and Achong(5). Poettmann and Beck(6) extended the work of Ros to develop charts for different API crude oils. Omana et al.(7) derived dimensionless choke correlations for water-gas systems.Fortunati(8) was the first investigator who presented a model that can be used to calculate critical and subcritical two-phase flow through chokes. Ashford(9) also developed a relation for two-phase critical flow based on the work of Ros. Gould(10) plotted the critical-subcritical boundary defined by Ashford, showing that different values of the polytropic exponents yield different boundaries. Ashford and Pierce(11) derived an equation to predict the critical pressure ratio.

AB  - Abstract In mature fields, pipelines are often oversized for their operating conditions. This is because their design was primarily based on the early and plateau production and less on late life production. This oversizing may lead to slugging issues, whereby flow fluctuations cause liquid handling problems in the receiving facilities, which can lead to system trips. The purpose of this paper is to describe the workflow, which includes identifying the operational problems, designing the slug control system, and commissioning and monitoring of the control system. The Smart Choke developed by Shell1 is able to mitigate the effects of slugs and has now been installed at several locations worldwide. It is an active slug control system: the topside choke acts only if surges are observed, reducing the peak flow rate into the separator. Between slugs, the choke valve opens, reducing the imposed backpressure. Since flow fluctuations are reduced, operation is again possible without risking excessive separator liquid levels. The workflow consists of the following steps: (i) If slugging leads to production deferment or to operational problems, a feasibility study is done to assess the benefits of installing a Smart Choke. To this end, the key design and production data are collected in a single data sheet that is analyzed by flow assurance experts, (ii) The analysis may include using dynamic multiphase flow models. The models are used to reproduce the slugging behaviour as seen in the field and to assess the adequacy of the Smart Choke. (iii) If the results indicate a positive outlook, and the asset agrees, the implementation needs to be planned and executed. This requires further data gathering on the choke actuator, the pipework for a suitable transducer location, and the platform control system. (iv) The flow assurance and process control experts go to the platform to help commissioning the Smart Choke, which includes tuning of the controller parameters. (v) Once in operation the Smart Choke performance is monitored remotely by the experts using PI Process Book. In addition to pipeline systems already in operation, implementation of a Smart Choke can also be considered for pipeline projects in the development phase. When in the hydraulic assessment risks are identified with respect to slugging, the decision for full implementation can be postponed, but the production system is made "Smart Choke ready" by reservation of weight/space at a pipe segment at the outlet of the pipeline upstream of the separator. When slugging occurs in a later phase of the field life the spool piece can be replaced by the required Smart Choke hardware without doing any hot work.

AB  - Abstract Multiphase flow occurs in almost all producing oil and gas/condensate wells .Wellhead chokes are special equipment that widely used in the petroleum industry to control flow rate, to maintain well allowable, to protect surface equipments, to prevent water and gas coning and to provide the necessary backpressure to reservoir to avoid formation damage from excessive drawdown. Accurate modeling of choke performance and selection of optimum choke size is vitally important for a petroleum engineer in production from reservoirs due to high sensitivity of oil and gas production to choke size. Two main approaches have been proposed for prediction of multiphase flow through chokes can be classified as either analytical or empirical and majority of correlations were developed for critical flow conditions. Although most of the correlations available to petroleum engineers are for critical flow but in lots of high rate gas/condensate wells subcritical flow occurs in large choke sizes.There is no empirical correlation for wellhead choke performance under subcritical condition for high rate gas condensate wells, especially in large choke sizes. The first aim of this paper is to develop a new simple empirical Gilbert type correlation for high rate gas condensate wells under subcritical flow in large choke sizes (40/64 in. to 192/64 in.) using non-linear regression analysis based on 61 field data points of 15 wells from ten different fields. The second is to extend the work of Al-Attar for high rate gas condensate wells flowing through large choke size under subcritical flow conditions and check the applicability and advantages.Finally, statistical comparison between these two approaches is done with different error parameters. 1. Introduction Multiphase flow occurs in almost all producing oil and gas/condensate wells. Every flowing well has some devices to control the flow rate for maintaining sufficient back pressure to prevent formation damage, to protect surface equipments, to prevent water/gas coning, to stabilize the flow rate and to produce the reservoir at the most efficient possible rate. Thus chokes are one of the most important flow controllers in oil and gas producing wells. Accurate modeling of choke performance and selection of optimum choke size is vitally important for a petroleum engineer in production from reservoirs due to high sensitivity of oil and gas production to choke size. Flow through a surface choke can be described as either critical or sub-critical. Critical flow occurs when the velocity through the choke is greater than the sonic velocity of the fluid. This results in a Mach number of the fluid that is greater than or equal to one. For fluids with a velocity greater than sonic velocity, any downstream perturbation is unable to propagate upstream and the mass flow rate through the choke is solely a function of the upstream parameters, in other words, in a critical flow region, the mass flow rate reaches a maximum value that is independent of a pressure drop applied across the choke. Therefore, once critical flow is reached, any disturbance introduced downstream of the choke will have no effect on upstream conditions. Conversely, in sub-critical flow, the flow rate depends on pressure difference across the choke and changes in the downstream pressure affect the upstream pressure. Two main approaches have been proposed for prediction of multiphase flow through chokes can be classified as either analytical or empirical.The first investigation on gas-liquid two-phase flow through restrictions was performed by Tangren (1949). He presented an analysis of the behavior of an expanding gas-liquid system showing when gas bubbles are added to an incompressible fluid, above a critical flow velocity, the medium becomes incapable of transmitting pressure change upstream against the flow.

AB  - ABSTRACTA vortex choke valve is being developed to combat the erosive nature of wellhead flow. A spin off from research carried out for the British Nuclear industry, the valve uses a technology known as Power Fluidics and has no moving parts. The vortex choke valve makes use of the pressure drop generated by a spinning vortex flow to control the well fluid rather than the variable orifice found in conventional chokes. In this paper the development programme is reviewed and its implications for increased valve lifetimes and lower maintenance costs are discussed. INTRODUCTIONThe erosion damage suffered by conventional choke valves in wellhead flow control applications is a common problem. The basiccause is straightforward. High velocity particles of solid material impinge on the control surfaces of the valve causing degradation of control, or on downstream pipework causing qaterial loss which could lead ultimately to failure to atmosphere. Advances in choke technology have concentrated on providing hardened ceramic inserts for wear resistance and designing better flow paths for the well fluid. The rewards sought are to produce a longer choke life which in turn reduces maintenance costs and downtime. However, the fundamental method of providing the flow control and Pressure loss remains unchanged; a variable area orifice. The nuclear industry has similar pressures to those encountered in the petroleum industry. It too requires high reliability and long lifetimes from process equipment since maintenance is costly or sometimes impossible. This has led to the development of a technology known as Power Fluidics for use in nuclear processing plants. The philosophy of Power Fluidics is to provide control of liquids and gases without the use of moving parts in contact with the process fluid. This is achieved by using the properties of vortex flow, jet entrainment and other basic hydrodynamic forces to effect control. By having no moving parts and simple geometries, Power Fluidic devices are inherently reliable and maintenance free. One such device is the vortex valve. Originally developed to provide control of ventilation processes in nuclear plant, it uses the properties of vortex flow to provide a variable pressure drop. The concept of flow control is therefore radically different to conventional variable orifice techniques. This background vortex valve technology is now being developed for use as flow control chokes for the petroleum industry. The aim of the development programme is to fully explore the potential of the vortex choke valve to offer an improvement in the lifetime of chokes in erosive environments or to provide economic solutions to well control problems which cannot currently be addressed by conventional chokes, such as high pressure wells or deep water locations. This paper describes the vortex valve technology, the aims of the development programme and some of the results from the first two stages. Finally, the options for installation are discussed. First, a look at the basic vortex valve Technology.

AB  - This article, written by JPT Technology Editor Chris Carpenter, contains highlights of paper SPE 187190, “Choke Management Under Wellbore, Completion, and Reservoir Constraints,” by Emmanouil Karantinos, SPE, and Mukul M. Sharma, SPE, The University of Texas at Austin, prepared for the 2017 SPE Annual Technical Conference and Exhibition, San Antonio, Texas, USA, 9–11 October. The paper has not been peer reviewed. Choke-management strategies vary significantly among operators. No rigorous methodology exists for properly selecting choke sizes when constraints are placed on completions, wellbores, and fluid pressures and velocities. In this paper, the authors propose a coupled wellbore/reservoir model that performs dynamic nodal analysis using integrated models for surface-facilities, wellbore, and reservoir simulators and allows an operator to select choke sizes as a function of time. Introduction The suggested algorithm consists of three primary entities: the reservoir, the wellbore, and the completion. A reservoir simulator provides the rate as a function of drawdown or bottomhole pressure (BHP), and a wellbore model is used to calculate the frictional pressure loss along the wellbore and the surface flowlines. Depending on the fluid system, the appropriate choke-flow model is used. Dynamic (time-dependent) nodal analysis ensures the continuity of pressure and rates between the wellbore and reservoir entities at every timestep. The algorithm suggests the maximum available choke that satisfies, at all times, the entire set of user- specified constraints. The complete paper applies the method to two scenarios. The first is a high-permeability, vertical casedhole well in which screen erosion is a serious concern. For that particular case, the choke sizes should be adjusted to limit perforation velocities under the critical threshold of 10 ft/sec, which has been shown to cause screen erosion in high-permeability offshore wells. The authors show that choke sizing depends on various parameters, including the separator pressure, the well trajectory, and the true vertical depth. Finally, the method is applied to the design of a flowback operation in order to prevent proppant flowback and proppant crush-ing in a hydraulically fractured unconventional well. Design Considerations To mitigate the risk of productivity impairment or failures associated with the completion or other equipment, production engineers should take into consideration existing guidelines for allowable values of flow velocities or drawdown limits. These recommendations can be classified into three major categories: wellbore, completion, and reservoir constraints. Wellbore constraints include, but are not limited to, the maximum pressure drop across the choke to prevent hydrate or wax and asphaltene formation downstream of the choke, the maximum fluid velocity in the surface flowlines to prevent erosion, and the minimum fluid velocity along the wellbore trajectory to ensure effective proppant transport during flowback operations. Completion and reservoir constraints depend on the completion type in place. Table 1 of the complete paper presents several completion and reservoir constraints along with their maximum allowable values reported in the literature.

AB  - Abstract Sand erosion in oil and gas production units can present rigorous system and production design challenges. Erosion is a complex process that is affected by numerous factors such as the piping geometry, flow conditions, fluid properties and sand characteristics. Choke valves are used to control the flow in the production units and subject to significant sand erosion. At high differential pressure across the choke, flow accelerations may occur in the choke valve and result in extremely high flow and particle velocities (up to 500 m/s) within the choke valve and in the downstream pipes. Consequently, the erosion rates may become very high, which can effectively shorten the service life of choke valves. Therefore, the knowledge of the flow characteristics and the capability to predict erosion rates in choke valves is essential for determining the choke's service life and guaranteeing system integrity. The paper describes methods of using Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) for examining the choke valve fluid and particle flows as well as predicting the choke erosion. A 3D CFD choke flow simulation model is developed and validated against experimental data. The model is based on the Eulerian approach for simulating the flow while sand particles are tracked in the flow field using Lagrangian methodology and the erosion is predicted by implementing literature erosion correlations (TULSA and DNV) in the 3D CFD model.  The CFD flow and sand particle tracking simulations show excellent agreement between the predicted flow parameters and experimental data. Erosion hotspot locations are well predicted in the simulations while the erosion rates are underestimated. This discrepancy is caused by two main reasons. The first one is some numerical issues associated with extremely high velocities of the sand particles. The second one is that steady-state simulation neglects the geometry changes due to the erosion in the real test.  Current CFD tools can resolve the complex choke flows very well. Particle tracking accuracy depends on the particle size and sand loading. Erosion prediction accuracy is directly affected by the accuracy of the particle flow prediction and the applicability of the erosion correlation. Introduction Sand erosion in subsea components can cause serious design and production problems. Choke valves are especially affected by sand production and the resulting erosion due to the high fluid and sand particle velocities in the choke valves. Therefore, the knowledge of the flow characteristics and the capability to predict erosion rates in choke valves is essential for determining the choke's service life and guaranteeing system integrity. Physical laboratory erosion tests have been the base of the choke qualification and the characterization of the complex flow in the choke valves. However, the physical sand-erosion tests are extremely time consuming and costly. The development of validated 3D simulation tools can reduce the effort and lead time associated with the choke design verification and optimization as well as the choke qualification for a particular field application. Furthermore, the simulation models are also the base of erosion diagnostic and monitoring systems. Computational Fluid Dynamics for the flow and the particle tracking simulation, in conjunction with erosion models became an established tool to quantitatively predict the erosion distribution generated by sand flows in the last few years. Models are validated in (Zhang, Y, 2007), (Xianghui Chen, 2004), (Gary Brown, 2006), (Manickam, 1999), and (Graham, 2009).

AB  - AbstractSachdeva's choke flow model has been found capable of predicting critical-subcritical boundary and liquid and gas flow rates for multiphase crude systems. Although this model was shown to be accurate by Sachdeva et al. in their original paper using laboratory and field data, inaccuracy of the model has been found in other field applications. In this study, the accuracy of the choke model was evaluated using data from 239 oil wells and 273 gas condensate wells in Southwest Llouisiana. Comparisons of results from measurements and model calculations indicate that the model is more accurate for oil wells than for gas condensate wells. It was found that the error of the model could be minimized using different values of choke discharge coefficient (CD). For oil wells, CD = 1.08 should be used for liquid rate predictions, and CD = 0.78 should be used for gas rate predictions. For gas condensate wells, CD = 1.07 should be used for gas rate predictions, and CD = 1.53 should be used for liquid rate predictions. IntroductionWellhead chokes are equipment used in oil and gas industry to control fluid production rates from wells, to maintain stable pressure downstream from the choke, and to provide the necessary backpressure to a reservoir to avoid formation damage from excessive drawdown. Because oil and gas production rates are extremely sensitive to choke size, accurate modelling of choke performance is vitally important for petroleum engineers in oil production simulation. Tangren. 1 performed the first investigation on gasliquid two-phase flow through restrictions. He presented an analysis of the behavior of an expanding gas-liquid system. He showed that when gas bubbles are added to an incompressible fluid, above a critical flow velocity, the medium becomes incapable of transmitting pressure change upstream against the flow. Several empirical choke flow models have been developed in the past halfcentury. They generally take the following form for sonic flow: (equation (1) is available in full of paper). and C, m and n are empirical constants related to fluid properties. On the basis of the production data from Ten Section Field in California, Gilbert2 found the values for C, m and n to be 435, 0.546 and 1.89, respectively. Other values for the constants were proposed different researchers including Baxendell, 3 Ros, 4 and Achong. 5 Poettmann and Beck6 extended the work of Ros to develop charts for different API crude oils. Omana7 derived dimensionless choke correlations for water-gas systems. Fortunati8 was the first investigator who presented a model that can be used to calculate critical and subcritical two-phase flow through chokes. Ashford9 also developed a relation for two-phase critical flow based on the work of Ros. Gould10plotted the criticalsubcritical boundary defined by Ashford, showing that different values of the polytropic exponents yield different boundaries. Ashford and Pierce11 derived an equation to predict the critical pressure ratio. Their model assumes that the derivative of flow rate with respect to the downstream pressure is zero at critical conditions. One set of equations was recommended for both critical and subcritical flow conditions.

AB  - Abstract Mineral scale formation and deposition in down-hole completion equipment such as subsurface safety valves can cause dramatic and unacceptable safety risks and associated production losses and operational costs. Current scale removal strategies involve both mechanical and chemical technologies, each of them having their own advantages depending on the type of mineral scale and its location. However, these techniques are often costly and of limited efficiency. The current study assesses the ability of a range of chemically and morphologically modified coatings to prevent/reduce mineral scale surface fouling. Building-up on previous work done under static conditions, this paper presents results from scaling tests under laminar and turbulent dynamic conditions using a rotating cylinder electrode under in a complex (mixed) scaling environment (supersaturated w.r.t. calcium carbonate, barium sulfate, strontium sulfate, barium carbonate and strontium carbonate). The study shows that if properly selected, surface treatments represent a promising approach to reduce scale deposition on downhole equipment surfaces that are critical to maintain equipment functionality and thereby well safety barrier integrity. By analyzing the scaling behaviors observed within the set of surfaces tested, suggestions of the controlling factors in anti-fouling on these systems are presented and discussed.

AB  - The PDF file of this paper is in Russian. Tengizchevroil (TCO) has implemented Advanced Process Control (APC) to automatically control the feed into the plant by adjusting the chokes of selected wells in the field. The automated choke operations are closely monitored and thoroughly discussed during daily Field-Plant interface meetings to confirm overall stability of the plant performance and improvement in plant efficiency. With the use of a dynamic multivariable model-based controller we are now able to predict the demands from the production facility and automatically deliver the exact amount of field production to meet plant's ever-changing production capabilities while minimizing the pressure losses between the field and the operating plant. The early APC deployments demonstrated the opportunity in delivering highly significant value to TCO. TCO had implemented numerous APC throughout the plants to optimize complicated processes and developed the necessary organizational capability (OC) to implement the Field APC. The Field APC project was the first joint project involving both the field and the plant assets. This APC project demonstrated the "One TCO" approach, with support and buy in from a cross functional team of Automation, Reservoir Management, Process Engineering and Plant Operations personnel. TCO is now able to automatically react to changes in both the field and plant to deliver the maximum plant capacity at any given moment. Since plant throughput limitations are constantly changing due to changes in ambient temperature, H2S content or gas-oil ratio (GOR) of the inlet feed, etc.; the APC is automatically adjusting the output from the wells to match the inlet requirements of the plants. The solution uses dynamic models to predict constraints and drive operations to an economic optimum while honoring an everchanging set of constraints. The APC allows the plant and field operators to spend more time addressing non-routine problems by automating one of the operator's routine duties.

AB  - Abstract Drilling wells in depleted reservoirs is often characterised by a narrow operating window between formation pore pressure and fracture pressure. Drilling High Pressure High Temperature (HPHT) wells into a narrow margin reservoir is even more challenging, and Managed Pressure Drilling (MPD) techniques may be required in order to operate within safe limits. Managing the annular pressure profile during MPD operations requires a robust and reliable drilling control system. The presented work treats some challenges and possibilities regarding a MPD choke control system under evaluation for a planned HPHT well in the Kvitebjørn Field in the North Sea. Here pressure management is to be achieved by regulating the choke opening and thereby compensating for downhole pressure variations. Methodologies for automatic choke control during the drilling operation are assessed. A dynamic fluid flow model is used to calculate well pressures for application in the choke control algorithms, and to simulate pressure response in the well. The performance of choke control during drilling operations is evaluated and results from simulations are presented. Introduction Kvitebjørn is located in the Northern North Sea, southeast of Gullfaks. It is classified as a HPHT gas condensate field. The reservoir consists of sandstones in the Mid-Jurassic Brent group. The top of the reservoir (top of Tarbert) is at 4070 meters. Simultaneous drilling and production has brought pressure depletion, creating a convergence between pore pressure and fracture pressure in the reservoir. The initial pore pressure was 770 bar and fracture pressure was 875 bar. The temperature is 155 degrees, placing the reservoir in a borderline High Temperature category. Water depth is 190 metres. In total, 11 development wells are planned. So far seven wells have been completed (April 2006). Depletion is observed on Kvitebjørn, and for the last wells the narrow pressure window is expected to be a challenge. The depletion forecast indicates that a critical depth is expected to be at top of Tarbert. Managed Pressure Drilling (MPD) may be required to drill these wells. MPD in the HPHT environment has little precedence. This study was performed to examine the feasibility and potential application on Kvitebjørn. Simulations have been done for two theoretical wells representative for Kvitebjørn. Application of oil based mud (XP-07) and Cesium Formate (Cs/K Formate) has been considered in this study. The objectives of the feasibility study were to investigate the effects of the following three techniques: Automatic choke regulation, Continuous Circulation Device (CCD) and/or Mud heater These techniques can be combined or used separately. Application of a mud heater and/or CCD has primarily a stabilizing effect on the wellbore pressure profile, while automatic choke regulation is a direct and fast response technique that falls within the collective term of MPD. The scope for simulations at IRIS was: ECD o        During drilling o        Transients induced by pressure peaks from pump o        Effect of CCD Temperature effects o        Pump start-up after static period o        Drilling o        Effect of mud heater Tripping out Surge and swab Small kicks Kill pill Liner running Cementing operation Though all these aspects were simulated, the main focus was on drilling and pipe movements (surge, swab, tripping out) in the 8 1/2?? hole section.

AB  - Understanding the local behavior of sloshing pressure is essential for the design of LNG containment systems, particularly for operations in offshore environments. Extensive sloshing experiments have revealed that local pressures at temporal resolution on the order of 20 kHz and spatial resolution of 5 mm for scaled models up to 1:20 are stochastic; peak pressure varies dramatically from cycle to cycle even under a simple harmonic excitation in 1 degree of freedom. In addition, such pressures are strong functions of local geometry such as corrugations and raised invar edges, as well as physical and thermal conditions of the ullage. As such, the phenomenon is very challenging for predictions using existing numerical algorithms. To obtain proper design values for the containment system, scaled model tests must address the above parameters and appropriate scaling laws must be identified. In this paper, we assimilate fundamental aspects of sloshing from first principles to identify relevant dimensionless numbers necessary for the dynamic similarity of scaled model tests involving local pressures. Various experiments were carried out to support the relevance of such dimensionless numbers; this paper discusses experimental results and their implication in scaling. INTRODUCTIONImpulsive loads that resulted from body entry into fluids have been extensively studied from the turn of the 20th century. von Kármán (1929) and Wagner (1932) employed potential flow theory to study the 2-D cylinder and wedge entry problem, respectively, by neglecting the effects of gravity. (Fluid acceleration during impact is much larger than that of gravity). The potential function was assumed to be Φ = 0 at the mean free surface z = 0. This condition was subsequently relaxed by many in vestigators, noticeably Zhao and Faltinsen (1993) and Zhang, Yue and Tanizawa (1996). Solutions obtained from these techniques are deterministic, i.e. the same initial and boundary conditions always lead to the same solutions.

AB  - AbstractA problem in mature oil fields is the large amount of water produced alongside the oil. At the moment that both phases are leaving the wellbore of an oil well, tight water-in-oil emulsions can be formed due to the turbulence in the choke-valve at the wellhead. This flow process was simulated in the laboratory, by pumping crude oil-brine mixtures through a model choke-valve represented by a calibrated orifice. The parameters varied were the water-cut, the production flow rate and the orifice dimensions. The water-in-oil emulsion droplets were encapsulated immediately after formation and the emulsion characteristics, i.e. droplet-size distributions and water fraction were determined by optical microscopy and DSC.The results of the experiments revealed that water-in-oil emulsions could be formed in the choke-valve if a certain critical value of the average energy dissipation rate was exceeded. This critical value depends on the type of crude oil and on the oil-water ratio. The diameter of the emulsion droplets found in the experiments could be explained in the framework of inertial and viscous break-up theories. In experiments with a crude oil with little asphaltenes the droplet diameters were in the order of the Kolmogorov length scale and the average diameter Dav of the emulsion droplets decreased with increasing energy dissipation rate ( following a power-law relation: Dav?en. The value of the exponent n was found to be -0.3 and -0.1 at a watercut of 30 vol.% and 50 vol.% respectively. In experiments with an asphaltenic crude oil, the final droplet diameter was determined by viscous forces, probably due to relaminarising flow conditions. This paper gives new information with respect to the characteristics of brine-in-crude-oil emulsions being formed in a model choke-valve and can be used to obtain insight in the emulsion formation problematic at the wellhead of an oil well. Additionally, the paper provides data on the size of droplets formed in turbulent and laminar flow at high dispersed-phase fraction.IntroductionA choke-valve that is positioned at the wellhead of an oil well is used to control the production flow rate and to reduce the pressure in the tubing to a value which is favourable for further processing of the produced fluids. The ‘choking' of the production flow in the choke-valve implies the conversion of a part of the kinetic energy of the flow into heat by viscous dissipation. The flow regime in the choke-valve is generally completely turbulent. The turbulence phenomenon can be regarded as a collection of a large number of rotating fluid structures (‘eddies') of different dimensions. These eddies will inevitably have a mixing effect and a stable emulsion can be formed if two immiscible fluid phases are present. The stability of the formed emulsion is primary determined by the droplet diameter and the chemical components present at the droplet interface, such as asphaltenes and resins which are considered as the natural surfactants of crude oils. The break-up of oil droplets in water during flow through an orifice has been studied extensively by van der Zande1. In his experiments he has measured the droplet size of oil droplets leaving from an orifice (figure 1) as a function of pressure drop, orifice dimensions, oil viscosity and diameter of the arriving oil droplets. His experiments were performed with a mineral oil-tap water system at very low dispersed phase fraction (<1 vol.% oil), to exclude the influence of surfactants and droplet coalescence on the break-up process respectively. For low oil viscosity, the droplet diameters measured by van der Zande1 were found to be equal to the values predicted by the droplet break-up theory of Hinze2.

AB  - Abstract Hydraulic fracture conductivity losses because of proppant embedment, proppant failure and rock damage by nonnative fluid interactions are the leading cause of drops in well productivity. These conductivity losses are strongly governed by the local stress regime in the vicinity of the fracture face and the geomechanical responses of the rock to these stresses. Drawdown management for shale wells seeks to minimize fracture conductivity losses and matrix permeability impairment in order to create conditions for favorable long-term well performance. This is achieved by controlling drawdown to manage near-wellbore and near-fracture stresses to avoid or mitigate proppant embedment and sharp fracture conductivity decline. However, these approaches may also lead to poor initial production trends. This work focuses on the use of a coupled geomechanical and reservoir flow model for optimizing choke or drawdown management to maximize NPV for liquids-rich shale wells. Geologic analysis, reservoir and fluid properties and completion-related properties acquired from a prominent liquids-rich shale play within the continental US forms the basis of our study. Three different stress sensitive models are used as a proxy for soft, medium and stiff rocks to simulate different degrees of irreversible rock deformation. The geomechanical model considers the effects of hysteresis and choke management strategies developed for a diverse set of rock mechanical properties. The Productivity Index (PI) along with the cumulative rates are used to evaluate the effectiveness of any chosen choke management strategy. Our results indicate that the most critical time period for optimizing long-term well management is during the initial life of the well. High production rates with sharp declines, typical of shale reservoirs, causes irreversible damage in the vicinity of the fracture affecting its conductivity. Choking back the wells in anticipation of longer term stable production profiles is also shown to be less than optimal. We compare and contrast several different drawdown settings and demonstrate that the choice of a larger choke setting during the initial life of the well coincides with the highest possible NPV and recovery factors over a wide range of reservoir and fluid properties. Our results also indicate that irrespective of the choice of drawdown setting, the losses in fracture conductivity and matrix permeability tend to be very severe in the first few days of production.

AB  - Summary The most important contributor to improved oil recovery on mature fields is drilling of infill wells. Managed-pressure drilling (MPD) and continuous-circulation-system (CCS) techniques can be used for improved control of bottomhole pressure when drilling wells in depleted fields with narrow pressure windows, but rig heave is a challenge when drilling from floating drilling units. Rig heave, caused by sea waves, induces downhole pressure oscillations that could exceed the operational pressure window. These oscillations are called “surge and swab,” and occur during tripping in and tripping out of the borehole, as well as during drillpipe connections, while the drillstring is suspended in the slips. Downhole choking was introduced as a method to reduce downhole pressure oscillations induced by the rig heave, and the concept was tested at laboratory scale and using computer simulations (Kvernland et al. 2018). The simulations were performed using a purpose-developed software that uses such input variables as wave height, pump flow, drillpipe movements, rig characteristics, and drilling-fluid properties, along with well design, drillpipe, and bottomhole-assembly (BHA) data, to simulate downhole pressure induced by rig heave. The simulator is designed to model dynamic interactions between the drilling fluid and the drillstring in a rigorous manner, which gives it the ability to accurately predict rapid downhole changes, such as those induced by ocean waves. In this paper, we provide an overview of the surge-and-swab simulator, describing its capabilities and limitations. Data from drilling a North Sea well are then used to validate the simulations performed using the software. The well used as an example in this paper was drilled conventionally from a floating rig. The downhole pressure variations recorded during three different drillpipe connections are compared with simulated downhole pressure. The simulations are performed on the basis of the recorded rig heave as well as the actual drilling-fluid, well-design, and drillpipe data. Results show that there is a good correlation between simulated and actual measured downhole pressure. The surge-and-swab simulation software is then used to simulate the same drillpipe connections using three different techniques and combinations of techniques used for improved downhole pressure control: (1) MPD, (2) MPD combined with CCS, and (3) MPD combined with CCS and a downhole choke. Results show that rig heave-induced downhole pressure variations are reduced to a level that is considered acceptable for drilling a well with a narrow pressure window for the last two cases, whereas use of backpressure MPD alone is not sufficient. The combination of MPD and CCS reduced surge and swab for two out of three drillpipe connections. For the third and deepest connection, the surge-and-swab pressure increased. The largest reduction in significant downhole pressure variations occurs when MPD and CCS are combined with downhole choking. Future work will consist of further developing the surge-and-swab simulator so that it will be possible to use it in well planning and as real-time decision support during drilling operations. The simulator will also be developed to include the possibility of simulating various well completion operations such as running casing and liners. The next hardware development phase consists of designing and building a complete downhole tool for testing in a well.

AB  - Abstract The flowback period of the unconventional wells is very critical as it can cause determential ecomonical effects if not properly optimized. The success of the well is as dependent of the completion program as it is from the flowback program applied during the initial production period of the well. If ineffective operations are performed on the flowback phase {independently on the completion technology}, the well can underperform and become unsuitable for development. In unconventional wells, it is necessary to develop the safe well operating envelope in safe zone to prevent the early proppant flowback based on the reservoir parameters and the completions in place. The well can start producing in this developed safe well operating envelope by controlling the wellhead pressure and surface valves and optimizing the proper choke size to keep the well with free proppant production. Proppant flowback production modeling captured decline of water production as well as the increase of liquid production when a selected choke sizes is applied. By controlling the flowing bottomhole pressure (FBHP) during defined flowback period, the volume of proppant production decreased with decreasing chokes sizes and increasing long flowback periods. This study showed that the optimized choke sizes to improve the longer production periods depended on the sensitivity of pressure drawdown, liquid rates, wellhead pressure, and fracture geometry parameters. Numerical results showed that the critical parameters affecting the stability of the proppant pack are fracture closure pressure, reservoir pressure, proppant type and size, and type of fracturing fluid. Proppant flowback program developed by using optimized choke size, wellhead pressure (WHP) and FBHP, and amount of producible proppant volume predicted for designed flowback production periods. At the beginning of the flowback period, the wellbore is filled with fracturing fluid and the minimum choke size should be used as small as possible (12/64"). The controlled FBHP management over 45 days of flowback period corresponds to an average drawdown rate of 10 psi/day to 200 psi/day. Finally, the developed workflow applied to design flowback periods and selection of choke sizes to prevent excessive proppant production and proppant crushing in hydraulically fractured unconventional wells. This paper presents the methodology and workflow for selecting the required choke sizes and flowback periods to minimize the risk of production of high volume proppant during the flowback period after fracturing. The case study presented here in will present the benefits of optimizing choke sizes and flowback programs for reducing the damage to fracture conductivity and to increase the cumulative production. The optimized choke sizes, flowback strategies and workflow established with this case study have proven to increase the performance of fractured unconventional wells.

AB  - Abstract The control line for CZ-5 well became plugged due to contaminants in the hydraulic control line fluid. As a result, CZ-5 well remained shut in with the deferment of 2000 bbls/day. Remedial solution was planned and it involved the installation of subsurface controlled safety valve or storm choke. Since the failed subsurface safety valve is in the jammed close position, the mechanism to lock open the flapper and to keep the valve open permanently must be done before the installion of the storm choke. The special tubing with smaller ID, or better known as straddle, was then set across the flapper and hang inside. Without the realization that the pressure setting of the storm choke calculation would become complicated with the smaller tubing/straddle inside, the closing and opening pressure were determined based on NODAL Analysis. The flapper of CZ-5 ScSSV was also expected to dislocate severely and a special flip open tool is designed to position the dislocated flapper back to its housing. Flapper flip open tool is the in-house designed tool that can be run using slickline for 2 7/8?, 3½? or 4½? tubing. This unique tool has enabled many lock open jobs in our operation and it has totally eliminated the need for flapper milling. The unexpected outcome of valve closing pressure and operating speed was experienced for a few times after the installation, causing the multiple intervention work to retrieve and to re-set the storm choke with different setting pressure. Though all minimum data required to design the storm choke for CZ-5 has been rightly considered, its performance is still very unpredictable and shocking. Determined to make the valve to work properly for a desired certain period of time, all operational data were gathered and studied. During the last rectification attempt, the storm choke has finally worked as intended. The paper will describe more on the challenges encountered during the set-up of flip open tool and modified straddle, the engineering design of both of them and the storm choke unique behaviour from the experience at Caspian Sea Operation.

AB  - ABSTRACTCalcium carbonate (CaCO3) is the predominate type of mineral scale formed in many industrial water processes including oil and gas production. Comprehensive and accurate knowledge on the CaCO3 scaling mechanism is critical for the effective scale management. Extensive studies have been carried out on CaCO3 formation process and prevention under various conditions of temperature, saturation state, pH and additives. The effect of pressure is considered in scaling tendency calculation, but its potential impact on scaling kinetics has been neglected.This paper presents the laboratory results of CaCO3 scaling kinetics at various pressures (500-5000 psi) and temperatures (80-150°C). Tests were conducted with a dynamic tube blocking apparatus which measures CaCO3 scale buildup by monitoring hydrostatic pressure differential (∆P) across a capillary tubing, and the period of time for increase in ∆P to reach 1 psi was determined. Test waters were maintained at similar CaCO3 supersaturation level at different temperature and pressure combinations by adjusting bicarbonate alkalinity. Results show that, under the test conditions, scaling process was accelerated by both temperature and pressure. CaCO3 scaling time was shortened by ∼35% at 80°C and > 60% at 150°C when pressure was increased from 500 psi to 5000 psi. By increasing temperature from 80°C to 150°C, scaling time was reduced ∼45% at 1500 psi and > 50% at 3000 psi.This study provides new understanding on the mineral scaling kinetics by identifying the pressure dependence of CaCO3 scale formation process. Experimental results show that pressure, other than its impact on solubility, has additional kinetic effect on CaCO3 scaling rate.INTRODUCTIONCalcium carbonate (CaCO3) is the major scale component in many systems, which produce, transport and use water, largely due to relatively high concentrations of dissolved calcium and carbonate alkalinity in natural waters. With changes in temperature, pressure or chemical composition, water becomes supersaturated with respect to CaCO3, which can result in scale deposition on equipment surface. Scale can restrict fluid flow, decreases heat transfer, and cause premature failure of equipment.1,2 Effective scale control is essential for the efficient and safe operation in many industrial processes.

AB  - Abstract Erosion, a common cause of failure in oilfield equipment, remains a complex phenomenon despite extensive studies by the industry. The severity of erosion depends on a multitude of factors such as fluid properties, flow rate, sand size and rate, material type, geometry as well as many others. Knowledge of the erosion rate is useful in determining the service life for a piece of equipment exposed to a given set of operating conditions. A combination of experimental results and Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) can optimize product performance at the design level. This paper presents a set of curves that will estimate erosion of different components of the choke as a function of choke position and flow rate derived from use of CFD. Plots of the erosion results in terms of thickness loss per time in units of mils/year are provided for each component for varying flow rates and sand volume concentrations. Results from the study show that the erosion rates increase in a quadratic fashion with respect to the flow rate. Introduction Solid particle erosion is a concern in any application involved with the motion of solid particles in a carrier fluid. The areas most susceptible to erosion are those located near changes in flow direction. In these areas, the particles are most likely to deviate from the flow streamlines and impinge the surface of the geometry. The severity of erosion depends on a multitude of factors such as fluid properties, flow rate, sand size and rate, material type, geometry as well as many others.1 However, trying to isolate the effect of a single factor and extrapolate the findings to a wide range of conditions is difficult. Currently, consensus has not even been reached as to which factors should be given primary consideration, investigated or included in an erosion model. The numerous variables affecting erosion and lack of understanding of the effect of these variables makes erosion reduction extremely difficult. Approach/Methodology Knowledge of the erosion rate is useful in determining the service life for a piece of equipment exposed to a given set of operating conditions. There are two primary methods to study erosion: experimentation and computer simulation. Experimental testing is often difficult to perform for conditions of interest. For example, the actual operating conditions may be for large flow rates or at pressures that are difficult to achieve experimentally. Additionally if the erosivity is low then it may not be possible to achieve measurable erosion in a reasonable amount of time. The most state-of-the-art erosion prediction tool takes advantage of computational fluid dynamics (CFD) simulations. This approach has four main steps: geometry creation, flow simulation, particle tracking, and applying erosion equations. If experiments can not be performed for conditions of interest, it is advisable to use a combination of experimentation and computational fluid dynamics techniques. First experimental results can be obtained for conditions as close to the conditions of interest as possible. Then computational fluid dynamics can be used to obtain results for the conditions of interest by scaling the experimental results. CFD simulations are performed for the experimental conditions and the results of the simulation are compared to the experimental results. The difference between the experimental data and predicted results provides the scaling factor to be applied to the simulations at the conditions of interest. This study was divided into two phases. The objective of Phase I of the study was to determine the most representative way to perform the simulations and to tune the erosion equations being applied to each component by obtaining a scaling factor for each by comparing predicted results to experimental results. The goal of Phase II was to apply the CFD erosion prediction approach for the operating conditions of interest and adjust the predicted results using the scaling factors. The results of Phase II are in turn used to develop the curves for erosion as a function of choke position and flow rate.

AB  - ABSTRACTErosion-corrosion is a complex phenomenon that depends on complex factors such as fluid characteristics, flow regime, flow geometry, aqueous chemistry, temperature, and type of metal. Flow modeling and particle tracking are important tools for predicting erosion-corrosion. In erosion and corrosion modeling it is important to account not only for the factors that influence erosion-corrosion but also for changes in some of these factors that occur as the erosion-corrosion process continues. For example, the change in the geometry resulting can have a significant impact on the erosion results. Geometiy changes result when corners, found in couplings and chokes, are eroded with time. This change in geometry due to erosion can drastically change the flow solution, especially the turbulent kinetic energy and dissipation rate. Recognizing this change is imperative, since the prediction of particle behavior is heavily dependent on the turbulent kinetic energy. Furthermore, more particle impingements occur in regions with higher turbulent kinetic energy. This paper shows that neglecting the change in the flow filed solution resulting from the change in geometry can cause erroneous erosion predictions. A study was performed on a choke geometry to demonstrate the importance of incorporating the change in geometry resulting from erosion. The turbulent kinetic energy contours are presented as a function of the changing choke geometry. The predicted erosion rates along the choke are also examined for the various scenarios, and these results are compared to experimental results. Results from this study show that it is necessary to update the flow geometry and flow model based on the changing geometry due to erosion or erosion-corrosion. INTRODUCTIONProduction facilities are often faced with erosion and erosion-corrosion damage in pipes, fittings, and chokes. ?II-E resulting damage is especially sever when solid particles such as sand are present in the produced fluid. The sand impinges the surface of the various components removing small quantities of material. This material can be the base metal of the component or the protective corrosion scales forming on the walls. The latter results in a complex synergistic effect between erosion and corrosion that has been discussed by Shadley et al. 1 Many fittings such as elbows and tees redirect the flow and often the particles? momentum carry them across the flow to impinge the fitting wall. In this paper, this will be referred to as direct impingement. However, particles also can cause erosion in straight pipes or geometries that contain a straight section of pipe such as chokes. In these cases, particles obtain a velocity component normal to the wall from turbulent fluctuations in the flow. The impingements resulting from turbulent fluctuations will be referred to as random impingements, since the turbulent nature of the flow is a random process. Production companies would like to be able to predict erosion and erosion-corrosion damage resulting from sand in specific pipe fittings and configurations as well as straight pipes for certain operating conditions. This would enable designers and operators to predict service life of specific components, have a tool to implement in design procedures for the construction of new facilities, or estimate extent of damage and remaining life of components for different operating conditions. The erosion process alone is complex and many factors affect the severity of erosion. One method used to study the erosion process is to perform numerous experimental studies. Performing experiments for cases of interest to production situations is difficult for several reasons including elevated pressure and temperatures as

AB  - Abstract An electric choke can be an essential component of a subsea system and could represent the next major leap in subsea innovation. This paper presents the added functionality that an electric choke can bring to a subsea system during production startups and shutdowns as well as how it can improve condition monitoring and downhole instrumentation protection. The electric choke can be easily integrated to a hydraulic or electric control system. It is driven by a motor and does not require stepping, therefore enabling greater control and precision. A comparison is presented between typical operations of a field using a traditional hydraulic choke versus an electric choke. We will also look at some of the additional benefits an infinite number of positions can bring to the system for production and injection field operations. Electrically actuated chokes provide several advantages during production startup and shutdown. An unlimited number of precise positionings means that wells can be brought onstream and shut down gradually to prevent formation damage. For monitoring purposes, there is an improved response time in diagnostics and interpretation of measurements coming from the downhole valves, sensors, wellhead, and subsea instrumentation. This improved response and additional information, including actuator motor power consumption, actuator motor speed, and valve and choke position, enable better condition monitoring, and through predictive analytics, uptime can be optimized and interventions can be reduced. In long-offset fields, electrically actuated chokes provide protection of downhole equipment, such as surface-controlled subsea safety valves (SCSSVs) and downhole screens. Electric subsea production control systems have been around since the late 1990s. Because of the recent economic climate, the industry is now looking for more effective ways to produce hydrocarbons, and removing hydraulics from the system seems to be a cost-effective and technically feasible solution. Electrically actuating chokes provides great benefits and opens the door for fully electric systems in the future.

AB  - AbstractBarium sulphate scaling during waterflooding causes formation damage mostly near to production wells, because high velocity near to wellbore provokes intensive mixing and accelerated chemical reaction between barium and sulphate ions.The mathematical model for steady state oil-water flow towards producers accounting for chemical reaction is developed, and an analytical solution is found. It allows obtaining a productivity index formula for PI decline prediction.The main result of the work is proportionality between the inverse to productivity index and time.IntroductionBarium and strontium sulphate scaling is a chronicle disaster during offshore waterflood project where injected and formation waters are incompatible, and their mixing causes salt precipitation1,2. Oilfield scaling prediction and prevention requires description and classification of mixing-precipitation-formation damage scenario. The detailed description of barium sulphate scaling in different reservoir zones and the consequent formation damage has been presented in paper1.The injection and formation water mixing happens throughout the reservoir swept zone during water flooding. So, in case of barium containing formation water and sulphate containing injection water, barium sulphate precipitates all over the swept zone1,2.The mixture zone moves along with displaced oil and injection water from injection wells towards producers, and barium sulphate precipitation takes place inside the mixture zone. The precipitant accumulation does not happen due to mixture zone movement, and the amount precipitated in a reservoir point during the mixture zone passing via this point, does not cause significant permeability reduction.The precipitant can accumulate on the boundaries of layers/zones with contrast permeabilities, permeability decrease can be significant, but these boundaries are usually parallel to flow direction, so precipitant does not form a flow barrier.Paper1 discusses in details why the barium sulphate makes formation damage just in near well regions, and why it does not cause a significant permeability damage outside the near-well area.Diffusion increases near to production wells due to velocity increase3, so an intensive mixing happens near to well. Also, velocity increase causes the chemical kinetics rate increase4,5. Therefore, precipitation near to wellbore happens more intensively than in a reservoir. Furthermore, the significant part of the precipitant accumulates in well vicinity and causes the permeability reduction.So, chemical reaction between barium and sulphate happens all over the reservoir swept zone, but it causes formation damage only near to production wells1.In the current paper, flow of oil along with formation and injected waters towards producer accounting for chemical reaction and solid precipitation is discussed. The effect of proportionality of the chemical reaction rate constant to flow velocity4,5 have been incorporated into the model. An analytical model developed allows deriving formula for productivity index decline due to barium sulphate scaling.It was shown that deposition profiles around the well are always non-monotonic. Two different precipitation regimes with deposition near and far away from well have been observed.The main result of the work is the proportionality between the inverse to productivity index (impedance) and time. The impedance increase is proportional to the product of formation damage coefficient and chemical kinetics coefficient. It allows determination of the chemical kinetics coefficient under the reservoir conditions from well production history.

AB  - Abstract There is an ongoing debate in the industry regarding the use of ICD (inflow control devices) in wells with scale potential. Several concepts for ICD in sand screen completions were evaluated for the Heidrun field, and the equipment chosen had a robust design of the housing, into which the flow goes before entering the basepipe through the nozzles. Oil field scale is an increasing challenge on the Norwegian continental shelf. One reason for this is the wide use of seawater for reservoir pressure support. Seawater contains sulphate, and mixing of such with barium and strontium containing formation water forms the basis for precipitation of low soluble sulphate salts. In commingled producers mixing of incompatible waters from different reservoir zones can occur due to seawater being flooded through high permeable zones. The most critical places for scale deposition are the screen section and the DHSV (downhole safety valve). Deposition in the screens hinders inflow to the well and reduces the well productivity. Recently collected production log data from an ICD completed well with sulphate scale potential forms an important basis for the evaluation of this novel completion solution. The well is a horizontal oil producer completed with 5 1/2?? ICD standalone sand screen in 8 1/2?? open hole. There are three inflow zones divided by swell packers in blank sections to avoid annular communication. Scale deposits present in the well seem to precipitate around the ICD nozzles inside the tubing, as seen from both GR (gamma ray) and x-y caliper data. Scale deposited in the middle zone does not disappear during the course of multiple logging passes in the well, while the deposits in the upper zone are clearly reduced. This indicates different precipitation processes for the two zones. Introduction The Heidrun field is located on Haltenbanken in the Norwegian Sea about 175 km from the shore. The production started in October 1995. The field development concists of a tension leg plattform with 56 well slots. There are two tie-in subsea production templates and three subsea injection templates. The main production challenges are sand and fines production and mineral scaling.  Since the reservoir is close to hydrostatic pressure the wells are equipped with gas lift for artificial lifting. Water flooding is the major drive mechanism for pressure support and drainage of the reservoir. All produced water is reinjected to the reservoir. In addition there is injection of seawater and SRP water (sulphate reduced seawater). Seawater has caused tremendous problems for the drainage in some reservoir segments due to formation of barium sulphate (BaSO4) scale in the producers. The problems associated with this are shut-in and corresponding workover of wells which fail on inflow tests on DHSV. Reduced well productivity from scaling in the near wellbore region is also a problem. As a consequence, SRP water is now replacing raw seawater in new injectors.

AB  - AbstractAccelerated production, increased ultimate recovery, and reduced interventions are goals of any operating company. It is now possible to attain all of these goals simultaneously by retrofitting intelligent well technology to an existing, conventional completion. This task is much more complex when the new technology must be installed in conjunction with artificial lift, such as an electric submersible pump (ESP). However, new technology and procedures have overcome this complexity and offer a viable option for optimizing production in existing completions that use artificial lift. Commingled or selective production from two or more zones is an ideal method of accelerating production from a single well. Traditional designs require interventions into the well to select the intervals to be produced. In most ESP wells, commingling is achieved by using "Y" blocks which allow production tubing to be run from the tubing hanger to the zones of interest. The ESP must then be downsized to accommodate this side-string, which significantly reduces available pump horsepower. This paper focuses on single-ESP wells producing from multiple pay zones. Various application patterns for use of intelligent well technology beneath ESPs are presented, especially focusing on immediate and future benefits. Theoretical examples are presented to illustrate how intelligent completions can enhance the ESP performance, add flexibility, and extend the range of application for a given pump.IntroductionIntelligent well technology has become an important part of oil and gas recovery. At the time intelligent wells were conceived in the industry, it was considered that intelligent completions would be mostly used in high-end wells, like subsea and deepwater installations, where the high cost of intervention made conventional completions uneconomical. Application of this technology has continued to expand since recent installation results have demonstrated the value of these completions with a high success rate.ESP systems are often used in older reservoirs on wells with relatively high water cuts. ESP provides cost-effective production by lifting fluid production from these less efficient, mature reservoirs. Successful ESP production depends on operating within an optimum operating range of the selected pump. Due to changes in the formation over time, the ESP may not be able to stay within the desired operating range of the pump and its efficiency may drop to an unacceptable level.Remote controlled open/close devices are mature, reliable and relatively inexpensive. They afford many cost-effective applications when used in combination with artificial lift technology. Moreover, a user of ESPs has already committed to running electric lines and protectors along the completion. Adding a few more lines to accommodate intelligent completions is a small incremental cost. This creates the combination of challenge and potential for value creation that results in economical advantage through leverage of intelligent well technology. There are several template application patterns that support usage of intelligent wells under ESPs. A more specific field application has been reported in a previous publication.[1]The objective of this paper is to provide theoretical strategies for optimizing ESP performance by using downhole chokes in a well producing from multiple zones. We first present a mathematical model for a single zone case that is extended to multi-zone applications. Using the model, we also present a comparative example for different completion patterns and discuss the benefit of each application. The infinite variable or multi-position chokes can add more flexibility, improve ESP operating efficiency, and thus extend the life of a given pump, which reduces the operating costs and improves the productivity and recovery factors of a well.

AB  - SummaryThree types of reservoir description models have been developed for Balmoralfield, North Sea, for different applications. A depositional model provides ageological basis for constructing a layer model and for exploration for similardeposits. The layer model provides a framework for calculating reservoirvolumetrics. A flow-unit model integrates geological and petrophysicalproperties, thus providing the most properties, thus providing the mostcomprehensive description for simulation and reservoir management.IntroductionAs a result of the increased interaction between geologists and engineers inresolving reservoir problems, geologists have become more aware of the need tovary the scale and style of geologic description according to particularengineering applications. particular engineering applications. Conventionalgeological descriptions normally are too detailed for reservoir engineeringsimulations and often are not in an appropriate format for relating toreservoir performance. A geological reservoir description of Balmoral field,North Sea, is presented here as an example of different scales and styles ofreservoir description for different applications. This study had threeobjectives: (1) to develop a depositional model that would provide the basisfor a layer model and for provide the basis for a layer model and for anexploration model for similar tertiary deposits in the North Sea, (2) todevelop a geologically based layer model to provide the framework forcalculating reservoir volumetrics, and (3) to develop a flow-unit model thatcombines geologic and petrophysical properties to describe the reservoirpetrophysical properties to describe the reservoir more comprehensively forreservoir management purposes.Balmoral field, discovered by Sun Oil Co. in 1975, is located in the U.K.North Sea Block 16/21 a-b, 140 miles [225 km] off the northeast coast ofScotland (Fig. 1). Production from the field began in 1987 from a Productionfrom the field began in 1987 from a single floating production vessel. Thefield produces from Paleocene sands at an produces from Paleocene sands at anaverage subsea depth of 6,970 ft [2124 m] in water depths averaging 470 ft [143m]. The field is a 6 x 2-mile [9.7 x 3.2-km], northwest-trending, low-reliefanticline cut by a number of faults, trending predominantly northwest, with asecondary set trending northeast to east (Fig. 2). The approximate oil/watercontact (OWC) is at 7,050 ft [2149 m] subsea.Geologic SettingThe Balmoral field is located on the southern tip of the Fladen Ground Spur,a southerly extension of the East Shetland Platform, North Sea. The FladenGround Platform, North Sea. The Fladen Ground Spur was a positive featurethroughout the basins of the Witch Ground graben in the west from the SouthViking graben in the east.Thick Mesozoic sediments present in the flanking grabens are absent on theFladen Ground Spur. It was not until the Late Cretaceous Age that the FladenGround Spur began to subside with the surrounding areas, although it stillremained a relatively positive feature. From the end of the Paleocene positivefeature. From the end of the Paleocene Age to the present, the area of theBalmoral field subsided along with the rest of the North Sea and was filledwith clastics from the bordering massifs. During the Paleocene Age, theShetland Platform to the northwest was uplifted and tilted eastward, givingrise to an easterly directed drainage pattern. Consequently, Late Paleocene andyounger clastic sediments in the area are composed of deltaic, shelf, andsubmarine fan deposits that are thought to have been derived from the Scottishlandmass to the west and northwest.Depositional ModelLithologies and Vertical Stratification Sequences. Of the 25 wells in thefield, 19 were cored. These cores were examined for sedimentologiccharacteristics, described below.Almost all the reservoir interval is composed of fine- to medium-grained,moderately to poorly sorted sand. Individual sand beds are typically massiveand unconsolidated except for occasional zones cemented with calcite. Dishstructures and vertical fluid-escape pipes are sometimes preserved within thecalcite-cemented zones. Many beds are probably amalgamated with sharp, erosivebases; however, these are usually not visible owing to the unconsolidatednature of the sand and, quite often, to heavy oil-staining.The calcite-cemented -zones are up to a few feet thick in cores. These zonesappear on sonic logs as high-velocity zones or spikes; thus their presence canbe determined in uncored portions of wells, allowing correlation between wells(Fig. 3). Many of the zones can be correlated across several wells, while otherzones occur within a particular stratigraphic interval in only one particularstratigraphic interval in only one well.JPTP. 202

AB  - AbstractIn this paper we describe a case history of a raging battle against scale deposition in the production system of Tinggi oil field in offshore Terengganu, Malaysia. This field experienced a sharp production decline from 1995 to 1997 at a rate of 26% per year. Scale deposition in various parts of the production system together with sand and emulsion caused widespread equipment/instruments failure, valves/chokes malfunction and most importantly severe piping restrictions at various points of the entire production system, surface and subsurface. A facilities capacity review study was conducted in order to differentiate between real facilities bottlenecks and scaled up restrictions. Pin pointing all the scaled up bottlenecks was quite a challenge. Diagnosis methods included visual inspection, pressure drop comparison, temperature sensing and gamma ray scanning. All scaled up points were successfully detected and cleaned up. As a result of this work together with sand, emulsion control and other production optimization efforts, oil production started to pick up by mid 1998. Production increased by 64% within a year with a total gain of 3.7 MSTB/d.A comprehensive scale management plan was put together, both short term and long term. Routine scale cleanup, identification of scale-prone source reservoir and its management, scale inhibitor chemical injection program, routine stroking of control valves, scale buildup monitoring program of surface flowlines are some of the short term measures taken. Amongst long term measures, a study of effectiveness of Magnetic Fluid Conditioners (MFC) has been initiated. One commercial magnetic tool has been tried so far, with no benefit observed. While long term study continues, short term measures have brought the situation completely under control.IntroductionTinggi field is part of the PM-9 block, located in the south-eastern part of the Malay Basin, approximately 280 kilometers offshore east of Kerteh, Terengganu, Malaysia (Fig.1). This field was developed during August 1982 to March 1984. Tinggi reservoirs (J & K) produce under a combination of natural water drive and gas re-injection (in upper J only) at the crest of the small gas cap. About 92% of their UR (123.0 MMSTB) has been depleted with current WC of 85% and GOR 900 scf/STB. Scale Deposition ProblemTinggi production peaked at around 40 MSTB/d in 1989 (Fig.2). Then as the field water cut started to increase, signs of scale deposition on surface facilities piping started to become visible. Sand production and emulsion problem also started to surface. Gradually several wellhead flowlines and downhole tubing started to experience scale deposition resulting in flow restrictions and well accessibility problems. Wellservices work started to become more and more difficult as accessing some of the wells required tubing clearance using mechanical scratching and/or chemical (acid) descaling. Well surveillance and maintenance became more expensive. Essential surveillance work often could not be performed due to unpredictable scaling restrictions. Well remedial/enhancement work became difficult, expensive and at times very frustrating. Number of idle wells started to rise as the operations people were not being able to cope with the amount of challenges posed by the wells and process facilities as the scale deposition, sand production and emulsion problem started to cause widespread frequent equipment & instrument malfunction. Consequently, compressor trip, process upsets etc became the normal order of the day. Production declined sharply at a rate of about 26% per year over '94 to '97. In early '98 it was producing an average 5.8 MSTB/d of oil with a water cut of about 90%. That decline trend together with the operational challenges (sand, scale and emulsion) threatened the economic viability of Tinggi operations.

AB  - Abstract Agbami is a prolific deep-water field which commenced production in 2008 and achieved peak production a year later, in 2009. Plateau production has been maintained in the field since 2009 through various efforts which include drilling of additional wells, pressure maintenance by gas and water injection, acid stimulation and choke/well-lineup optimizations. This paper focuses on the production optimization in the Agbami field obtained from choke and well-lineup optimizations. Agbami production system is an intelligent network that comprises of completions, wells, subsea flowlines and risers. Currently there are 24 wells, 8 subsea flowlines and 8 production risers in the production system. Multiple wells flow commingled in each riser, but each well can be lined-up to either of two risers in a riser loop. Parameters such as pressure, temperature etc. are monitored in real time at different nodes in the network. Production optimizations are achieved by manipulating the production control chokes at the completions, wells or risers; and/or by changing the line-up of the wells. Robust surveillance and monitoring are key to achieving successful production optimization. Periodic production tests are done at the completion, well and commingled riser level; while periodic pressure build-ups are done on the completion level. These surveillance data (plus real-time data) are used to update the completion, well and riser constraints and to calibrate the production network model. By continuously monitoring the operating constraints and comparing the constraints with the current production data, optimization opportunities are routinely identified. The identified opportunities are evaluated using the calibrated model and if viable, are proposed for execution. The key challenge is having good calibrated production network model to use for optimization. Choke and well lineup optimizations have proven to be an effective approach to obtaining increased production at no cost. These efforts have led to an average production gain of 12,000 BOPD per year in the past 8 years in Agbami field.

AB  - Abstract Oil wells performance can be determined from completed zone productivity, completion type and size, and surface facilities. A significant surface tool, wellhead choke, can profoundly impact on the well performance. Determining the optimum choke size can result in improving the production of the well by altering the wellhead pressure, therefore the pressure drop. Increasing the bean size above optimum might result in decreasing wellhead pressure below flowline pressure and prevent the oil from flowing. To determine the optimum choke size for oil well; live trial and error could be helpful, though it is not practical and need to be combined with a well simulation analysis and history matching. A multiphase flow simulator is applied on a set of selected wells, having bottlenecks and backpressure issues in Kuwaiti oilfields. The simulation has been developed by choosing a precise flow correlation that presents a reliable flow behavior and pressure drop results. A comparison of different flow correlations was performed against the actual test readings to eliminate a potential error from the simulation against the actual readings. Changing the choke bean size was a quick, effective, and economical solution to overcome the bottlenecks and backpressure issues in individual candidates. Simulating the formation productivity and assessing the well performance and changing the choke size can increase the successfulness chance of the live trial and error procedure. It can also help in categorizing the wells whether to be a candidate to have choke size change, or another solution is required to flow the well such as a surface pump, artificial lift, or changing the receiving facility pressure, if possible. All the selected eighteen wells are vertical or slightly deviated with an oil API gravity between 32 and 35 degrees, and the flow behavior correlations were between the Beggs and Brill (1973) empirical correlation and the Ansari (1994) mechanistic model. The comparison between multiple sensitivity analyses proved that both models are reliable and can be applied to the selected field. Simulating the wells had increased the choke size debottlenecking approach successfulness rate by 70 percent, and increase the oil production up to 6,000 barrels per day. A debottlenecking analysis is presented in this project, and supported with data matching and field test results. The procedure to optimize the choke size is explained in details using a multiphase flow simulator and an in-house developed excel sheet. Several additional approaches were analyzed to overcome backpressure issues, like using ESP artificial lift method.

AB  - Abstract Chokes are used to limit production rates to meet sale contract, comply with regulations, protect surface equipment from wearing out, avoid sand problems due to high drawdown, and control flow rate limited by capacity of the facility. Single gas phase flow through choke is vital to oil industry because not only an accurate estimation of gas flow rate guarantees a reliable supply to the end users, thus the predictable revenue from gas sale for the company, but also protect the equipment from breaking as a result of high gas rate. Nevertheless, importance of gas metering cannot be overemphasized. Gas flow through choke had been studied by numerous investigators, Different choke flow models are available from the literature, and they have to be chosen based on the flow regimes, that is, subsonic or sonic flow. The most common used flow equations developed by Shapiro, Zucrow and Hofmann are used for subsonic and sonic flow, respectively. Sonic flow happens when downstream to upstream pressure ratio is equal to critical pressure ratio. A careful review of these equations indicated that they are not theoretically rigorous and give inaccurate gas flow rate for the real gas. Thus these equations need to be modified in order to be used to calculate gas flow rate under both flow regimes. After a thoroughly analysis and derivation we came up with equations that have solid base. New correlations that reconcile the issue caused by approximation method used to derive the old gas flow equations were based on both engineering judgment and physical phenomenon. The error in the old equation can be corrected with the new equations. New equations provide good approaches to quantify gas flow through choke. Introduction Gas experiences a choked flow when it passes through a restriction, such as a nozzle, an orifice, or a valve, into a lower pressure environment. Usually these types of restrictions are called chokes. Choke can be classified as fixed diameter choke and adjustable diameter choke. The knowledge of choke performance will help us understand the gas transient flow through choke. It is useful for pipe/tank leakage detection and analysis as well. Choke performance can be used to detect the blockage in the pipe due to scaling or hydration. As we already know, gas flow through choke can be divided into subsonic flow and sonic flow according to flow regime. Sonic flow is defined as whenever the fluid flow velocity through a choke or throated pipe reaches the velocity of sound in the fluid under the in-situ condition. In another word, the upstream cannot "feel?? the pressure wave propagated from downstream upward since the fluid is travelling in the opposite direction with the same velocity under sonic flow conditions. At this point, it is necessary to clarify a common mistake that thinks the flow rate did not change due to maximum velocity even the upstream pressure changes. This is incorrect because although the velocity is constant, the density varies as pressure changes, so does the mass flow rate. Therefore an increasing in upstream pressure will increase the mass flow rate. Since the estimations of the gas velocity and the sound velocity are not always easy to be accomplished in the field. From the practical point of view, downstream to upstream pressure ratio is often used to determine if the flow falls in sonic flow or subsonic region is the critical pressure ratio. The critical pressure ratio is a function of the specific heat ratio of gas, which is expressed as (Perry, 1984)

AB  - Abstract Chokes are control valves built into the production systems so that wells can be produced at desired rates and in the same time reservoir depletion and sweep can be optimized; and formation and well completion integrity can be protected. The use of surface chokes also allows surface flowlines and facilities to be designed more economically due to reduced pressure ratings. Substantial pressure drops can occur through well surface chokes, especially at early stages of production when the reservoir pressure is still high and lower choke settings are applied. This paper investigates energy loss through wellhead chokes for gas wells with the laws of thermodynamics. Calculation methods and applicable equations are presented. Example calculations show that energy loss can be significant as a result of choking applied to wells. This is especially true when one considers the number of wells and the total daily production that a company has. The energy waste can be potentially avoided by extracting the fluid flow energy to produce electricity. In remote areas, subsea or on offshore platforms, the generated electricity can be used to power equipment present at the wellsites such as sensors, communication devices, heaters or pumps. The electricity can also be fed into existing power grids. The potential benefit includes reduction in field energy consumption and operating costs, energy conservation and environmental protection. Introduction The oil and gas industry faces many challenges in terms of energy consumption and costs. In some wells with extremely low rates of oil or gas daily production and high percentages of watercut, the high consumption of electricity and other energy sources can serve as a determining factor whether the well is economical to produce from or not. Indubitably, energy cost might not be of a significant importance in Saudi Arabia where most of the existing wells are producing at very high oil or gas rates; but the fact that there are thousands of gas and oil wells all around the Eastern and Central regions of the Kingdom makes the total energy consumption cost a major factor. In addition, many wells have been producing for over 50 years and are maturing and requiring energy to artificially lift the wells since the reservoir pressure is not sufficient to lift fluids to surface naturally, and by energy harvesting the reduction in costs will be tangible. Energy harvesting and conservation has become a topic of high importance in the industry and this paper will mainly discuss the amount of energy loss across a choke valve in a condensate gas well. The wellhead pressure (upstream) gets reduced by the choke valve, which causes an increase in the gas velocity and a reduction in the temperature as well as a loss in the energy. This paper will discuss the amount of energy loss in a selected gas condensate well and present alternative methods for capturing this energy instead of wasting it.

AB  - Abstract Controlling and monitoring steam injection into heavy oil reservoirs are important elements of heat management. Static chokes with tapered-bean inserts are the most reliable and cost-effective means of controlling wellhead steam injection rates. However, adjustable steam chokes are often used because  1. Rate changes can be made without interruption of steam supply to the well. 2. An inventory of bean inserts is not required. Adjustable or multiple orifice valve (MOV) chokes have two disks, each with a pair of holes (orifices). The size of the choke opening is adjusted by rotating one disk causing the two pairs of holes on each disk to overlap by differing amounts. This paper presents the results of field tests conducted to assess the flow control and monitoring capability of MOV steam chokes. Topics include adjustment precision and reproducibility, critical and subcritical flow conditions, and comparison of calculated and measured flow rates. Introduction As a steam flood matures, injection rates are often adjusted on a pattern-by-pattern basis to achieve and maintain sufficient reservoir heating efficiency. Initial cyclic steam stimulation (CSS) of heavy-oil reservoirs provides a means of enhancing primary production. CSS activity within steam flood projects is often employed to improve reservoir heating efficiency and recover bypassed oil. Successful steam flood and CSS projects incorporate effective methods to control and monitor steam injection rates. Historically, both static and adjustable chokes have been used to control steam rates to continuous and cyclic injection wells. Rubel (1989) and Griston (1995) have shown that Thornhill-Craver style static chokes provide an effective means of controlling and monitoring steam flow rate. MOV chokes are often used because they allow rate adjustment without interrupting the steam supply to the wells or replacing bean inserts. A schematic of a typical MOV choke is shown in Fig. 1. Flow rate is adjusted by rotating a movable disk relative to a fixed disk, each having a pair of holes or orifices. The holes are typically circular as shown in Fig 2. Alternatively, some high flow capacity MOV chokes utilize pie-shaped holes. In either case, noncircular flow geometry occurs as the holes in each disk overlap. Valve adjustment is typically indicated as percent open (0% to 100%) or as an equivalent 64th of an inch diameter. A typical flow control curve is shown in Fig. 3. The dead band reflects the minimum disk rotation required to achieve overlap of the orifices. The non-linear shape of the curve reflects the irregular flow geometry. This non-linear response characteristic makes it necessary to use numerous valve coefficients to translate the MOV choke setting to flow rate.

AB  - This paper was presented as part of the student paper contest associatedwith the European Petroleum Conference.AbstractProduction of a well at high water cut is associated with problems inseparation efficiency of the oil-in-water emulsion. In this, the smallest sizesof the oil droplets are the decisive factor, negatively and greatly influencedby the choke valve. This valve breaks the produced distribution down to toomany and too small droplets for the separation equipment to economically cleanthe water and isolate the oil.Laboratory experiments allowed us to investigate the break-up effects ofchoke valves and to validate existing predictive theories. By using differentchoke types, significant reduction of break-up was accomplished. The effect ofchoke geometry on break-up is explained by an interplay of the time thatdroplets remain in a choke on the one hand, and the time needed for completebreak-up under the current turbulence regime on the other. Hereby, the spatialdistribution of energy dissipation, linked to the geometry of the choke, playsan important role.IntroductionOften water is produced along with oil. When the age of a well matures, thewater cut tends to increase. In the after-life of a well, the percentage ofwater can by far exceed that of oil. Wells with water cuts of 95% are noexception, which implies that these wells produce an oil-in-water emulsion.Chokes are installed on every well to control the pressure and flow rate.They work on the basis of energy dissipation by increased turbulence.Downstream of the valve the pressure is brought down to safer values to workwith, and the emulsified liquids must be separated. This should be donecarefully in order not to loose valuable oil and to clean the water beforedisposal. The efficiency of a separator is confined by the droplet-sizedistribution offered to it.

AB  - The most important contributer to Improved Oil Recovery (IOR) on mature fields is drilling of infill wells. Managed Pressure Drilling (MPD) and Continuous Circulation System (CCS) techniques can be used for improved control of bottomhole pressure when drilling wells in depleted fields with narrow pressure windows, but rig heave is a challenge when drilling from floating drilling units. Rig heave, caused by sea waves, induces pressure oscillations downhole that may exceed the operational pressure window. These oscillations are called "surge & swab" and occur both during tripping in and out of hole as well as during drill pipe connections, when the topside heave compensation system used during drilling is disabled because the drill pipe is put in slips. Downhole choking was introduced as a method to reduce downhole pressure oscillations induced by the rig heave and the concept was tested in laboratory scale and using computer simulations (Kvernland et al., 2018). The simulations were perfomed using a purpose-developed software which utilizes such input variables as wave height, pump flow, drill pipe movements, rig characteristic (RAO), drilling fluid properties as well as well design, drill pipe and Bottom Hole Assembly (BHA) data to simulate downhole pressure, induced by rig heave. The simulator is designed to model dynamic interactions between the drilling fluid and the drill string in a rigorous manner, which gives it ability to accurately predict fast downhole changes, such as ones induced by ocean waves. This paper gives an overview of the surge & swab simulator, describing its capabilities and limitations. Data from drilling of a North Sea well is then used to validate the simulations made using the software. The well, used as example in this paper, was drilled conventionally from a floating rig. The downhole pressure variations recorded during three different drill pipe connections are compared with simulated downhole pressure. The simulations are based on the recorded rig heave as well as the actual drilling fluid, well design and drill pipe data. Results show that there is a good correlation between simulated and actual measured downhole pressure. The surge & swab simulation software is then used to simulate the same drilling pipe connections using three different techniques and combinations of techniques utilized for improved downhole pressure control: (1) Managed Pressure Drilling (MPD) (2) Managed Pressure Drilling combined with Continuous Circulation System (CCS) and (3) MPD combined with CCS and a downhole choke. Results show that rig heave-induced downhole pressure variations are reduced to a level which is considered acceptable for drilling a well with narrow pressure window for the last two cases, while utilization of backpressure MPD alone is not sufficient. The combination of MPD and CCS reduced surge & swab for two out of three connections. For the third and deepest connection, the surge & swab increased. The largest reduction in significant downhole pressure variations (43-68 % vs. conventional drilling for the three connections) occurs when MPD and CCS are combined with downhole choking. Future work will consist of further developing the surge & swab simulator so that it will be possible to utilize it in well planning and as real-time decision support during drilling operations. The simulator will also be developed to include possibility of simulating various well completion operations such as running casings and liners. A prototype of the downhole choke is currently being tested at the mud loop of the Ullrigg test rig facility in Stavanger, Norway, and the next development phase consists of designing and building a complete downhole tool for testing in a well.

AB  - AbstractScaled model experiments are a valuable aid to steam flood design and simulation. They can also be an important adjunct to numerical simulators, when numerical simulators do not represent a recovery process adequately. Field data for history matching and data describing interaction between various components, additives, and porous media may not be readily available. Scaling techniques that are currently being used can also be limited, as they require porous media and pressure conditions different from those of the field being studied. Any properties dependent on pressure (e.g. PVT properties) or porous media (e.g. relative permeabilities) are not scaled accurately. New scaling criteria were developed which allow field porous media and pressure conditions to be used. Two of the new approaches achieve this in a novel manner by relaxing the requirements of geometric similarity. The advantages and disadvantages of each approach were investigated.In order to compare the capabilities of the scaling approaches, experimental results from a large model were compared with those from smaller models which were scaled using each approach. The ability of each approach to predict such parameters as energy and temperature distribution, oil production rate, water-oil ratio, steam zone size and steam breakthrough are presented.The scaling approaches which use field porous media and pressure conditions yielded results in agreement with those of an accepted high-pressure approach from the literature. The new approaches provide scaling options which should be better for steam processes which use additives (PVT properties must be scaled), processes which use pressure cycles (fluid compressibilities must be scaled), and processes in which it is essential to use the same porous media as found in the field.

AB  - Abstract The objective of this project was to improve wellsite safety, optimize choke life, and reduce downtime in highly erosive Dawson Montney (British Columbia, Canada) gas wells through use of real-time flow coefficient (Cv) diagnostics. This was achieved by developing a methodology to trend well behaviour, characterize wear patterns and create Wear Reports based on user defined set-points. A 2-phase flow coefficient equation was used to reduce error in higher liquid-gas-ratio wells and to improve universality. Percent Cv deviation (%Dev) is introduced and calculated in relation to the theoretical choke curves and acts as a key wear indicator. A custom Steady-State Slope-Fitting algorithm and workflow was developed to numerically characterize choke behavior. Using well specific slope durations based on flow behavior as well as elimination of statistical outliers, reliable slopes can be calculated. Logical statements comparing the slopes of key parameters to user adjustable setpoints identify wear patterns and create a shortlisted "Wear Report". These wells can be quickly validated using a custom Spotfire based visualization template. A subset of the Dawson Montney Field (107 wells) was originally piloted to validate methodology. Two generalized wear signatures (for auto and manual choke control) were theorized and vetted using a combination of wear trends and failure analyses which showed high internal wear. By comparing slopes of flow rate, choke position, and %Dev to set-point values, wear signatures can be identified. Workflow was easily adapted to be effective with the Dawson Montney standard choke type as well as a new choke pilot. Many wells have exhibited wear signatures and have been correctly identified by the software, thus increasing safety between scheduled onsite choke condition checks. Early indicators have been communicated to field personnel and well specific plans have been made to replace chokes. In many cases, early detection has allowed pre-planning of onsite work to minimize well downtime (from 24–48 hours downtime to 4 hours or less) and maximize cash flow generation ($10–20k accelerated, using typical rates and netbacks). This program has now expanded to over 400 Montney wells and will be monitored by a continuously manned Operation Control Center. Use of a slope fitting algorithm to numerically describe flow/wear behavior, creation of prelim wear set points/limits, and the wear signature identification logic is a novel approach to detecting and mitigating issues related to choke wear, which ultimately improves safety and reduces costs.

AB  - Abstract CO2 storage in saline aquifers may be used to reduce greenhouse gas emissions. After injection the CO2-plume migrates along the top of the aquifer for hundreds to thousands of years. An estimate of the area invaded by the CO2-plume is of interest for site selection. During plume migration, CO2 is trapped as residual gas in the wake of the plume. Reduction of the mobile CO2 volume by residual trapping would limit potential leakage. Plume evolution can be divided into an early stage, where the CO2 has invaded the full thickness of the aquifer, and a late stage where the plume has spread enough to occupy only the top part of the aquifer. In the early regime we choose local variables for the dimensional analysis, to obtain a scaling law for the tip position xtip / t1=2. At late time we choose global variables, obtaining a new scaling relation, xtip / t1=3. Numerical simulations confirm the change in scaling for the tip position. We also discuss the effect of residual trapping on plume migration. We present semi-analytic results for a plume spreading in a horizontal aquifer and numerical results for a plume in a sloping aquifer. In the horizontal aquifer plume volume decays as a power law, so that the efficiency of residual trapping decreases with time. In the sloping case initial power law decay is followed by ever faster decrease in volume. The change in scaling for the CO2 front has not been discussed before. This change from t1=2 to t1=3 scaling shows that the plume will spread significantly slower at late times, suggesting that the plume will stay more confined than early measurements would indicate. Residual trapping will be very effective in sloping aquifers, and may be the dominant trapping mechanism. Introduction This study is motivated by carbon capture and storage (CCS), also known as CO2-sequestration, in deep geological formations. CCS has been suggested as a way to reduce greenhouse gas emissions, and to mitigate global climate change1. When CO2 is injected into an aquifer, typically at a depth greater than 800 m, it forms an immiscible CO2-rich vapor phase. In the temperature and pressure range encountered in geological CO2 storage, the density of the CO2-vapor is less than the density of the brine2. Due to its positive buoyancy CO2 can only be stored in aquifers that are overlain by an impermeable seal that forms a barrier to upward migration of CO2-vapor. The buoyant CO2-vapor will spread underneath the seal and along the top of the aquifer as a gravity current. Leakage of CO2 back into the atmosphere is a mayor concern for the long term storage of CO2 in saline aquifers. To be able to assess the risk of CO2 leakage we need to understand how fast and how far the CO2 is spreading, and how long it remains mobile or positively buoyant. The area of an aquifer that is invaded by injected CO2, often called the footprint, is the most important length scale during CO2 injection. Estimates of the evolution of the footprint are useful during site selection, to estimate when CO2 will encounter a particular feature such as an abandoned well, a fault, or an outcrop. Estimates for the footprint also guide the area that has to be monitored at a particular time.

AB  - Abstract A model is presented for predicting the scaling tendencies of barium, strontium and calcium sulphates resulting from the mixing of injected and formation waters, as well as the effects of temperature and pressure. The model is able to predict competitive simultaneous co-precipitation of BaSO4, CaSO4 and SrSO4 of which sulphate is the common ion, reflecting closely the precipitation of more than one sulphate mineral. The sulphate scaling tendency may be predicted for a single fluid or solutions of mixed waters at all ratios by calculating the supersaturations and amounts of precipitation of the sulphates at temperatures and pressures covering surface and reservoir conditions. For mixed scale occurrence of more than one sulphate, an iterative process is used. The model is based on the concept of thermodynamic equilibria between the scaling ions in the solution and their solid precipitates, which requires the knowledge of the sulphates solubilities at various brine compositions, temperatures and pressures representative of oilfield operation conditions. In the model, the solubilities of BaSO4, CaSO4 and SrSO4 are regenerated from the published solubility data by Pitzer's ion interaction approach, a widely accepted method because of its sound theoretical basis and accurate representation of the properties of aqueous electrolyte solutions. The generated solubilities by this method agree with the published data within the error of experimental measurement. The paper presents the scale prediction results and comments on its application in both predicting formation damage scaling tendency and also within reservoir modelling studies where scaling within the near production well zone is a concern. Introduction In North Sea offshore operations where sea water injection is a common development practice, barium sulphate, calcium sulphate and strontium sulphate scale deposition is a concern. Barium sulphate and related scale occurrence is considered a serious potential problem of causing formation damage within the near production well zone. Sulphate scales may occur due to changes of temperature and/or pressure while a water flows from one location to the other, but the major cause of sulphate scaling comes from the chemical incompatibility between the injected sea water which is sulphate rich and the formation water which originally contains high concentrations of barium, calcium and/or strontium ions. An accurate, convenient and fast model capable of predicting such scaling problems may be helpful in planning a waterflood scheme and also an effective scale prevention technique may be selected in following the application of a prediction model which predicts the scaling tendency, scale type and potential scale severity. A number of prediction models have been reported by Vetter et al(1-6). This model is considered an improvement on the previous models.

AB  - ABSTRACTA mechanistic analysis was performed on preferential attack nucleating at the weld metal joining flange and pipe adjacent to a choke valve installed at the well head of a CO2 bearing gas condensate well. The main cause of the preferential attack of the weld metal was revealed to exist in the difference of the corrosion rate between the weld metal and the surrounding materials. The electrochemical analysis and the immersion test in the simulating environment for the well head condition indicated that the corrosion rates of the composing materials depended on their cathodic currents in their corrosion systems. The corrosion losses calculated based on polarization resistance indicated a good agreement with that of the immersion test. Based on the results of the analysis the case was concluded to be a typical uneven corrosion. INTRODUCTIONMany research works have been published on studying material degradations in CO2 bearing environments 1'2. In CORROSION Journal through recent years, we can find much information on the corrosion mechanisms on the above mentioned environments : the controlling processes in corrosion mechanisms3"4,accelerating effects of flow of the environmental fluidsS"6'7,and the influences of the alloying elements and structures 8. However, unexpected corrosion morphologies occurred in this environments because of the complicated effects of the above mentioned factors on the material degradations. This investigation is concerning with the preferential attack of the weld metal between materials of flange and pipe adjacent to the choke valve, which initiated in the environment at the well head of a gas condensate well. The environment at the well head is shown in Table 1 as assayed in the condensate water. The observed morphology of the preferential attack of the weld metal joining flange and pipe is shown in Fig. 1. This flange connected the flow pipe of the down stream side to a choke valve installed at the well head. The weld metal was layered from the inner surface to the outer surface with tungsten inert gas (TIG) welding for the first and second pass and with submerged arc welding(SAW) for the successive passes. The macroscopic observation of the weldment revealed that the TIG weld layer was preferentially attacked. An analysis was performed to elucidate the mechanism forming the prominent difference of the corrosion rate between the weld metal and the adjacent materials. Structural observation and the estimation of the corrosion rate with the immersion test and the electrochemical measurement were employed for this analysis. Based on the experimental results ,the cause of the preferential attack of the weld metal was speculated.

AB  - Abstract Calcium Sulfate (CaSO4) is precipitated due to super saturation of Ca2+ and SO42-ions that can be created due to change pH, pressure, temperature or due to mixing of the brines. Among the CaSO4 species, CaSO4.2H2O or gypsum is stable in solid phase at lower temperature below 50 °C which has been observed frequently in wells treated with CO2 flooded-EOR technique. As a result, mineral scaling, especially calcium sulfate (gypsum) deposition has been a serious flow assurance problem in oil and gas production leading to production shut down because of formation damage or equipment failure. Use of scale inhibitors may be the efficient method to prevent the scale formation. However, there is a knowledge gap on types of scale inhibitor that might be efficient in controlling the calcium sulfate scaling under varied field conditions. Additionally, there is a need of an efficient method to evaluate the performance of scale inhibitor and simulate the dynamic field condition. This study provides information on several options of inhibitors to control CaSO4 at various conditions as established with modified laser-light based Kinetic Turbidity Test (mKTT) method that can assess several samples over a range of concentrations simultaneously. Other newly developed modified Continuous Stirred Tank Reactor (mCSTR) method showed to be an efficient tool to understand scale inhibitor performances, as it can overcome limitations of dynamic scale loop (DSL) with low residence time and low volume capacity of capillary tubing. Similarly, as minimum effective dosage (MED) needed can be easily established in one setting with mCSTR method. It showed much better efficiency compared to that of standard bottle test, which suffers lack of dynamics and multiple bottle tests needed to establish MED. This study provides more effective test methodologies for scale inhibitors performance testing. The mCSTR apparatus can be used for various mineral scales such as barium sulfate, halite, calcite, etc. Additionally, this study will provide a mathematical model (scaling risk-inhibitor dosage recommendation) via mCSTR method which can be used to predict scaling tendency and inhibitor need under desired conditions.

AB  - A multiphase flow equation describing the behavior of orifice flow may be used directly to evaluate well performance as a function of choke size; upstream choke pressure; choke temperature; producing and solution GOR; gas, oil, and water gravities; and a discharge coefficient. The coefficient compensates for nonideal factors excluded in the development of the equation and relates theoretical oil production rates through chokes to field-measured rates. Discussion Various developments have been published that present theory and correlations for describing simultaneous liquid and gas flow though a restrictive orifice. The correlations of Poettmann and Beck were intended to aid in the prediction of gas-liquid flow through chokes. Their development followed the original presentation by Ros and was derived for an average orifice discharge coefficient. Poettmann and Beck considered the polytropic expansion of the gaseous phase of the fluid expanding through the choke. The polytropic expansion theory was used successfully by Ros and is perhaps the most rigorous development in the application of orifice flow theory to oilfield conditions. Basically, the derivation of any orifice relationship is dependent on two main criteria. First, an expression must be written relating the flowing fluid specific volume and velocity to the mass flow rate. Second, an independent equation must be written incorporating the behavior of the gaseous phase of the fluid with pressure. The above stipulations are met by the following relationships. The energy balance around a fluid flowing through an orifice may be written as 144 = 0.........................(1) The polytropic expansion equation relating the specific volume of the gas, (Vf - Vl), to the confining pressure, p, the polytropic expansion constant, b, and the ratio p, the polytropic expansion constant, b, and the ratio of specific heat at constant pressure to specific heat at constant volume, n, is n p(Vf - Vl) = b...............................(2) When an expression for the orifice velocity, v2, is achieved with Eqs. 1 and 2, a relationship for the mass rate of flow through the choke is achieved by using the resulting relationship: v2 qm = CA ------...................................(3) vf2 where C is the orifice discharge coefficient, and Subscript 2 denotes downstream orifice throat conditions. The solution of Eqs. 1 through 3 is given in Appendix A. The results are summarized below. For critical orifice flow, the critical pressure ratio, Ec, defined as the ratio of the upstream pressure to the downstream choke pressure, occurs when = ------- = 0; = critical pressure ratio. (4) The condition following from the solution of Eqs. 1 and 3 for flow is ...................................(5) JPT P. 843

AB  - Abstract Objectives/Scope For thirty-five years, TechnipFMC has been providing high pressure and high temperature flexible pipes to the drilling industry. These unbonded flexible pipes rated up to 15k psi working pressure are used worldwide as part of the choke and kill system of onshore and offshore drilling facilities or units. Following recent high-pressure reserve discoveries and to enable future exploration of formations with anticipated higher pressures, the drilling industry has started upgrading drilling safety equipment like blowout preventers to higher pressure ratings. Unbonded flexible pipe technology is following this trend, striving to continue providing the industry with reliable high-pressure choke and kill flexible pipes. Methods, Procedures, Process The information presented in this document is the outcome of a full-scale test campaign performed within company owned facilities or in collaboration with worldwide recognized test laboratories. Results, Observations, Conclusions This paper will present the trials performed on the presently available 15k psi rated product and the results of the testing toward qualification of the first choke and kill unbonded flexible pipes with a 20k psi internal pressure rating. In addition to the high-pressure upgrade, progress was made in the fire performance domain by improving flexible pipe product knowledge with regard to the fire resistance. This has been achieved through a large fire test campaign performed over the years. The document will detail the tests performed, the procedures followed, and the understanding of the different failure modes observed. Novel/Additive Information Major achievements in the development of high pressure choke and kill unbonded flexible pipe technology will be presented to the industry with a focus on qualification testing and fire performance.

AB  - Abstract Three oil producing fields in the Danish sector of the North Sea, Gorm, Dan and Halfdan, have been assessed for downhole scale control. All three fields have water injection. To date downhole scaling has not been perceived as a significant production problem in these fields. This paper presents the results of a review of the well service history for each well in the three fields which identified when and where scales had been encountered and estimated the impact of scale on well intervention operations. A thermodynamic equilibrium model for mineral solubilities was used to assess the scaling tendencies of sulphate and carbonate scales from bottom hole to wellhead. The observational data for downhole scale has been compared with the scaling predictions and a risk assessment for carbonate and sulphate scales developed for each well. The implications of this study on industry trends are discussed. Introduction Downhole scaling of mineral deposits has been a feature of oil production since the beginning of the modern industry. Self-scaling of produced waters, primarily calcite has been a persistent problem, however, with the advent of large seawater injection projects in the North Sea and elsewhere the potential for downhole scale was greatly increased. For over 20 years in the North Sea the management of downhole scale has been a significant challenge. Whilst the cost of scale has been high, both in terms of deferred production and remedial treatment, downhole scale management has generally been successful, even in the most severe scaling environments. Table 1 shows the revenue from worldwide sales of scale control chemicals by region and application in 2002, the North Sea is clearly seen to be a major user of this technology, particularly for downhole scale control. The initial challenge of downhole scale prevention in the North Sea saw major advances in the modelling of mineral solubilities with several software packages being available. This modelling capability, together with improved scale inhibitor chemistries and understanding of the ‘Squeeze' (injection of scale inhibitor chemical into producing wells) process itself was sufficient in most cases for effective management of downhole scale. The development of fields with very high barium concentrations (>500 mg/l) such as Brae, Miller, T-Block, Njord and South Arne forced downhole scale management into a new direction; the removal of sulphate ions from the injected seawater by reverse osmosis (RO). Whilst RO units can be difficult to operate they have been effective in maintaining scale control in the most challenging of environments. The Miller field chose not to use RO and, by a combination of water management and squeeze inhibition, maintained production well beyond initial design; however it is doubtful if this approach would be taken in the future. RO technology is now being exported outside of the North Sea region; in 2002 there were 11 installed units worldwide, this number is expected to grow to 40 or 50 by 2010.

AB  - Abstract Barite (BaSO4) is one of the common scales in oil and gas production. Extensive work has been conducted to study barite nucleation and inhibition at temperatures below 100 °C. However, with the advance in deepwater exploration and production which can encounter high temperature conditions, a better understanding of barite scaling risk at high temperature (e.g., >150 °C) becomes essential. In this paper, a systematic study was conducted to explore barite nucleation kinetics from 70-200 °C in synthetic brines containing phosphonate (0-10 ppm) or polymeric (5-10 ppm) scale inhibitors. A 2-hour protection time with or without any detectable barite nucleation was employed to define the scaling risk. To detect barite nucleation, two novel apparatus were developed, a modified dynamic flow loop and a batch reactor. The modified dynamic flow loop has a retention time of up to 4 hours and is ideal to carry out experiments at above 100 °C. Ba concentrations in the effluents were monitored to determine barite nucleation more precisely compared to traditional "tube blocking" technique. The new batch reactor employs our newly developed laser detection method, a transparent pressure tube, and an oil bath. The transparent pressure tube allows laser to pass through and can withstand 150 psi pressure at 150 °C, which therefore provides an efficient and convenient approach to study the precipitation kinetics of scales and evaluate inhibition efficiency of inhibitors at high temperature. Constant inhibitor concentration isoplethes of diethylenetriamine pentamethylene phosphonic acid (DTPMP) for barite inhibition were constructed based on our experimental data. The results of this study can facilitate the selection of an appropriate DTPMP concentration for scale treatment for high-temperature oil and gas production.

AB  - Abstract   Historically, choke gas equations have been extensively used for gross estimation about gas volumes.  These analytical models give a quick evaluation on gas volume but also face some serious limitations on specific topics like water presence, excessive gas velocity and pressure drop, limited differential pressure and high condensate to gas ratios.   Many different efforts have being completed using several analytical models which can be applicable under certain conditions. This paper details a new predictive model for estimating the gas rate measurement through wellhead chokes and also covers all efforts for Saudi Aramco to get a single digit error on estimating gas rates for Ghawar gas condensate producers by implementing this new analytical model. Additionaly, the application of this new gas equation covers a wide range of operative conditions as well as gives great benefits since perspective of:   Reducing gas allocation error Improving gas estimation while comparing with regular test separator Identifying well optimization opportunities Getting cost saving while minimizing use of conventional well-testing Validating venturi meter calculations Improving well performance and diagnostic Keeping surface equipment under optimum operative conditions Minimizing erosion while providing optimum gas velocity calculations   The main objective of this paper is sharing this equation with Gas Producing Engineering Worldwide community and covering methodology of implementation as well as sharing practical field application cases.

AB  - AbstractChokes are one of if not the most important flow controllers in oil producing wells. Selecting the optimum choke size is the first step in choke design. An empirical correlation that relates the choke size to other parameters was developed. The correlation covers a wide range of flow rates and choke sizes. It was based on 3554 production test data from ten fields in the Middle East. The correlation applies for critical flow conditions which makes it useful for choke design purposes. Statistical error analysis shows that for the data used in this study, the new correlation outperforms all published correlations in the literature.IntroductionTangren et al.(1) offered the first significant study on multiphase flow through chokes. His approach is only applicable when liquid is the continuous phase (volumetric gas-liquid ratio is less than 1). Gilbert(2) in 1954 developed the first empirical correlation where he used 268 production tests for choke sizes between 2.38 and 7.14 mm (6 and 18 sixty fourths of an inch). Ros(3,4,5) in 1960 expanded the Tangren approach and studied multiphase flow through chokes when gas is the continuous phase. To make the Ros equation and analysis available to oil field personnel. Poetmann and Beck(6) in 1963 converted the Ros equation to oil field units and reduced it to a graphical form. They tested their charts with 108 field production tests with choke size range of 1.59 ? 11.11 mm (4 ? 28 sixty fourths of an inch) and flow rates of 1.6 ? 206.7 std. m3/day (10 ? 1300 STDB). Omana(7) in 1969 conducted experiments with water and natural gas to derive his correlation. He used dimensionless analysis to come up with the final form of his equation. His range of tests data was 1.56 ? 5.56 mm (4 ? 14 64th of an inch) choke size and 127.2 std. m3/day (800 STDB) maximum flow rate. Fortunati(8) in 1972 developed two correlations for critical and subcritical floe regimes. For subcritical flow regime, he used curves that were previously published by Russian researchers. Guzov and Medviediev, Ashford and Pierce(9) in 1975, followed by Sachdeva(10) in 1986, focused attention on the subcritical flow regime. In both of their correlations, the specific heat ratio has to be known, while in practicality, it is not measured in the field and no reliable correlation exists to approximate it. Osman and Dokla(11) in 1988 also developed a correlation for gas condensate wells. Their data ranges from 11.11 ? 28.58 mm (28 ? 72 64th of an inch) with maximum flow rate of 206.7 std. m3/day (1300 STDB). Surbey(12) in 1989 used the Gilbert form to come up with a correlation for critical flow. He developed an iterative procedure that will give a better definition of the critical flow boundary.DiscussionMany researchers have studied multi-phase flow through chokes. However, published literature shows that the correlations previously developed were based on a small number of field data: on the other hand, most of them were based on laboratory experiments where limitations prevail in stimulating high flow rates, especially in the magnitudes of Middle East well production rates.

AB  - AbstractBarite scale formation in unconventional systems can severely reduce production rates and recovery. Barite in drilling mud (DM) is highly susceptible to dissolution (up to 20% of the total barite) when it interacts with a 15% hydrochloric acid spearhead leading to significant barite scaling as solution pH rises to circumneutral levels. In order to maintain the low pH spearhead that is favored by most operators, a new acid spearhead formulation was developed to stabilize the barite in place, closer to the borehole where open volume is large. This approach is dramatically different than typical scale mitigation practices in which precipitation from solution is targeted for control; but with unsatisfactory results. By using sulfuric acid instead of hydrochloric acid (equivalent acidity), the amount of Ba and SO4 leached from DM was reduced by > 850-fold. This major reduction in barite dissolution translates into a significant reduction in the dispersal of these mineral-forming aqueous species in the hydraulically fractured shale matrix. As a result, reprecipitation of barite scale in the fracture network is minimized. Because some unconventional systems have high concentrations of calcite that dissolves upon interaction with the acid spearhead, gypsum can precipitate due to excess Ca2+ derived from the calcite and its interaction with the additional SO42− introduced from the new acid spearhead formulation. To mitigate this potential scale formation, Na-citrate was added to chelate Ca2+ and inhibit gypsum formation. When only H2SO4 was used, Na-citrate was not able to completely inhibit gypsum formation in high carbonate systems. However, by adjusting the H2SO4/HCl ratios and including Na-citrate, both barite and gypsum scale in the stimulated rock volume can be mitigated. These findings suggest that an incremental new best-practice is to stabilize the Ba/SO4 in place rather than attempt to control precipitation from solution.IntroductionBarite is one of the most important and problematic types of mineral scale in unconventional shale systems. Depending on the mineralogy of the deposit and solution pH, the amount and location of barite scale can differ (Figure 1). In systems where the generation of secondary porosity is minimal because of low concentrations of carbonate minerals, the precipitation of barite can reduce permeability by > 15% (Alalli et al., 2018). Efforts to mitigate barite precipitation focus primarily on either keeping barite nucleation from occurring or altering the surface properties of newly formed barite crystals to limit adhesion to shale and pipe surfaces (Antonious, 1996; Jones et al., 2003; Shen et al., 2009; Mavredaki et al., 2011; Yan et al., 2015; Bhandari et al., 2016; He and Vidic, 2016; Yan et al., 2017). These methods have limited success due to the intentional introduction of high quantities of barite in unconventional systems through drilling mud (DM). Previous work has shown that dissolution of barite in DM due to the injection of chemicals into the subsurface, primarily the 15% HCl acid spearhead, releases both Ba2+ and SO42− into the system that can precipitate as barite in fractures and shale matrices (Jew et al., 2018). On a per-mass basis, the barite released from the DM by the acid spearhead is significantly higher than that from the shale itself, indicating that the DM is most likely the dominant Ba/SO4 source in these systems. Because of this underappreciated Ba/SO4 source in unconventional systems, we developed a new model for barite in the subsurface (Figure 2). Because Ba and SO4 are introduced into the system before stimulation fluid injection, any barite dissolved from the DM by the acid spearhead will be transported into stimulated rock volume (SRV) by the slickwater/slurry where precipitation will occur, necessitating a new approach to scale mitigation.

AB  - Abstract The objective of this study is to develop and validate a theoretical slip model for two-phase flow through chokes. As opposed to the models1,2 currently used by the industry, the present model accounts for slippage between the liquid and gas phases as they pass through the choke. The theoretical basis of the model is a 1D balance equation of mass, momentum and energy with the assumptions of constant quality and incompressible liquid phase. The present slip model is capable of predicting the critical/sub-critical flow boundary and the critical and sub-critical mass flow rates. A model validation study demonstrated the capability of the slip models to predict the critical flow boundary with an average error and standard deviation of 5.2% and 15.5% respectively. Furthermore, the present slip model predicted the sub-critical mass flow rate with an average error and standard deviation of 2.7% and 12.5%, respectively. Compared to existing no-slip models1,2 commonly used by the industry, the present slip model predictions outperformed their predictions, indicating the importance of the slippage phenomenon. Introduction The two common restrictions encountered in a production system are surface chokes and subsurface safety valves (SSSV). The purposes of installing chokes and SSSV's are different; however, the basic equations which govern the flow through these restrictions are very similar. There are two types of flow behavior across chokes, namely, critical and sub-critical. The critical flow occurs when the fluid velocity at the smallest cross section in the restriction is equal to the velocity of sound in that medium. When the velocity is less than the velocity of sound, we call it a sub-critical flow; if the velocity is greater than the velocity of sound, we call it a critical flow. If the flow is sub-critical, the flow rate is related to the pressure drop across the restriction. On the other hand, if the flow is critical, the rate is only related to the upstream pressure, thus reduction in down stream pressure does not affect the rate since the reduction can never be transmitted upstream. Predicting the flow pattern, critical/sub-critical boundary, as well as the flow rate across the choke is crucial for well productivity and optimization. Extensive studies were conducted and several models were developed on two-phase flow across chokes which mainly fall into two categories, namely empirical and theoretical models. The empirical models such as Gilbert3, Ros4, Achong5, Pilehvari6, Ashford and Pierce7, Osman and Dokla8, and Omana et al.9 were all developed on specific range of data and can not be extended beyond their range. The second category comprises the theoretical approaches, basically derived from mass, momentum and energy balances such as Sachdeva et al.1, Perkins2 and Selmer-Olsen et al.9 The theoretical models are mostly used by the industry because of their ability to simulate the physical phenomena, thus they are considered more accurate. The following is a brief description of these theoretical models. Sachdeva et al.1 acquired experimental data for critical, sub-critical flows and the boundary between them using air/water and air/kerosene system for different sizes of choke diameters ranging from 0.25 to 0.5 in. A theoretical model is developed from the 1D mass, momentum and energy balance equations for a two-phase gas liquid mixture to predict the critical and sub-critical mass fluxes, which is considered comprehensive since fluid properties are also involved. Perkins2 presented theoretical equations that describe isentropic multiphase flow across a choke valid for critical sub-critical flows. The model incorporates the oil, gas and water properties correlations to predict the critical/sub-critical boundary. An expression for total mass flow rate across the choke was developed through a combined equation of conservation of mass and isentropic expansion of a homogeneous multiphase mixture. Selmer-Olsen et al.10 acquired experimental data and developed the "Hydro?? model which uses a control volume approach for the choke orifice and its downstream to mechanistically account for irreversible loss process instead of using discharge coefficient only. The model is derived from the local cross-sectional averaged balance equations of mass, momentum and energy for steady-state flow of a multiphase mixture. Contrary to Sachdeva et al.1 and Perkins2 models, the "Hydro?? model accounts for slippage between the phases. Although the "Hydro?? model is more accurate, it is complex in formulation and solution for the boundary.

AB  - AbstractHorizontal wells are gaining increased prominence in primary recovery and steaminjection - it is said that in ten years' time, 85% of all wells drilled willbe horizontal. Yet experimental and theoretical modeling of horizontal wellsare still inadequate. This paper explores both of these areas.Equations were developed for three-phase and non-isothermal flow in thevicinity of a horizontal well, as well as flow inside the well. These were usedto obtain scaling criteria for designing laboratory experiments. The questionof skin factors for various types of perforations is also considered. Aninteresting idea offered is the use of variable diameter horizontalwells.Two types of model experiments were carried out. In one case, isotherma1experiments were conducted in visual models, using gas and water, and varioustypes of horizontal wells. The results showed the flow patterns and the effectof gas segregation on well performance. The second type of experiments utilizeda steam model, with a concentric well. Temperature distributions weredetermined and used to interpret oil recoveries and pressure behavior.Limitations of horizontal well modeling methods are pointed out and solutionssuggested. IntroductionIt has been reported extensively1,2 that horizontal wells offerprospects of better performance over conventional vertical wells. This improvedperformance is due primarily to larger contact area between the formation and ahorizontal well. This is especially true for thin oil formations where thereservoir contact area for a horizontal well can be hundreds of times that fora fully penetrating vertical well. Furthermore, horizontal wells whenstrategically placed can reduce water/gas coning and result in improvedcumulative recovery in view of the small drawdowns3. Horizontalwells are also believed to have a much better chance than vertical wells ofintersecting systems of vertical and horizontal fractures in an oil-bearingformation, and thus lead to higher production rates4. In steaminjection recovery of heavy oils and oil sands horizontal wells - especiallywhen combined with steam-assisted gravity drainage - could lead to highproduction rates, more uniform distribution of steam front leading to improvedsweep efficiency and cumulative oil recovery5,6.One aspect that has been so far largely neglected in discussions abouthorizontal well performance concerns with the flow in the vicinity of andinside a horizontal well. Often, it has been assumed that a horizontal well hasinfinite conductivity and that the flow in the well is predominately laminar -meaning the pressure drop across the well is not significant.Dikken7 showed that this assumption is not necessarily true for mostpractical situations, and that pressure drops across horizontal wells cansignificantly affect their performance.This paper attempts to contribute to an understanding of this aspect orhorizontal wells by presenting mathematical models or flow in the vicinity ofand inside a horizontal wellbore. These models were used to obtain scalingcriteria for a series of scaled model steam injection experiments. Data,including well pressure drop and fluid production rates in the presence of aperforated casing are also reported.

AB  - AbstractGeneral characterization of physical systems uses two aspects of data analysis methods: decomposition of empirical data to determine model parameters and reconstruction of the image using these characteristic parameters. Spectral methods, involving a frequency based representation of data, usually assume stationarity. These methods, therefore, extract only the average information and hence are not suitable for analyzing data with isolated or deterministic discontinuities, such as faults or fractures in reservoir rocks or image edges in computer vision.Wavelet transforms provide a multiresolution framework for data representation. They are a family of orthogonal basis functions that separate a function or a signal into distinct frequency packets that are localized in the time domain. Thus, wavelets are well suited for analyzing non-stationary data. In other words, a projection of a function or a discrete data set onto a time-frequency space using wavelets shows how the function behaves at different scales of measurement. Because wavelets have compact support, it is easy to apply this transform to large data sets with minimal computations.We apply the wavelet transforms to one-dimensional and two-dimensional permeability data to determine the locations of layer boundaries and other discontinuities. By binning in the time-frequency plane with wavelet packets, permeability structures of arbitrary size are analyzed. We also apply orthogonal wavelets for scaling up of spatially correlated heterogeneous permeability fields.IntroductionWhenever there is a need for processing large volumes of data one seeks to represent them in terms of their statistics or spectral content to reduce both the volume and redundancy of data. Examples of this application are abundant. In computer vision, efficient and economic data transmission is accomplished by representing images by their spectral content. In geophysics, identification of important features in seismic waveforms requires an efficient noise reduction by separating data into different frequency bands. Reservoir characterization in petroleum engineering and hydrology often uses spectral contents of the spatial distribution of reservoir properties, such as porosity and permeability, given by semi-variograms to represent the spatial structure of data.Reservoir characterization, which is the main focus of this paper, seeks to define a configuration of reservoir properties such that the image has desired properties. Usually, random realizations from a pre-defined probability density function, obtained from experimental observations, form the elements of all configurations. The solution procedure involves two steps. The first step involves data analysis for parameter estimation, such as statistics and spectral content of data. Often characteristics of spatial structures present in data are also determined in this step. The second step generates data (realizations) using the parameters determined in the first step. This step often also involves a scale change, such as scaling up for data reduction and scaling down for enhancement.P. 251

AB  - Abstract Different choke management strategies have been adopted by operators in the field. However, no general method exists for systematically selecting an optimum choke management strategy. In this study, we propose a general method for the selection of bean-up duration and bean-up strategy (choke management), that will maximize well productivity by minimizing formation damage, reducing sand production and reducing the impact of multiphase flow effects. Strategies of stepwise bottom-hole pressure (BHP) adjustments are compared using the principle of superposition and the analytical solution of the diffusivity equation for vertical wells operating under different choke settings. The optimum choke management strategy is based on the anticipated formation damage mechanisms. For example, if fines migration and sand production are a concern, then minimizing the near wellbore pressure gradients is the primary criterion for the selection of the optimum choke management strategy. Results indicate that the selection of the optimum strategy (sequence of choke settings) is independent of the drawdown and depends primarily on the duration of the ramp-up period. Among the 251 strategies evaluated, three of them consistently appear to be the optimum. We further refine strategies using a single parameter, incorporated in a dimensionless expression of BHP as a function of time. From simulation results, we conclude that for relatively short bean-up durations (i.e., infinite acting behavior), the pressure gradient reduction at the wellbore varies logarithmically with time. Choke management strategies appear to have similar performance as far as no more than 70% of the drawdown is applied during the initial 20% of the overall bean-up duration. For longer durations (i.e., when the presence of the no-flow boundary is felt), the optimum strategy depends on both reservoir properties and radial extent. For the case of square drainage area, a plot suggesting the optimum strategy with respect to dimensionless duration is presented. Positive skin and multiphase flow near the wellbore, negatively affect the performance of bean-up strategies. For vertical wells producing from multiple layers, bean-up strategies should be selected with respect to the effective horizontal permeability, ultimately yielding the greatest pressure gradient reduction in the low permeability zones. The proposed method enables engineers to select the optimum choke management strategy with respect to bean-up duration and formation properties. The duration of the bean-up process is drawdown dependent thus further research is encouraged in determining the maximum allowable pressure gradient in order to curtail sand production.

AB  - ABSTRACTIn field work recently conducted, it was revealed that there were no scale control measures in place because scale prediction conducted earlier had concluded that there was no scaling risk. However, a field survey later observed calcium carbonate deposits. In view of the inconsistency between theoretical prediction and field observations, another scale prediction study was conducted to understand the real field scaling potential.Carbonate scale prediction is more challenging due to the CO2 evolution and partitioning into all three (water/oil/gas) phases during production. This paper describes the scale prediction conducted at three different scenarios: (1) prediction without hydrocarbon, i.e., only water production during the calculation; (2) prediction with water and gas, i.e., gas production is considered; and (3) prediction with all three phases, i.e., the true replication of the production. The effect of pH was studied in detail during sensitivity runs. In addition, the effect of power oil on scaling potential is also investigated. It is well known that pH increase has a profound effect to prompt calcium carbonate scaling potential; a local increase in pH contributed to the solid deposition observed in field. The exclusion of the oil and gas phases in the previous modeling underestimated the real scaling risk. The carbonate scaling potential increases significantly when hydrocarbon was included into the calculation. The addition of power oil has little effect on the overall scaling potential in this case.This is a typical case in demonstrating that invalid scaling prediction can cause misinterpretation of true scale potential and therefore insufficient scale control resulting in scale buildup in field. This work highlights the importance of validity and reliability of data input into scale prediction software, in particular for carbonate scale prediction. It is essential to have a comprehensive understanding of reactions in all three phases, i.e., the total alkalinity and CO2 mass balance, to ensure an accurate prediction. Because CO2 can partition into all the three phases (water, oil and gas), compositional analysis for both oil and gas at the water sampling/analysis condition should be obtained before an accurate scale prediction can be made. Prediction results from any scale prediction software are only accurate if the input information is correct and sufficient. Without the complete information set, the scale prediction can only be treated as indicative. Field observations and deposit analysis should be incorporated into the consideration to evaluate the true likelihood and severity of the scale problem.INTRODUCTIONScale prediction software has been widely used in the industry to diagnose the scale type, location and severity. It is used as part of the scale control and management process to identify when and where there is scaling risk and how to best control it. There are several industrial recognized scale prediction software packages including Multiscale, Scalechem, ScaleSoftPitzer, which are all based on thermodynamic (rather than kinetic) equations. They are more reliable in predicting the type of scale, the likelihood of scale formation and the maximum scale amount, but they are not sensitive in identifying.

AB  - ABSTRACTA laboratory study of CaCO3 scaling kinetics has been undertaken to obtain information useful for prediction of CaCO3 scale formation. The induction time for precipitation has been determined in a series of experiments where SR, T and the ionic composition of the water from which precipitation occurs, have been varied. The effect of sand from a North Sea oilfield reservoir on the rate of CaCO3 precipitation has also been investigated. Our data shows that sand enhances the rate and reduces the induction time for calcite precipitation. The formation of solid CaCO3 has a window of metastability, which can vary from SR - aca2+ ac°#- = 7.0, Ksp(CaCQ) 2.9 and 2.7 at 80, 100 and 120°C, respectively, with no sand in the water, and 4.8-4.9, 2.7 and 2.6 with sand present. An even more drastic effect was observed when calcite scale was added to the water. At 100-120°C the precipitation at SR - 1.6 was observed after a few seconds. This is reasonable since the calcite crystals suspended in the solution act as crystallization sites for the dissolved carbonate. It was also observed that Mg 2÷ and SO42 ions in the solution increased the induction time and retarded the CaCO3 crystallization. This implies that compounds that block active sites for calcite crystallization may inhibit CaCO3 precipitation. With Mg 2+ and SO42- ions in the solution aragonite was formed. At constant SR ,., 2+/,., 2+ the activity ratio aMg /ctCa was found to have a different effect on the induction time as the Ca 2+ concentration was varied. The induction time for precipitation increased linearly with the probability that a magnesium ion was next to a calcium ion at constant SR. This probability is 2+ proportional to the concentration product mMg 2+, mca . INTRODUCTIONMineral precipitation or mineral scaling, during oil production is of considerable concern for the oil industry. Calcium carbonate is one of the most common of the various minerals precipitating from formation waters. Calcium carbonate can decrease the permeability in the near well area, adhere to the inside of the production tubing, and clog valves and other equipment. All of these will lead to a loss in production. Calcite scale is relatively easy to treat, since it is soluble in acids. The pressure drops as oil and water are produced from the reservoir. This pressure drop may lead to increasing supersaturation of CaCO3 and higher risk of calcite precipitation and the formation of scale. The supersaturation of CaCO3 can be calculated using thermodynamic models and oil and water analysis data. CaCO3 can, however, at rather high supersaturation, be in a metastable state in the solution. It will therefore not precipitate despite being thermodynamically unstable. When assessing whether CaCO3 scaling will be a problem, the kinetics of its formation ought to be taken into account. The induction time for precipitation is according to Mullin ~ defined as the time from supersaturation is created until critical nuclei for crystal growth are formed. However, if the induction time for a given supersaturation is longer than the retention time of the oil and water in the production tubing, scale might not form. The aim of this study has been to find the induction time for a given supersaturation at various conditions that can contribute to scale formation. Temperature, pressure, the ionic composition of the water phase, sand in the water and the flow rate are important parameters. The change in pH of the solution has been used to measure the experimental induction time at 80, 100 and 120°C. Experiments have been run with and without sand suspended in the solution by stirring. The sand was from two oil reservoirs in the North Sea. The effect of Mg 2+ and SO42 ions on

AB  - SummaryThe success of a primary cement job is often measured according to effectivezonal isolation, achieving the designed top of cement, and avoidance ofremedial cementing. In the San Juan and Rio Arriba counties of New Mexico, manyMesa Verde and Dakota wells are air-drilled because the Mesa Verde formation issubnormally pressured and naturally fractured.This combination makes theMesa Verde easy to hydraulically fracture during normal drilling and cementingoperations.Therefore, meeting the primary-cement-job success criteria isparticularly challenging.Cementing of casing within an air-drilled wellbore allows the slurry to freefall.Cement free fall can cause severe surge pressures at the bottom ofthe hole, leading to hydraulic fracture initiation and loss of lift.Theuse of a downhole choke (DHC) can be employed to prevent these processes fromoccurring.Because mud filter cake does not exist in an air-drilled hole, the leadwater spacer and cement must wet the casing and wellbore rocksurfaces.Loss of the lead water spacer, in conjunction with cement waterloss, can produce dehydration of the cement column, leading to an increase incement viscosity and equivalent circulating density.Careful control ofcement-free water and fluid loss are required to prevent this fromoccurring.Furthermore, placing cement across targeted completionintervals that have low fracture gradients requires the use of ahigh-compressive-strength, low-density cement that is competent and capable ofmaintaining zonal isolation during the completion and production phases of wellconstruction.This paper will outline the evolution of the cementing practices used forthe Mesa Verde and Dakota wells drilled in the 29-6 Unit (T29N - R6W, NewMexico) from 1998 to 2002.It will illustrate how cementing changesenabled the primary cementing to be successfully completed in a single stageinstead of two, which has translated into cost savings for both the drillingand completion phases of a well. The impact of using a DHC for the pumping andplacement of these primary cement jobs will be illustrated and discussed.The function of the cement additives on slurry properties will also bediscussed as they pertain to these cement jobs.IntroductionThe Mesa Verde and Dakota formations of the San Juan and Rio Arriba countiesof New Mexico are two of the primary completion targets for this area of theSan Juan basin.Fig. 1 shows a 500-square-mile view of the "Four Corners"area of the U.S.A., with the San Juan and Rio Arriba counties identified.Fig. 2 is a stratigraphic column of the San Juan basin.It illustratesthe Dakota and Mesa Verde formations, along with other productiveformations.The Dakota group is composed of a series of Cretaceouslenticular sandstones and shales.The nomenclature and designation of theindividual layers vary and are beyond the scope of this paper.The Dakotaformation is found at depths ranging between 7,000 and 8,000 ft, currentlymaking it the deepest productive interval in the San Juan basin.The MesaVerde group can be located at depths ranging between 4,500 and 6,500 ft and isalso composed of a series of Cretaceous formations.These consist of thePoint Lookout, Menefee, and Cliffhouse, from deepest to shallowest deposition,respectively.The Mesa Verde represents a group of subnormally pressuredreservoirs with original gradients having been measured at approximately 0.25psi/ft.However, continued pressure depletion of the Mesa Verde hasresulted in a reservoir gradient less than 0.15 psi/ft in most areas of the SanJuan basin.1Because of the low pressure gradients associated with the Mesa Verdeformations, it has become a standard practice of many operators to useair-drilling techniques.2 These techniques use compressed air, natural gas, ornitrogen as the drilling fluid to dramatically reduce the hydrostatic-head andequivalent-circulating density. While this practice eliminates the concernsover lost circulation during drilling, it can pose significant challenges toachieving a successful primary cement job. A successful primary cement job isoften measured according to effective zonal isolation, achieving the designedtop of cement, and avoidance of remedial cementing.This paper will discuss the challenges of achieving a successful primarycement job on an air-drilled well and how to design a lightweight cement slurryand casing configuration—inclusive of a DHC—to achieve a successful primarycement job.The experiences and evolution of a consecutive 6-year drillingprogram that produced 112 Mesa Verde and Mesa Verde/Dakota wells serves as thefoundation for support for these designs.However, for illustrationpurposes, the scope of this paper will be limited to the evolution of thesepractices on the 40 Mesa Verde and Mesa Verde/Dakota wells drilled in the 29-6Unit from 1998 through 2002.Fig. 3 is an aerial map of these welllocations in the 29-6 Unit.It shows the study wells to be distributedover 23 of the 36 sections within the 29-6 Unit.The 29-6 Unit was chosenbecause it exhibits the lowest fracture gradients in the Mesa Verde and wasconsidered the worst-case scenario for achieving a successful primary cementjob on the production string of casing.

AB  - SummaryIn a recent study,1 it was shown that the ratio of the flow rates of the produced fluids in an immiscible displacement can be used to identify geometrical and petrophysical characteristics of a reservoir. In this paper, we develop an extended version of this approach and apply it to displacements in 1D laboratory cores. Because of the possible importance of capillary effects, we derive asymptotic theories for the time dependence of the produced fluid ratio in the limits where capillary is negligible and where it dominates, respectively. Attention is paid to the capillary end effect at the outlet and to late times.It is shown that the exponent in the power-law dependence of the relative permeability to saturation, near its residual value, can be determined from a segment of the curve of the outlet fractional flow sometime after breakthrough. The asymptotic predictions are verified by obtaining an analytical solution to the full problem, including end effects, for a model case corresponding to Burgers' equation. Solutions are obtained for both drainage and imbibition. Experimental results for the high-rate displacement of some gas/liquids pairs are then reported. In agreement with the theoretical predictions, a power-law segment in the outlet fractional flow curve can be identified before capillary effects set in. The exponents obtained are discussed in terms of pore-scale models for gas/liquid displacement.IntroductionRelative permeabilities are important functions for the modeling and prediction of the recovery of fluids from porous media. They express integrated information on the pore-structure topology and geometry and on the pore occupancy by the corresponding fluids. Of particular interest is their dependence near the endpoint saturations (corresponding to residual or trapped fluids), where a power-law behavior is expected. Sensitivity studies using numerical simulation have shown that this behavior has the most important effect on recovery rates. Reflecting the same fact, most of the empirical models used (e.g., Corey, see Bear2 ) contain a power law in the residual saturation region. From theoretical considerations, this power-law dependence reflects two different mechanisms; first, the trapping of a disconnected nonwetting phase where film flow is absent, in the case of imbibition, and second, the continuous drainage of a wetting phase, through film flow, in the case of drainage. In the latter case, the residual saturation is theoretically zero.The trapping of a nonwetting phase by capillarity can be described by percolation theory and its extensions, such as invasion percolation3 and gradient percolation.4 Percolation theory predicts that the approach of various functions near the trapped saturation satisfies a power law with universal exponents, independent of the local pore structure. For example, Wilkinson5 showed that the relative permeability of the displaced phase, krd, near the trapping threshold in a random medium obeys the scalingEquation 1where S=the displaced phase saturation and r denotes trapped. The important parameter in Eq. 1 is the exponent b, which, in percolation approaches, depends only on the dimensionality of the pore network through the relationEquation 2Here, µ=the conductivity exponent and ß=the percolation exponent, both of which are dimension-dependent. For example, in 3D we have µ˜2, ß=0.45, and therefore b=1.38.The preceding analysis applies under the assumption that the displaced phase is nonwetting, and thus becomes trapped by capillary forces. However, if the displaced phase is wetting, it can escape through film flow. Now, the drainage of the wetting phase will continue, albeit at low rates. Film flow occurs either in the form of thick films and corner (or pocket) flows or through continuous thin films. The residual saturation will ultimately vanish, in which case the exponent of the relative permeability curve will be different from that for drainage. Theoretical results for the dependence of the relative permeability of the wetting phase under conditions of film flow were obtained by de Gennes,6 Novy,7 and Toledo.8 In the thick-film flow regime, de Gennes' theory predicts an exponent of the formEquation 3where D=the fractal dimension of the pore surface. For values of D in the order of 2 to 2.5, one obtains estimates for b in the range 3 to 5. The theory was based on the assumption of parallel pores. If the flow is controlled by thin films, the power-law exponent is additionally related to the power m of the dependence of the disjoining pressure ? on the film thickness h [namely ?(h)~h-m ], through the relationEquation 4(see Toledo et al.8). For values of D on the order of 2.3 to 2.6 and m=1/2, one obtains estimates for b in the range 8.4 to 16.8. These values are significantly higher and different than for drainage.The experimental determination of the relative permeability functions, including their behavior near the trapped saturation, is usually done using steady- or unsteady-state displacements. The well-known JBN technique9 provides information on the relative permeabilities in a region of saturation values after breakthrough of the injected fluid. It is based on an analysis of fluid rate production data and of the pressure drop across the sample, using the classical Buckley-Leverett equation.10 In general, however, the method is most accurate away from trapped saturations, where relative permeabilities are not too small.

AB  - Abstract Primary and secondary oil recovery from naturally fractured carbonate reservoirs with an oil-wet matrix is very low. Enhanced oil recovery from these reservoirs using surfactants to alter the wettability and reduce the interfacial tension have been extensively studied for many years, but there are still many questions about the process mechanisms, surfactant selection and testing, experimental design and most importantly how to scale up the lab results to the field. We have conducted a series of imbibition experiments using cores with different vertical and horizontal dimensions to better understand how to scale up the process. There was a particular need to perform experiments with larger horizontal dimensions since almost all previous experiments have been done in cores with a small diameter, typically 3.8 cm. We adapted and modified the experimental method used for traditional static imbibition experiments by flushing out fluids surrounding the cores periodically to better estimate the oil recovery, including the significant amount of oil produced as an emulsion. We used microemulsion phase behavior tests to develop high performance surfactant formulations for the oils used in this study. These surfactants gave ultra-low IFT at optimum salinity and good aqueous stability. Although we used ultra-low IFT formulations for most of the experiments, we also performed tests at higher IFT for comparison. Even for the higher IFT experiments, the capillary pressure is very small compared to gravity and viscous pressure gradients. We also developed a simple analytical model to predict the oil recovery as a function of vertical and horizontal fracture spacing, rock properties and fluid properties. The model and experimental data are in good agreement considering the many simplifications made to derive the model. The scaling implied by the model is significantly different than traditional scaling groups in the literature.

AB  - AbstractA method has been developed to scale the experimental data of spontaneous water imbibition (cocurrent) for gas-liquid-rock systems. In this method, a dimensionless time has been defined with the effects of relative permeability, wettability, and gravity included. The definition was not empirical but based on a theoretical derivation. Using this dimensionless time, experimental data from spontaneous water imbibition in different rocks with different size, porosity, permeability, initial water saturation, interfacial tension, and wettability might be scaled. The scaling model proposed in this study for gas-liquid-rock systems was verified experimentally for different rocks (Berea, chalk, and graywacke from The Geysers) with significantly different properties; it was also verified experimentally at different initial water saturations in the same rock. The scaling results from this study demonstrated that the cocurrent spontaneous water imbibition in gas-liquid-rock systems could be scaled and predicted.IntroductionSpontaneous water imbibition is an important mechanism during water injection or aquifer invasion into highly fractured reservoirs. The amount and the rate of water imbibition from the fracture into the matrix by spontaneous imbibition are essential to the understanding of reservoir performance. The process of spontaneous water imbibition is controlled by the properties of the porous medium, fluids, and their interactions. These parameters are porosity, permeability, pore structure, matrix size and shape, boundary condition, fluid viscosity, initial water saturation, wettability, interfacial tension, relative permeability, and gravity. Li and Horne1 derived an equation to correlate the imbibition rate and the recovery by considering almost all these variables.Scaling spontaneous water imbibition is important to evaluate the production performance because so many factors are involved. In order to scale the experimental data successfully, it may be necessary to consider the effects of all the significant factors. Scaling has been investigated widely in oil-water systems but rarely in gas-liquid systems.It is difficult to scale the experimental data of spontaneous imbibition in gas-liquid systems. Ignoring the effects of relative permeability, wettability, and gravity in the dimensionless time might be the reason. Natural gas-liquid-rock systems are usually strongly liquid-wet. However this does not imply that there are no significant differences among different gas-liquid-rock systems in terms of wettability. Gravity may also play an important role in some cases.Dimensionless time used to scale spontaneous imbibition data is usually defined as follows (Ma et al.2):Equation 1where tD is the dimensionless time, k is the rock permeability, f is the porosity, s is the interfacial tension between oil and water, t is the imbibition time, µm is the geometric mean of water and oil viscosities and La is the characteristic length defined as follows:Equation 2awhere V is the bulk volume of the matrix, Ai is the area open to imbibition in the ith direction, and dai is the distance traveled by the imbibition front from the open surface to the no-flow boundary.

AB  - AbstractIf a glass electrode calibrated in aqueous pH standards is used to measure H+ concentration in aqueous glycol solutions the result will be in error due to the large change in solvent properties. Based on strong acid - strong base titrations in glycol solutions it is possible to calibrate glass electrodes. The titration does not only give the calibration constant for the electrode, but also the autoprotolysis constant for the solvent can be determined. The calibration method makes it possible to determine acid constants in glycol by potentiometric titration. IntroductionCo-production of formation water and water carry-over into gas/condensate pipelines may result in scaling. The problem is closely associated with hydrate control. For long distance transportation, high dose hydrate inhibitors like methanol and glycol have been chosen rather than external heating or low dose kinetic inhibitors. High dose inhibitors provide means for corrosion control and are easy to regenerate. Ethylene glycol is preferred from a corrosion point of view. It reduces corrosion by itself and can easily carry corrosion inhibitors. Carry-over of formation water may give scaling when glycol is used for hydrate and corrosion control. Ethylene glycol reduces the solubility of scale forming compounds as CaCO3, BaSO4 and SrSO4. Scale will rarely form when clean glycol is injected into a pipeline with limited amounts of formation water. The dilution of the formation water more than compensate for the reduction in solubility. However, depending on how the glycol is regenerated some formation brine will be recycled and accumulated until one or more compounds reach its solubility limit somewhere in the glycol loop. The scaling risk is enhanced further if the pH of the glycol is increased to reduce pipeline corrosion. Then solubility calculations and process control become critical to avoid precipitation of CaCO3.To be able to predict scaling and set operational limits for glycol loops, it is at least necessary to know the solubility of the mineral salts and of the most water soluble gases CO2 and H2S. To fill in the lacking data for glycol solutions, IFE has run research programs to measure solubility and dissociation constants in glycol system. Most of these equilibria depend on pH and exact pH measurements are a requirement both in laboratory experiments and for process control. A simplified method for calibration of pH electrodes in glycol solutions is presented together with correction terms for changes in electrode response due to ethylene glycol.TheorypH measurements in solutions with high glycol concentrations are not straightforward. A glass electrode calibrated in aqueous pH standards will be in error due to the large change in solvent properties. Some pH reference value standards (RVS) are available for monoethylene glycol (MEG)1, but they are difficult to use in practice as they refer to solutions with zero ionic strength. The standards use KHftatalate that are difficult to use with glass electrodes as it has low buffer capacity and slow glass electrode response. They are also limited to maximum 70wt% MEG. The pH is defined bypH = -log(aH) = -log(?HmH)(1)The pH is the negative logarithm to the H+ activity and the pH scale depends on the chosen reference state. Mussini et al. chose the pure MEG-water solutions at zero ionic strength as reference state for their RVS1. For most practical use, the concentration of H+ is needed rather than the pH. The proton concentration can be obtained if a correction factor for glass electrodes can be established. The correction factor can be determined by performing a titration of strong base with a strong acid.2TheorypH measurements in solutions with high glycol concentrations are not straightforward.

AB  - AbstractIn most heavy oil fields, steam is generated at large centralized plants and distributed through complex piping networks to numerous injection wells. Thornhill-Craver critical flow chokes are commonly used to control the steam rates to each injection well. Unfortunately, pressure loss across the chokes must exceed 40% to maintain critical flow conditions. Consequently, steam must be generated at a pressure greater than twice the required wellhead injection pressure.In theory, critical flow conditions can be achieved with tapered-bore chokes with only 10% to 20% pressure loss. Although straight-bore and tapered-bore chokes follow the same critical flow principles, the tapered-bore design allows for a more efficient means of controlling flow rate. One obvious advantage of using tapered-bore chokes is the reduced steam generation pressure required to achieve and maintain critical flow. The pressure upstream of the tapered-bore choke need only be about 1.2 times the downstream wellhead pressure.This paper examines the effectiveness of tapered-bore chokes for controlling steam rates, evaluates the accuracy of the Thornhill-Craver equation for calculating critical flow rates, and presents a set of practical guidelines and procedures for applying tapered-bore chokes to efficiently and cost- effectively control and monitor steam rates to injection wells.IntroductionControlling and monitoring steam flow to injection wells is an important element of steamflood reservoir management. Valves, nozzles, orifice plates and critical flow chokes are typically used to regulate steam flow. Of these devices, critical flow chokes have proven to be a very reliable and cost effective means of controlling wellhead steam rates.A Thornhill-Craver choke with a removable straight-bore bean insert, shown in Figure 1, is the most commonly used choke configuration. The choke assembly consists of a 2-inch cage nipple (or bean housing) threaded into a tee junction that is equipped with a hammer union for safe insertion and removal of the critical flow bean. The drain plug is typically replaced with a blowdown valve prior to installation in the steam line.Under critical flow conditions, steam flow rate depends only on upstream pressure, steam quality, and bean size. Hence, for a given steam quality, the flow rate can be controlled by setting the upstream pressure or the bean size. The main disadvantage of straight-bore chokes is the large pressure drop required. Hence, chokes are not typically used when the steam supply pressure is considered to be too low, or when the sandface injection pressure is considered to be too high, to establish and maintain critical flow conditions.In theory, tapered-bore chokes can be used in place of straight-bore chokes to achieve critical flow with considerably less pressure loss. A conventional Thornhill-Craver choke assembly is used, along with a tapered-bore bean insert, shown in Figure 2. Critical flow is achieved in the bean throat, but, the tapered exit section acts as a diffuser that promotes pressure recovery. Steam pressure exiting the choke can be as high as 80% to 85% of the upstream pressure.Critical Flow PrinciplesBy definition, critical flow of a compressible fluid occurs when the fluid reaches sonic velocity in the bean throat. A shock wave develops and the flow is said to be choked.P. 269

AB  - AbstractState-of-the-art completion technologies to more efficiently support the needs of the oilfield continue to be developed. For example, intelligent completion techniques, which are designed to allow the operator to reconfigure well architecture without well intervention, have gained a great deal of attention because of their capabilities to improve monitoring and overall well performance in multi-zone oil and gas field developments. In all of these multi-zone intelligent-well completions, flow adjusting and monitoring devices or interval control valves are located between zonal isolation packers to control flow into or out of each zone. The first generation of these interval control valves was a choke that offered only four positions. To overcome the position limitations, an infinitely variable choke has now been designed. The requirements for this next-generation interval control valve provided many design challenges. This paper describes the design, development and testing of a metal-to-metal sealing, infinitely variable downhole choke with true position sensing capability. All topics from the conceptual design and customer requirements to accelerated erosion testing and component life predictions will be discussed. Testing has verified that the new interval control valve can support the needs of the multi-zone well completion. This new technology has been installed in a Statoil water injection well.IntroductionThe development of a surface controlled reservoir analysis and management system (SCRAMS™ intelligent completion system) that would provide intelligent well capabilities began in 1994. The completion system was based on use of a permanently installed electrical network to transmit data and control a number of downhole well tools. Among the first downhole tools that were developed for use with the new system was the four-position interval control valve (ICV). With a limit of only four positions, the four-position ICV allowed for only full open, closed, and two intermediate choke positions. In addition to the limited choice of positions, the size of the flow ports for the intermediate choke positions had to be selected far enough in advance to allow time for manufacturing of the equipment.1Almost immediately, it was obvious that the four-position ICV's would not be adequate to fulfill the promise of the greatly enhanced well control that the new intelligent well concepts were capable of providing. As a solution, the idea for an infinitely variable interval control valve (IVICV) was conceived. The IVICV was a joint project between two service companies that based the choke requirements on intelligent well as well as operator needs. The valve that was subsequently developed was capable of addressing the need for a downhole fully adjustable choke that could be operated with a SCRAMS controlled sensor actuator module (SAM™ unit). Each zone of a multizone well can now have an individual sensor actuator module and an IVICV for adjustable flow control with pressure and temperature feedback to the surface. Fig. 1 is a schematic drawing of the IVICV.

AB  - ABSTRACTSevere scaling conditions exist in South Brae due to the high barium content of formation water and low pH downhole. Formation water is also susceptible to calium carbonate scaling. This paper presents experiences with control of scale on topsides and downhole during development of the field. A sulphonate-based inhibitor has been developed and app1ied for downhole control of BaS04. The benefits achieved by the use of d.s sulphated sea water to minimise the BaS04 potential are presented. The methods developed for controlling calcium carbonate scale are described. INTRODUCTIONThe deposition of mineral scale is a common problem in the oil industry, nowhere more so than in the North Sea (l-5). The type of scaling and its severity varies between fields, however, calcium carbonate and barium sulphate scaling are common problems. Calcium carbonate scaling can be problematic irrespective of injection water breakthrough whereas barium sulphate scaling is a problem due to co-production of formation water and incompatible injection water. Because of its insolubility and consequent difficulty in removing, barium sulphate is usually the more troublesome scale and its inhibition more critical. The barium content of most North Sea formation waters is in the range 10-200 mg/1. By comparison the Brae formation water is as high as 2500mg/1, This high barium content in conjunction with sea water injection presents a severe scale problem, compounded by the relatively low downhole pH. As a result, development of the South Brae field has necessitated development of special scale control procedures. Although similar highbarium levels have also been found in other North Sea fields, eg T Block (6), South Brae is the first such North Sea field to be developed. This paper presents an overview of the experience gained of the scale problem and the control measures developed, The South Brae field is located in block 16/7a of the UK sector of the North Sea. The reservoir and its geology has been described recently by Phillips (7). The field has been on production since 1983. Reservoir pressure maintenance and voidage has been achieved by a combination of down dip water injection and crestal gas injection. Injection of filtered sea water commenced in 1984. In 1988 the first phase of a 120,000 bbl capacity facility to reduce sulphate levels in seawater wasinstalled. From 1986 until 1990 the gas used for injection and gas lift purposes had the C02 content reduced from 32-35 mol% to 9-10% by a Selexol processing facility. In 1990 the Selexol plant was decommissioned and produced gas with a typical C02 content of 22 mol% has been used. Fluids are processed through twin, three-stage separation trains, each train having separate high pressure and medium pressure manifolds. Water is separated at the MP and LP separation stages. It is degassed and treated via flotation units prior to discharge. SCALINGPREDICTIONSFormation water composition Assessment of the scale potential was initially uncertain due to the large variation in the compositions evident in the limited number of formation water samples.

AB  - ABSTRACTA comprehensive methodology has been developed for predicting mineral scaling in oil and gas production environments. The methodology is based on a previously developed model for mixed-solvent electrolyte systems (MSE). The model relies on a detailed treatment of speciation in the liquid phase. It represents the standard-state properties of individual species using the Helgeson-Kirkham-Flowers equation of state and it predicts the species' activity coefficients on the basis of contributions that reflect long-range electrostatic, short-range ionic, and non-ionic interactions. The model has been designed to calculate phase equilibria in multicomponent systems containing an aqueous phase, multiple solid phases, a gas phase, and a second liquid (typically hydrocarbon-dominated) phase. With this formulation, the model is capable of predicting the formation of scales not only in aqueous systems but also in environments that contain nonaqueous additives such as methanol or mono-, di-, and triethylene glycols. The performance of the model has been analyzed for various solids including calcium sulfate, barium sulfate, calcium carbonate and magnesium carbonate as a function of temperature, brine composition, pressure and the presence of methanol and glycols. Additionally, the effects of metastability have been taken into account for scales that may occur in various crystalline forms.INTRODUCTIONThe formation of mineral scales is a common and expensive problem in the oil and gas industry. Accumulation of scales can lead to a reduction in well productivity, fouling of equipment, damage to pumps, and concealment of corrosion. The generation of multicomponent mineral scale deposits is controlled by multiple factors including the composition of reservoir water, temperature and pressure conditions, presence of sour gases, solids introduced during drilling, corrosion of the production string, etc. Therefore, there is a strong motivation for developing accurate modeling tools that can predict the likelihood of scale formation, the chemical identity of precipitating solids and the degree of supersaturation as a function of production conditions.The main difficulty in modeling scaling lies in the behavior of multicomponent mixtures. While the solubility and precipitation characteristics of individual solids are typically known, the presence of other components can results in significantly altered and sometimes counterintuitive behavior. The scaling behavior is also complicated by the metastability of some solid phases. Also, the presence of nonelectrolytes such as methanol and glycols can greatly alter the precipitation behavior of salts when such components are introduced as hydrate inhibitors in the transportation of produced hydrocarbons and water. To address these problems, a tremendous amount of experimental data has been published in the literature, thus creating a rich database that can be used to develop thermodynamic models.The objective of this study is to develop a model that can accurately predict the formation of mineral scales in multicomponent aqueous systems in the absence and presence of methanol and glycols. For this purpose, we apply a previously developed thermodynamic framework1-3 to develop a detailed treatment of the solution chemistry and phase behavior of Na - K - Mg - Ca - Ba - Fe - Cl - SO4 - CO3 - S - H2O - methanol - glycol systems.

AB  - Abstract Dynamic scale loop tests are one of the major test methods used in the oilfield scale industry to evaluate the minimum inhibitor concentration (MIC) performance of scale inhibitors under laminar flow conditions. However, this laminar flow condition may not often be representative of field flow conditions especially around chokes, downhole safety valves and in wells with ESP and ICD completions where the flow is turbulent. Under these turbulent flow conditions the MIC derived by standard dynamic loop test may be too low to inhibit scale formation and very seldom has focus been placed on the effect of turbulence on MIC of scale inhibitors. It is possible to modify existing dynamic scale loop equipment to achieve turbulent flow conditions. However, the turbulent flow conditions imparted by the higher flow rate and narrow test coils still cannot match the really high Reynolds numbers experienced in real field conditions so a different approach was adopted to more closely replicate field conditions. This consisted of installing an adjustable small bore valve in the dynamic loop rig which closely simulates the turbulent environment around chokes and downhole safety valves. This new methodology and testing under turbulent and laminar conditions (at lower Reynolds numbers) was used to gain an understanding of the impact of flow on scale deposition and MIC and this information was used to design and identify new environmentally friendly P containing scale squeeze inhibitors that demonstrated excellent performance under turbulent flow conditions. This paper will give a comprehensive study of the effect of flow condition on the scale formation and inhibition and, in addition, will detail how this methodology and new chemistry can be coupled to a chemical technology toolbox, that also implements techniques for advanced scale inhibitor analysis and improved scale inhibitor retention, to design optimum scale squeeze packages for harsh scaling conditions. Introduction Scale is often defined as deposits of insoluble inorganic minerals, such as CaCO3, BaSO4, and CaSO4 etc. The formation of mineral scale is a persistent and expensive problem in oil and gas production. Scaling of metallic or insulating walls in contact with hard water may create technical problems including pipe or valve blockage, under-deposit corrosion, and even more importantly, unscheduled equipment shutdown1. The bulk precipitation and surface deposition of scale has been widely studied and reported in literature because of its importance during oil and gas production. Traditionally, the study of scale formation has concentrated in the bulk solution by using laboratory beaker tests2 under static conditions; either turbidity probes or bulk chemical analysis have been used to analyze kinetics of precipitation. In addition, static tests cannot be pressurized and heated up to field conditions, especially for the scale deposition in HTHP wells.

AB  - AbstractA design of chokes in series has been carried out in order to minimize sand erosion in choke boxes and beams. A multiphase flow simulation program was developed to determine the size of the choke orifices and the sequence of installation. Previous field experience determined beneficial effect of using chokes coated in their internal area from end to end with tungsten carbide.Failures in choke boxes and beams have been occurring in about 59 out of the 222 production strings in the North of Monagas area in Venezuela to the present time. In fact, 139 failures due to sand erosion occurred during 1996 causing repair costs of about $339000.The installation of a design consisting of chokes in series at the well head, drastically minimizes sand erosion, reducing production losses, oil leaks, maintenance costs and unsafe operations.The multiphase flow simulation program based design resulted in the installation of three chokes in series protecting them from sand erosion in the two wells evaluated. During five (5) months, the pre-established period of time for analysis, well No. 1 kept producing continuously. Visual inspection confirmed that no sand erosion had occurred in any of the chokes.IntroductionHigh gas and oil rates associated to sand production with high well head pressures passing through one choke box with conventional material usually causes erosion of the beam and its choke box; the severity of the erosion process may deteriorate them completely, giving place to leaks. Sand production erodes the internal parts of a well head including wing valves, tees, subsurface safety valves, choke boxes and beams affecting the well safety system and production operations. These accessories are inspected periodically, and frequently, they have to be repaired or replaced. This type of failure causes deferred production and dedication of production crews to correct erosion problems affecting operational costs.Research has been carried out on the erosive processes in materials with and without the presence of sand. In the oil industry, an API formula has been developed to predict the limit velocity for flow of fluids, above which an erosive process, in non corrosive environments and without the presence of solid particles, can be initiated. Deffenbaugh showed results on the erosion velocity for carbon steels excluding its application for flow restrictions as chokes. Likewise, Deffenbaugh proposed a formula to predict erosion velocity in the presence of sand. Sontvedt reported the limit velocities for erosion for carbon steels in the absence of corrosive fluids based upon studies of materials for chokes, and also for other special materials resistant to erosion.

AB  - Summary Flow-rate prediction of oil production wells is of prime importance to effectively confront high-water-cut and separator problems. (Semi-) empirical multiphase-flow correlations are proved quite useful for this purpose. This work presents new generalized multiphase flow choke correlation, derived on the basis of actual production data from horizontal and vertical wells from an oil field in Iran. The newly established correlation predicts liquid flow rates as a function of flowing wellhead pressure, gas/liquid ratio, surface wellhead choke size, and the newly incorporated parameters: basic sediment and water (BS&W) and temperature. To evaluate the influence of these two new parameters, a parameter-sensitivity analysis was performed and the results are shown. This proposed correlation exhibited an average error of roughly 2.89%, which is superior to those previous correlations in the literature that did not use these two newly incorporated parameters (BS&W and temperature). These new parameters can be added to the previous correlations when the water cut and temperature become important in the production history of the wells. Introduction The phenomenon of multiphase flow (liquid and gas) happens in the wellhead of the majority of the producing wells. As the regulation of the flow rate becomes important during the production period in the producing wells, chokes are used for isolating the underground reservoir from pressure variations in the surface equipment, and also they are used for preventing or reducing the water production. Larger amounts of produced water from oil recovery result in increasing of operating costs and are a major environmental concern for oil production (Jin and Wojtanowicz 2010). Although numerous multiphase-flow correlations are included in the literature (Al-Attar 2010), almost all of them are limited to a special operational condition in which the correlations are driven. As a result, the strength of those correlations for predicting the actual flow rate is restricted. Gilbert (1954) developed the most popular multiphase flow surface choke correlation, but this correlation is valid for the critical flow condition when the upstream pressure of the choke is 70% or more higher than the downstream pressure (Ghareeb and Shedid 2007). Flow through the wellhead chokes is mainly divided into two critical and subcritical conditions. Within this manuscript, the critical-flow condition refers to the state at which the flow rate reaches a maximum amount independent of the downstream and upstream pressure difference of the choke. Empirical correlations are mainly used for critical-flow condition.

AB  - AbstractCarbonate or sulphate scaling is usually mitigated by using chemical inhibitors that alter the growth mode of the scale mineral, but with halite scaling the apparent absence of a suitable inhibitor has meant that periodic removal with low-salinity water has been favoured. We report laboratory testing and the first field application of a chemical inhibitor for halite scaling. The inhibitor was field-tested in the Leman gas field (North Sea), where halite scaling occurs in gas-compression equipment due to evaporation of water from brine droplets carried over from the gas-water separator. The scale reduces the efficiency of both compressor and cooler, necessitating regular costly cleaning of the internals. After a recent system clean out, the cheap, non-toxic halite inhibitor was dosed continuously for 3 months into the production stream downstream of the gas-water separator. Whilst halite deposition was not completely suppressed, an increase in compressor efficiency was observed for all compression stages compared with recent non-inhibited data. A significant improvement in gas-cooler efficiency and a reduced tendency to block gas-flow meters, were also observed. This indicates that the inhibitor has considerable potential for cost-effective control of halite scaling, possibly as an alternative to periodic removal or in combination with it.IntroductionScale deposition is a widespread problem that causes production deferment, necessitates costly intervention, and can also compromise safety systems. It can be particularly severe when highly saline (typically>200,000 mg/litre) or even salt-saturated formation water is involved, because of the potential to generate large quantities of halite scale (rock salt, NaCl), normally by evaporation of water into the gas phase. Although halite deposits tend to be easier to remove than most other scales - most commonly by periodic washing with low-salinity water -, the rate of build-up can be orders of magnitude greater,1 and thus very frequent intervention may be required to limit hydrocarbon deferment and prevent equipment malfunction.2Unlike carbonate and sulphate scales, which can be controlled by the use of threshold inhibitors that influence crystal nucleation and/or growth, preventing the build-up of halite scale has only been achieved by continuous dilution of the fluid stream with water upstream of where deposition occurs. Whilst successful, this can require significant amounts of low-salinity water to be available, which preferably is chemically compatible with the produced water and has been deoxygenated to limit corrosion. Sea water is often unsuitable without addition of large amounts of inhibitor chemicals against sulphate scale, because high-salinity formation waters frequently contain extreme levels of barium, strontium and calcium ions, and are hence highly incompatible with the high concentration of sulphate in sea water.3 Moreover, the introduction of even small amounts of additional liquid can be highly detrimental to the performance of some equipment, such as gas compressors.

AB  - This article, written by Technology Editor Dennis Denney, contains highlights of paper SPE 109165, "Technical Breakthrough in PCPs' Scaling Issue of ASP Flooding in Daqing Oil Field," by Cao Gang, SPE, and Liu He, SPE, University of Science and Technology of China, and Shi Guochen, SPE, Wang Guoqing, Xiu Zhongwen, Ren Huaifeng, SPE, and Zhang Ying, Daqing Oilfield Company, prepared for the 2007 SPE Annual Technical Conference and Exhibition, Anaheim, California, 11-14 November. The alkaline/surfactant/polymer (ASP) –flooding pilot tests in Daqing oil field commenced in 1982. Although the recovery rate can be improved by 20%over that with waterflooding, severe scaling formed in downhole equipment and in artificial-lift systems of ASP producers. Sucker-rod failure was extremely high for beam-pumping wells. The running life for progressing-cavity-pump (PCP) systems was longer but still not economical. Severe scaling on the surface of the pump and string was the major factor causing drastic oscillation of operating load. Stator-surface modification and fluid treatments increased the average running life from several months to longer than 1 year. Introduction ASP-flooding pilot tests commenced after waterflooding and indicated that the recovery rate was improved by 20% on average. However, a negative issue emerged: Severe scaling formed on the surface of production systems and resulted in abnormal operation. In beam-pumping systems, when scaling particles dropped out and accumulated in the space between pump barrel and piston, the pump would be blocked in a short period. The minimum running life was less than 1 month. In electrical-submersible-pump systems, the main problem was motor failures resulting from separators being blocked by scaling. The shortest running life was 1/2 month. The structure of PCPs resulted in a failure rate much lower than that of the other lifting methods. The average running life was approximately 3 months. Fig. 1 shows some of the pump and rod abrasion problems. PCP-Scaling Mechanism In the process of ASP flooding, alkaline lye reacts with rock minerals and formation water, increasing scaling-ions concentration (e.g., Ca2+, CO32−, SiO23−) in the formation. As production fluid moved close to or into the wells, the change of temperature and pressure breaks the balance of scaling ions and scaling forms near the wellbore, on the surface of downhole equipment, and on the inner surface of tubulars. The study indicated that ASP scaling is a mixture of carbonate and silicate. The main mineralogical compositions are amorphous-state silicon dioxide, hexagonal-spherical calcite, and conventional calcite. Minor mineralogical compositions are clastic quartz, clastic feldspar, clastic clay particles, and pyrite. The hardness of silicate is much higher than that of chromium coating, causing rotor-coating wear after a short period.  Rod Fatigue. PCP-well operating loads in the ASP-flooding area were less stable than in other areas. Severe oscillation of the operating load resulted in a high rod-fatigue-failure rate in PCP wells in the ASP-flooding area. A study indicated that rod-fatigue failure resulted from the comprehensive influence of several factors.

AB  - The PDF file of this paper is in Russian.   During operation of the electric centrifugal pump, a gas-oil mixture accumulates above its suction eyes. As the temperature rises, the pressure decreases to saturation pressure, and the pump is surrounded by gas bubbles that are in dynamic equilibrium with the layers of oil upflow and downflow. The centrifugal pump efficiency depends mainly on the content of free gas bubbles in the mixture. On model liquids it is shown that with an air-to-oil content of 5%, the pump efficiency can be reduced by 25 - 30%. Pump starvation happens at higher gas content in the mixture. Excessive temperature rise in the pump results in the boiling of the formation water inside it. At low pump intake pressure the boiling point of water can be 120-150°C, as the pressure at the pump intake increases, the water boiling temperature also increases. Changes in pressure and the corresponding water boiling temperature are the reason for the beginning of the process of deposition of salts - scale in the internal cavity of the pump. During electric centrifugal pump well operation the pressure at the pump intake decreases, which leads to an increase in the content of free gas in the gas-liquid mixture. The increase in gas content causes a pump efficiency decrease, which in turn causes an increase in its temperature. If, at the same time, the boiling temperature of the produced water is equal to or less than the temperature of the pump, then the process of its boiling will begin in the cavity of the pump. By adjusting the pressure at the electric centrifugal pump intake, it is possible to avoid boiling of the formation water and, consequently, salt deposits in the cavity of the pump.   В процессе эксплуатации электроцентробежного насоса (ЭЦН) выше его приемных отверстий накапливается газонефтяная смесь. При повышении температуры давление снижается до давления насыщения, и насос оказывается окруженным газовыми пузырьками, которые находятся в динамическом равновесии со слоями восходящих и нисходящих потоков нефти. Коэффициент полезного действия (к.п.д.) центробежного насоса в основном зависит от содержания свободных газовых пузырьков в смеси. На модельных жидкостях показано, что при содержании воздуха в масле, равном 5 %, к.п.д. насоса может уменьшиться на 25 – 30 %. При более высоком содержании газа в смеси происходит срыв подач. Чрезмерное повышение температуры в насосе приводит к кипению пластовой воды внутри него. При низких давлениях на приеме насоса температура кипения воды может составлять 120 – 150 °С, с увеличением давления на приеме насоса возрастает и температура кипения воды. Изменения давления и соответствующей ему температуры кипения воды являются причиной начала процесса отложения солей – накипи во внутренней полости насоса. При эксплуатации скважины ЭЦН давление на приеме насоса снижается, что приводит к увеличению содержания свободного газа в газожидкостной смеси. Увеличение газосодержания обусловливает снижение к.п.д. насоса, что в свою очередь вызывает рост его температуры. Если при этом температура кипения попутно добываемой воды равна или меньше температуры насоса, то в полости насоса начнется процесс ее кипения. Регулируя давление на приеме ЭЦН можно избежать кипения пластовой воды и, следовательно, отложения солей в полости насоса.

AB  - AbstractSeveral correlations of critical and subcritical two-phase flow through wellhead chokes were evaluated to test their application to Middle East oil fields. Two groups of correlations describing two-phase flow through wellhead chokes were examined. The first group involved simple empirical equations similar to those of Gilbert(1). Two new correlations were proposed: one for critical and the other for subcritical flow regimes. The second group comprised derived equations of two-phase flow incorporating PVT properties. PVT correlations developed for the Middle East crudes were employed. These correlations were tested for a wide range of field data obtained from several Middle East countries.Selection of the best correlation was justified by statistical error analysis, range of validity, and number of involved variables to be measured in the field. Our simple version of correlations provided more accurate results than any other correlation involving the same variables. Incorporation of the PVT correlations for produced fluid properties of the Middle East oil fields improved the accuracy of the derived models.The developed correlations were useful for accurate prediction of choke performance of the Middle East oil wells. The proposed empirical correlations are applicable for various types of reservoir fluids, including black oil, volatile oil, and gas condensate fluids. These correlations do not require knowledge of PVT properties of the produced fluids.IntroductionChokes are commonly used in oil and gas production systems. A choke is a restriction basically designed to control flow rates of oil and gas wells, to impose a back pressure on the formation protecting it from damage, to prevent the downstream disturbances from propagating upstream (critical flow), and to protect the surface equipment facilities against slugging at high flowing pressures.Several approaches have been suggested for the prediction of multiphase flow through chokes. These approaches can be classified into four groups. The first group consists of correlations similar to the one originally proposed by Gilbert(1). This equation has been further modified by Ros(2), Secen(3), Baxendell(4), Achong(5), Pilehvari(6), and Osman and Dokla(7). These correlations were developed for the critical flow regime. In such correlations, the PVT properties of the produced fluids were neglected. Some of these correlations are claimed to be valid for downstream to upstream pressure ratios up to 0.7(1).The second group combines the empirical correlations for critical flow through chokes with fluid properties. The correlations belonging to this group include Poettmann and Beck(8), Al-Attar and Abdul-Majeed(9), and Al-Towailib and Al-Marhoun(10). Poettmann and Beck(8) converted Ros's correlation to graphical forms for 20, 30, and 40 ° API crudes. These correlations are restricted to critical two-phase flow of wells producing clean oil. Al-Attar and Abdul-Majeed(9) modified Gilbert's(1) equation by including the API gravity of the crude oil. However, they recommended the use of more field data to test their correlation. Al- Towailib and Al-Marhoun(10) introduced the effect of gas-oil mixture density into an empirical correlation that describes fluid flow in chokes. This correlation is limited for critical flow, neglects solution GOR, and requires knowledge of the specific gravity of the produced gas and oil.

AB  - AbstractProperty scaling becomes an issue whenever heterogeneous media properties are measured at one scale but applied at another (i.e.. data is collected at the core scale but analysis is conducted at the grid block scale). A research program has been established to challenge current understanding of property scaling with the aim of developing and testing models that describe scaling behavior in a quantitative manner. Scaling of constitutive rock properties is investigated through physical experimentation involving the collection of gas-permeability data measured over a range of discrete scales. The approach is to systematically isolate those factors that influence property scaling and investigate their relative contributions to overall scaling behavior. Two blocks of rock, each exhibiting differing heterogeneity structure, have recently been examined. The two samples were found to yield different scaling behavior, as exhibited by changes in the distribution functions and semi-variograms. Simple models have been fit to the measured scaling behavior that are of similar functional form but of different magnitude.IntroductionNumerical simulation aimed at evaluating the production characteristics of an economic reservoir require detailed information on the geology and material properties of the reservoir. The acquisition of such information through reservoir characterization is complicated by the fact that many of the important hydraulic, chemical, thermal and mechanical properties are measured at scales (as limited by current technology) much smaller than can be accommodated in current reservoir simulators (as limited by computation time). In many cases the discrepancy between the measurement and analysis scales is many orders of magnitude on a per volume basis (cm3 to km3). It is well established that many properties, particularly constitutive properties. are scale dependent. That is, as the scale of measurement is increased, changes in the distribution function and semi-variogram are realized. For this reason scaling models are required for transforming information (i.e., distribution function and semi-variogram, which represent the key input to 1-, 2-, and 3-D reservoir property models) from the scale of the available data to the scale at which simulations will ultimately be performed. This raises such questions as:do rock properties scale in a predictable and quantifiable manner;if so, what is the nature of the scaling behavior;how does property heterogeneity influence scaling behavior; andhow should the characterization of scaling behavior be approached?A number of theories, representing a wide diversity of approaches, have been proposed for "scaling-up" measurements; however, physical data to support these theoretical models are sparse and limited in scope. For this reason, a research program founded on systematic physical experimentation has been established to challenge current understanding of property-scaling behavior. The experimental program involves the collection of gas permeability data at a number of discrete measurement scales, thereby providing a direct means of investigating scaling behavior. Factors influencing scaling behavior (i.e., heterogeneity structure, characteristics of the sampling and analysis program) are varied in a systematic fashion to isolate relative contributions to overall scaling behavior. The data are used to explore potential empirical scaling relationships and directly challenge existing scaling theory.P. 947^

AB  - AbstractThe predictive accuracy of eight critical two-phase flow correlations aretested against field measured production data, from 210 well tests, coveringbroad range of production rates, choke sizes, upstream pressures, gas-liquidratios and oil API gravities. Test data are divided into four selectedcategories based on choke size ( D ) : D < 6, 6 &le D < 10,10 &le D < 30 and D &ge 30/64.The correlations included in this study are those of Gilbert , Ros , Baxendall, Achonge, Poettmann-Beck, Omana, Ashford and Hazim-Ghassan.The average percent error, absolute average percent error, and standarddeviation are computed for each correlation. Due to inconsistency of resultsobtained by the included correlations, the multiple regression analysis is usedto find out correlations that best fit the measured data, as a result, four newcorrelations are developed (a correlation for each data category).Based on the statistical results, the new correlations clearly outperformed theremaining correlations.IntroductionSeveral correlations have been published for describing critical two - phaseflow through wellhead chokes. Most of these correlations were based on limitedranges of flow variables. Their validity is limited by the quality and scope ofthe data upon which they are based.The objectives of this study are:To indicate the accuracy of the existing critical flow correlations.To modify the existing correlations if necessary or develop newcorrelations that best fit the measured data.The correlations compared are those of Gilbert1, Ros2,Baxendall3,Achonge4,Poettmann Beck5,Omana6, Ashford7 and Hazim-Ghassan8. Some ofthe correlations require values of fluid physical properties, the following PVTcorrelations are used to estimate them :Well Test DataFifty six tests from Iraq wells, 108 from Poettmann's study, 27 from Ashford'sstudy and 37 from Omana's study are combined in a data bank for thisinvestigation.Each of the well tests is examined for unreasonable values by comparing themeasured production rates for a well test with the production rates predictedby all correlations. As a result, eighteen well tests are removed The existingrevised bank now contains 210 well tests. The ranges of flow variables coveredby the well data are given in Table 1. CorrelationsThe final equations of the compared correlations are given below ( a detailedanalysis If the correlations may be found in the original sources in thereferences)Gilbert, Ros, Baxendall, Achong CorrelationsThe equations proposed by Gilbert, Ros, Baxendall and Achong, are all of theform:Equations (available in full paper)It is very important to use the absolute average percent error (AAPE) as a baseof comparison instead of average percent error (APE), because when the laterused, the negative errors cancel the positive errors and thus the APE willappear small. Using the AAPE removes this cancelling effect by transforming allnegative error to equal magnitude positive errors. This is illustrated in Fig.1.

AB  - AbstractAccurate prediction of multi-phase flow through chokes is required formodern production design and optimization of oil well performance. Most of theMiddle-East oil wells are uniquely characterized with high production rates.Several correlations that relate the choke size with other variables involvedin the multi-phase flow phenomena have been proposed in the literature. Thevalidity of these correlations for Middle-East oil wells has been assessed inthis study.A new correlation has been developed to describe the choke performance ofthe Middle-East oil wells. The proposed correlation is similar to theOmana-type correlations based on dimensional analysis. This correlation wasexamined against a wide range of well test data collected from various oilfields in Egypt, Kuwait, Libya, and other Middle-East countries. Statisticalanalysis was used to compare to accuracy of the results obtained from the newcorrelation with those from other correlations. The effect of different PVTcorrelations on the predictive accuracy of the fluid flow equations has beenalso investigated. These properties included the surface tension of the gas/oilsystem, gas compressibility factor, solution GOR, and oil volume factor.The developed correlation provided highly accurate results compared to theother existing correlations. This correlation is applicable for critical flowconditions and requires knowledge of the PVT data. This study showed that theuse of different PVT correlations resulted in slight variation in the accuracyof the developed correlation.Further analysis has been conducted in the present study on the Gilbert-typeempirical correlations. Results emphasized the linear relationship between flowrate and upstream pressure for critical flow.IntroductionThe choke is an important element in the well production system. One of themain functions of choke is to control flow. The pressure drop is an importantfactor influencing the pressurization of the formation and as a result theperformance and productivity of the well. A choke malfunctioning may cause thedownstream pressure disturbances to be transmitted upstream leading to damageof surface facilities or death of oil well. Therefore, the prediction of flowbehavior of multi-phase mixtures through chokes is of great industrial interestin the design and development of producing wells. Furthermore, moderntechniques are currently used in the design and optimization analysis over theentire production system. This analysis requires accurate models that candescribe the performance of each component in the system; including thewellhead choke. Several models of multi-phase flow through chokes exist in theliterature. Most of these models were developed for limited ranges ofproduction conditions. The magnitude of production rates of the flowing oilwells in the Middle-East countries is unique. Therefore, more research isneeded to justify the validity of the available models for Middle-East oilwells.Literature ReviewTwo-phase low through chokes may be either critical or subcritical. Most ofthe models presented in the literature were developed for critical flow. Thesemodels comprise the Gilbert-type1 empirical relationship. Thisrelationship was revised by Ros, 2 Baxendell,3 Achong,4 Pilehvari,5 Secen, 6 and Osman andDokla.7 These correlations consist basically of a three-parameterequation in which the flow rate is linearly proportional to the upstreampressure.

AB  - Abstract Injection of Low Sulphate Seawater (LSSW) instead of untreated Full Sulphate Seawater (FSSW) is widely used to mitigate barium sulphate (BaSO4) scaling risk at production wells. LSSW injection may no longer be required when the barium (Ba2+) concentrations in the produced water drop below a certain threshold. Such a trigger value could be estimated from the BaSO4 precipitation tendency. Relaxation of requirements for the Sulphate Reduction Plant (SRP) can significantly reduce operational costs. This study investigates the impact of several parameters on the timing and degree of relaxation of the output sulphate (SO42-) concentration by the SRP. Finally, the optimal switching strategy is proposed for a field case. The strategy for switching from LSSW to FSSW, e.g. time and method (direct or gradual increase in the SO42- concentration) were initially investigated using generic 2D areal and vertical models. The sensitivity study included the impact of reservoir heterogeneity and initial Ba2+ and SO42- ion concentrations. Findings were later applied on a full field reservoir simulation model followed by a mineral scale prediction software to investigate the specific switching strategy for a field that has multiple wells and significantly more complex heterogeneity. Results show that Ba2+ concentrations in the formation brine impact the choice of switching time more than the output SO42- concentration produced by the SRP. The degree of heterogeneity around the producers also has a significant impact on the switching time. Another parameter is the contrast in the permeability between layers; higher contrast allows longer period of co-production of the scaling ions and thus delays the switching time. In the field case, switching to FSSW at early times allows higher consumption of Ba2+ ions due to its in situ precipitation. Ba2+ is no longer a limiting ion, and so a higher degree of deep reservoir precipitation reduces the requirement for prolonged LSSW injection. Another strategy is a gradual relaxation of LSSW output, which allows even earlier build-up of the injected SO42- concentration compared to the direct FSSW switch. The study investigates the reservoir parameters that impact SO42- relaxation of LSSW injection for a field. Following the proposed workflow, the optimal relaxation strategy can be designed for other field cases.

AB  - THE EFFECT OF DISPERSIVE MIXING ON SCALING LABORATORY MICELLAR FLOODS TO RESERVOIR DIMENSIONS Abstract For economic reasons, only a limited slug of a relatively expensive micellar fluid (followed by a polymer-water mobility bank) can be injected to polymer-water mobility bank) can be injected to displace oil with the current micellar flooding process. Once a micellar slug is injected, its process. Once a micellar slug is injected, its composition does not remain the same; instead the composition changes as the slug propagates. Scaling the micellar flooding process can be thought of as using laboratory tests which consider the compositional changes that occur as the slug propagates to determine the minimum size slug necessary for effective displacement of oil throughout the swept portion of the reservoir. portion of the reservoir. Previous work has shown that surfactant retention is an important cause of compositional change which results in loss of displacement efficiency with a micellar slug. Dilution of a micellar slug (due to dispersive mixing) can be an equally important cause of poor displacement efficiency. In scaling a micellar flood, the dispersivity of the reservoir must be estimated from tracer tests. The ability of the micellar fluid to recover oil when it is diluted is a critical design criterion when reservoir dispersivity is large. Laboratory tests in short reservoir cores can be appropriate to simulate performance in a reservoir when the reservoir performance in a reservoir when the reservoir dispersivity is greater than the dispersivity of the reservoir cores. Berea sandstone which has very low dispersivity is not an appropriate porous medium in which to study the scaling of a micellar flood. Introduction Tertiary recovery processes using micellar fluids to mobilize residual oil require that the injected chemicals be propagated at a concentration such that the micellar fluid is either miscible with the oil or increases the capillary number (the ratio of viscous to interfacial forces) to a level suitable for "miscible-like" oil displacement. Even if oil displacement by a micellar fluid is initially miscible, the displacement usually becomes immiscible due to chemical loss and dispersive mixing which reduce the concentration of the chemicals in the micellar slug. If the capillary number during the immiscible displacement is high enough, the displacement will be "miscible-like"; the immiscible phases will flow without mutual interference phases will flow without mutual interference resulting in very efficient oil displacement. Designing a micellar flood can thus be simplified to the following: 1) Formulating, in the laboratory, a micellar fluid which is miscible or has a high capillary number with the reservoir oil. 2) Scaling the laboratory performance to reservoir dimensions. This latter step can be thought of as using laboratory measurements to determine the minimum size slug of micellar fluid which will maintain a chemical composition that remains miscible or "miscible-like" through the swept portion of the reservoir. Only relatively short (usually less than 0.15m) cores of reservoir rock are available for laboratory tests. Therefore, extremely long core tests in reservoir rock are usually not possible, but one must still be able to scale the effect of system length. The objective of this paper is to demonstrate the combined effect on oil recovery of surfactant retention and dilution of the micellar slug (due to dispersive mixing) as a function of system length. Background Compositional simulators have been developed and applied to predict performance of micellar floods in laboratory cores; however, simulators based on simplified concepts are often used in predicting micellar flood performance in a reservoir. predicting micellar flood performance in a reservoir. A stratified reservoir simulator based on streamtube concepts was used by Yanosik et al. to predict performance of the Sloss tertiary micellar pilot. performance of the Sloss tertiary micellar pilot.

AB  - AbstractWhen oil is produced under high water-cut conditions, oil in water emulsions can be formed. The break-up of oil droplets predominantly takes place in the choke valve. We have conducted laboratory experiments to investigate the effect of flow through a choke valve on the oil-droplet-size distribution in the emulsion. In these experiments the choke is modeled as a circular orifice in a pipe. The droplet sizes after break-up can be correlated to the mean energy dissipation rate per unit mass in the orifice. The experiments have been conducted with two set-ups on a different scale. The relation, which we have derived for the maximum stable droplet diameter downstream of the orifice can be applied to both scales. Furthermore the effect of oil viscosity on the droplet sizes after break-up has been investigated.

AB  - Abstract Scaling has been a major concern in a conventional gas condensate well production facility in northwest Louisiana.  Severe barium sulfate deposits have been noted throughout the facility causing operational issues resulting in increased lifting costs.  The production is primarily from two formations, the Cotton Valley and Hosston.  The Hosston has relatively high sulfate while the Cotton Valley has relatively high barium.  Combining these waters creates a barium sulfate scaling environment similar to worst case North Sea or Gulf of Mexico examples. The applications of a bench-top scale deposition monitor as well as a real-time monitor are described.  The use of both techniques is illustrated by presenting results of field testing performed at location to get a better understanding of the severity of the scaling problem as well as the treatment rate of scale inhibitor necessary to control scaling.  The rate of scaling was determined for the Hosston and Cotton Valley waters, independent of each other and also as mixtures of the two, using the bench-top monitoring technique.  The rate of scaling of the combination of the waters was an order of magnitude greater than either of the waters by themselves.  The inhibitor dosage required to inhibit scale was also determined and reported for each water condition.  Real-time monitoring was conducted in the facility at a point just prior to water disposal.  The results obtained to date agreed with the bench-top monitor results.  Inhibitor treatment is currently being adjusted based on real-time monitoring to optimize field treatment and further validate the bench-top method.   Introduction BHP Billiton is currently producing gas and condensate at their Elm Grove Facility located in north-west Louisiana.  Production is spread over a large geographical area of the Haynesville Shale.  There are over 700 producing wells to manage, typically producing gas with small amounts of condensate and/or water.  The production is primarily from three formations, the Cotton Valley, Lower Cotton Valley and Hosston.  The production depth ranges from 6000 to 10,000 feet.  Most wells are either single or dual completion and contain packers.  The Hosston has relatively high sulfate while the Cotton Valley has relatively high barium.  Combining these brines creates a severe barium sulfate scaling environment. The brines can combine downhole in dual completion wells.  Mixing of incompatible brines also occurs during gathering and processing of fluids.  Total fluids from the wells are piped in common lines from wells to water stations where the fluids are separated.  In some cases, the brine is separated at the well and trucked to a disposal well.  Barium sulfate, calcium carbonate and iron sulfide are typical scales which have been troublesome at this location.  However, the most costly problem and severe problem is barium sulfate resulting from mixing of the brines.

AB  - Abstract A relaxed scaling technique, "linear scaling," has been employed in such single-fluid injection processes as waterflooding. This paper develops processes as waterflooding. This paper develops theory and applications of linear scaling for such multiple-fluid injection processes as micellar/ polymer flooding. polymer flooding. Linear scaling demands that saturation profiles and related properties be completely defined by specifying the number of pore volumes of each fluid injected at any time in the injection history. Mobility and saturation profiles can be constructed from over-all pressure measurements and production data, respectively, from linear cores. Detailed micellar flooding experiments, in which saturation profiles, differential pressures, and production histories were measured, demonstrate production histories were measured, demonstrate that these laboratory multiple-fluid injection displacements are linearly scalable to a good approximation. We employed two micellar slugs that were used in field tests of the Maraflood oil recovery process. Introduction Rigorous mathematical scaling of displacement processes and relaxed scaling techniques have processes and relaxed scaling techniques have been discussed extensively. "Linear scaling" specifies direct correspondence among experiments when equal pore volumes of fluids have been injected, and is a special relaxed-scaling situation. It requires geometric similarity and identical rock and fluid properties for both model and prototype, but assumes that most of the dimensionless groups normally employed for scaling are unimportant for describing a displacement process. Calculation of relative permeability as presented by Welge and Johnson et al. are examples of single-fluid linear scaling applications. In multifluid chemical injection schemes, linear scaling will have limited application and must be employed with caution. In particular, fluid dispersion may not be expected to follow a linear law; this would be important in field applications. Nonlinear gravity effects could also be influential in certain geometries. In organizing saturation and pressure data from several micellar flooding experiments, it became apparent that these systems might be linearly scalable. This observation prompted clarification and better definition of linear scaling relationships for multiple-fluid injection processes. This paper is an outgrowth of that work. Its purpose is to develop linear scaling theory for multiple-fluid injection processes and demonstrate that our laboratory micellar floods scale linearly to a good approximation. THEORY Basic Considerations For a given porous medium and fluid system, a displacement process is said to be linearly scalable if fluid concentration (saturation) at any point and time is a function of only the number of pore volumes of each fluid injected with respect to that point. This is a fundamental definition. The key to applying linear scaling is understanding the concept of relative pore volumes injected with respect to a point. In one-dimensional systems (linear, radial, or spherical), this is easy to define and the practical consequences of being able to do so will be expanded later. For experimental models having heterogeneity, anisotropy, and/or non-one-dimensional boundaries (such as five-spot patterns), it is impossible to assign a fixed pore volume to a given point, since streamlines change configuration during nonunit mobility ratio displacements. Even so, by assigning an appropriate pore volume history to each point, the basic definition will still hold. One consequence of the linear scaling definition is that, in geometrically similar rocks of different size but at the same point in their relative injection history (same number of pore volumes of each given fluid injected into each rock), the saturation or concentration profiles (or contours) in all the rocks will be similar different by only a linear magnification or reduction.

AB  - ABSTRACT: Concept selection and initial design of deepwater subsea production systems can have a profound impact on the evaluation of the commercial viability of a discovery. Although detailed design comes later in the process, the decisions made at this early stage of a project will generally provide the template that is carried through to construction and operation. Scale management can be a significant factor in deciding the outcome of the concept selection phase, particularly for fields that are expected to require seawater injection at some stage in their design life. Early in a project it is common to have information from only one or two exploration wells and where water samples are often not available, are heavily contaminated, or have been gathered from locations away from the main production targets. This paper outlines the difficulties faced when evaluating the various scale management techniques available to deepwater operators at the early stages of the project design process and in providing fit for purpose design recommendations that are not overly conservative but that still account for the risk posed by having only limited supporting information available. An approach is presented that addresses these risks and uncertainties by applying scale modeling along with a simple heuristic strategy to support the selection of appropriate scale management techniques for deepwater subsea fields. Several comparative examples for projects in the Gulf of Mexico are provided to explain the different outcomes that can result from this process. INTRODUCTION The management of inorganic scale deposition in deepwater environments is often a challenging and costly problem due to the difficulties associated with the treatment and intervention costs when operating remote subsea wells and production systems. This is particularly true for many fields in deepwater basins such as the Gulf of Mexico, Brazil and West Africa, where reservoir pressures can quickly deplete as a result of primary production and drive the use of water injection from early in the field life. The principal water source available to offshore operators during the early stages of production is seawater. Volumes of produced water for reinjection are typically too low to support pressure maintenance during the early to mid-life of many fields and so this can generally only provide a limited fraction of total injection water requirements. Aquifer water injection is also a possibility in locations where a water source is available from zones that are not connected to the primary production horizons. However, the availability of suitable waters in sufficient volumes and at sufficient pressures to justify drilling subsea wells is a rare occurrence. The high sulfate contents available in seawater often drive scale formation following injection water breakthrough at producing wells in situations where mitigating steps are not otherwise taken. The most common scales seen are barium sulfate and strontium sulfate, both of which can be very difficult to remove once they have formed. The difficulties associated with this are often further increased by a lack of available information during the early stages of new-build projects.

Introduction The San Diego Gas and Electric Co./U.S. DOE Geothermal Loop Experiment Facility (GLEF) located near Niland in the Imperial Valley, CA, has operated on a high-salinity (about 200,000 mg/L) geothermal fluid from the Salton Sea Field since May 1976. The conversion process being tested is a four-stage binary system (Fig. 1). The geothermal fluid is flashed at successively lower pressures in open drum-type separators. Generated steam pressures in open drum-type separators. Generated steam passes through a scrubber and into a tube and shell heat passes through a scrubber and into a tube and shell heat exchanger, where the heat is transferred to a secondary, working fluid. Steam condensate can be cascaded and mixed with the brine in the next stage, collected and combined with the cooled brine and reinjected, or used for cooling water make-up. The working fluid is condensed after expansion across a throttling valve that simulates a turbine. Waste heat is removed with a conventional spray pond, With a turbine generator (to be installed later) this facility will become a 10-Mw power plant. Water was used as the working (binary) fluid plant. Water was used as the working (binary) fluid during start-up and initial operation. Isobutane, which is the expected preferred working fluid for a binary power plant, will replace water. plant, will replace water. The GLEF operated for about 3,000 hours with frequent interruptions for inspection and facility modification. During this period, the facility operated on one production well (either Magmamax 1 or Woolsey 1). production well (either Magmamax 1 or Woolsey 1). Flow rates were 400,000 lb/hr, about one-half the GLEF design capacity. The temperature and pressure of the fluid entering the first stage is 370 deg. F and 165 psia. Exit temperature of the brine is 200 deg. F. All unflashed brine is reinjected in the reservoir. Brine Chemistry The geothermal fluid available from this reservoir is a hypersaline brine containing about 200,000 mg/L total dissolved solids (TDS), mostly chlorides (Table 1). These chlorides remain in solution during the heat extraction process and subsequently are injected back in the reservoir. Certain minor species, however, such as silica, lead, and iron have limited solubility and, as the brine is cooled during the heat extraction process, they precipitate from solution and deposit on pipe and vessel precipitate from solution and deposit on pipe and vessel surfaces. The principal noncondensable specie is carbon dioxide. Small amounts (up to 6 mg/L) of hydrogen sulfide also are found in this geothermal brine. Ammonia is also present in the geothermal brine and has a significant present in the geothermal brine and has a significant effect on brine chemistry. The pH of the brine (5.6 to 5.8) is such that a carbonate type of precipitate normally is not observed in spite of the high carbon dioxide level (up to 0.3 wt %). In this process, the available energy in the geothermal brine is extracted as steam. Drum separators and scrubbers can produce high-quality steam with a TDS content of less than 10 mg/L. However, noncondensable gases (carbon dioxide and hydrogen sulfide) also accompany this steam. Part of the ammonia in the geothermal brine also is driven off with the steam. When these noncondensable gases are removed, the pH of the brine increases to about 6.0. JPT P. 1240

AB  - AbstractThree sets of new scaling criteria for high-pressure steam injection experiments were derived and tested in a unique series of experiments. Unlike previous scaling criteria for steam injection, which require the use of porous media and pressure conditions different from the field, the present criteria permit the use of reservoir rock, fluids, and pressure conditions. Two of the new approaches relax some of the geometric scaling groups in order to satisfy other scaling requirements.To examine the suitability of these three new scaling approaches as well as a widely used approach from the literature. Results from a large model were compared with those of smaller models scaled by the appropriate scaling approach. The scaled models, representing one-eighth of a jive-spot pattern, were designed to simulate steam flooding of a prototype reservoir in Alberta. This series of experiments examined the scaling of the mechanisms for heat transfer and steam zone development by injecting steam into a completely water-saturated reservoir. Very good predictions of energy distribution, temperature distribution, production rate, steam zone volume, produced steam quality, nd steam breakthrough were achieved for two of the scaling approaches. The ability of each approach to scale from one physical size to another is illustrated and the relative merits and potential applications of the approaches are discussed, leading to useful guidelines for the design of steam injection experiments. IntroductionSteamflooding is a proven method of enhanced oil recovery. Many laboratory studies have been conducted in an effort to improve this process. Some of the experiments study the various mechanisms of a process and extend the results to make field predictions by using numerical simulators. Other experiments, referred to as scaled experiments, permit direct interpretationof the results to predict field performance.Scaled model experiments can be used to predict the effect of various parameters On the production response of a reservoir undergoing steam injection. The parameters include injection rate, production pressure, slug size, completion interval, bottom water, reservoir heterogeneities, and steam quality. Scaled models are also used to calibrate numerical models as the relative influence of many of the mechanisms is similar to that expected in the field.It is difficult to satisfy all of the criteria required to design scaled experiments of stearn flooding processes. Consequently, some of the scaling requirements must be relaxed. The choice of which requirements to relax will depend on the particular process being modelled. Scaling of the phenomena considered to be least important to a particular process might be relaxed without significantly affecting the major features of the process. The objectives of this work were to develop and verify suitable scaling techniques for steam injection experiments and identify the conditions under which a particular scaling approach is most suitable to a particular recovery process (e.g. steam additives, thin reservoirs, gas caps, bottom water, etc.).Scaling ApproachesA number of scaling approaches have been used in the past for steam injection experiments. Stegemeier, Volek, and Laumbach(1) developed an approach which operates at sub-atmospheric pressures and uses fluids which are different from those found in the field.

AB  - AbstractDeepwater well control with a subsea BOP is often difficult and in many circumstances impossible with the usual methods and procedures. This is mainly due to the difficulty to maintain the circulating pressure below the low formation fracture pressure, because of high friction losses in kill and choke lines. Such a situation often leads to losing the drilled section. To cope with this situation, a new method was developed and presented in a previous paper. It consists in lightening the mud column inside the choke line by injecting base oil or water at the BOP level. Simulations using a dedicated software demonstrated the possibility to compensate lines friction losses.(essai labo ?) To validate simulations and to confirm the operational feasibility of this method, a field test was conducted on a Deepwater well in Angola. Pressures were recorded at surface, at the BOP level and downhole, and confirmed predicted values. The test was performed without any modification of the drilling rig, and no operational problems were encountered. The test fully confirmed that the method allows the physical removal of friction losses in the choke lines. The obtained downhole pressure during a well control is then lowered compared to a conventional method in all cases where the choke line friction losses cannot be removed artificially at the choke. (such as swak kick in an horizontal section). Test procedure, simulated pressures and field measurements, are detailed in this paper, and complemented by their analysis and resulting operational guide lines.IntroductionThe complexity to control a kick during deepwater drilling is mostly due to very low formation fracturation pressures combined to high friction losses in long control lines. Numerous authors addressed this problem in the past years. J.M. Rezmer-Cooper(1) identified the danger to use a constant Maximum Allowable Annular Surface Pressure (MAASP) during the whole well control procedure because of the inter-actions of the high friction losses and the gas swap-out. J.P James(2) proposed to use the Maximum Allowable BOP Pressure instead of the MAASP. The advantage of this procedure is evident because it bypasses the complexity of pressure variations in control lines. Nevertheless this is only possible when an accurate BOP pressure sensor is available. D. Bertin(3) proposed the Advance Driller's Method that better take into account the complex inter-actions of kick control parameters. Nevertheless all these improvements have still to cope with the core problem: control lines friction losses.As a result of a Deepwater research project, T. Botrel(4) proposed the Additional Flow Rate Method (AFR's method) that could physically nullifyor even invert these friction losses. This method was validated through computer simulations, but had to be confirmed by a field test. Therefore a field test was planned and performed on a Deepwater well in Angola.This paper presents results of this field test as well as the detailed analysis and inherent conclusions.AFR method summaryThe principle of the method (Figure 1) consists in mixing the mud, returning through the choke line, with a light and thin fluid at the BOP level. The light fluid could be for instance the base oil with an Oil Based Mud (OBM) or water with a Water Based Mud (WBM). The resulting mixture has a lower density and a lower viscositythat induces a reduction of the overall pressure drop inside the return control line. The mud flow rate is the Slow Circulating Rate (SCR) and the light fluid flow rate is the Additional Flow Rate (AFR). The total flow rate inside the return control line (choke line) is the sum SCR + AFR. The light fluid is pumped with the cement unit pump through the kill line or through a chemical injection line if available. The light fluid is named "AFR's fluid" and the corresponding flow rate "AFR's flow".

AB  - Abstract   This study shows the utilization of the Artificial Neural Network (ANN) as a practical engineering tool for estimating the flow rate and selecting the optimal choke size. In this study, the existing choke correlations available in the literature were reviewed, evaluated and compared with the newly derived ANN. The new method can be used to predict the required choke size and can also be used to provide a quick and accurate evaluation of the well performance, by considering wellhead conditions and pressure-volume-temperature (PVT) parameters.   Two models were developed based on 4,031 data points: 80% for training, 10% for validation and 10% for testing. The new models were found to outperform all the existing correlations and have provided the lowest error, with an average absolute percent error of 3.7% for the choke size prediction and 6.7% for the flow rate estimation. The new models can estimate with a higher accuracy the optimal choke size and flow rate. Therefore, the new models can help advance reservoir management and production operations in the following ways: producing the reservoir at the optimal rate; preventing water or gas coning; maintaining back pressure; and protecting formation and surface equipment from unusual pressure fluctuation.     Introduction   Accurate correlation for estimating multiphase flow rate is important for quick evaluation of well performance. The behaviors of oil and gas flow through chokes are of two types, critical and subcritical. Critical flow occurs when the velocity is equal or greater than the velocity of sound for this condition to exist, downstream or line pressure must be typically 55% of the tubing or upstream pressure. In critical flow the rate depends on the upstream pressure, gas-oil ratio (GOR), and choke opening only, therefore, the changes in the flow line pressure doesn't impact the flow rate.   Several studies on (liquid gas) two phase flow through chokes were conducted to find the relationship between choke size, flow rate and other wellhead parameters. These theories and correlations describe two phase flow through restrictions and are used to determine the most optimum choke size or to estimate flow rate using wellhead parameters. These empirical correlations were based on a certain range of parameters involved in developing the correlation. To determine the strength and weakness of these correlations, statistical analyses are usually utilized.   In recent years, neural network, which is a parallel distributed information processing model that can recognize highly complex patterns within available data, has gained popularity in petroleum applications. Many authors discussed the applications of neural network in different petroleum engineering subjects, such as pressure-volume-temperature (PVT), reservoir characterization, reservoir simulation and others. Nevertheless, none of the researchers studied the application of neural networks for two phase flow through chokes.   The purpose of this study is to review theories and correlations available in the literature and to develop new Artificial Neural Network (ANN) for two phase flow through chokes, using data from several fields and reservoirs.

Abstract The predictive accuracy of eight critical two-phase flow correlations are tested against field measured production data, from 210 well tests, covering brood ranges of production rates, choke sizes, upstream pressures, gas-liquid ratios, and oil API gravities. Test data are divided into four selected categories based on choke size (D) : D less than 6, 6 less than D less than 10, 10 less than D less than 30, and D >30/64". The correlations included in this study ore those of Gilbert Ros, Baxendell, Achong, Poettmann-Beck, Omana, Ashford and Hazim-Ghassan. The average percent error, absolute average percent error, and standard deviation ore computed for each correlation. Due to inconsistency of results obtained by the included correlations, the multiple regression analysis is used to revise the corrections of Gilbert, Omana, and Hazim-Ghassan for each range of choke size. As a result, twelve new revised correlations are achieved. The results obtained by the new revised correlations have shown that : 1- None of the new correlations yielded satisfactory results for data with D >30/64". 2- For the other data, the revised forms of Omana correlation proved to be an accurate models for predicting choke performance. Several arrangements of the independent variables are tested in the regression analysis to find out a correlation that best fit the measured data with D >30/64". As a result new empirical correlation is developed. Based on the statistical results, the new correlation clearly outperformed the remaining correlations in this data category.

AB  - SummaryKnowing the mass flow rate is important in relation to production control in the oil and gas industry. If the change in pressure and temperature across a choke can be correlated with the mass flow rate, the actuator position, and the properties of the well stream, this may constitute a mass flow rate meter that is both simple and inexpensive compared to other designs. However, knowledge of the predictive ability and accuracy of available mass flow rate models is required to qualify such a solution. Predictions from several mass flow rate models are compared with data from a crude oil/natural gas/water system at pressures varying from 8 to 16 bara. The fluids used were recombined oil from the Njord field in the North Sea, natural gas from the Kaarstoe terminal in Norway, and water with added salts to give typical produced-water properties. Two different choke geometries (orifice and cage type) were tested for three different opening areas. The experimental results are compared with eight mass flow rate models for multiphase flow through chokes. These are the two Hydro models originally developed by Selmer-Olsen, the Sachdeva et al. model, the Perkins' model, and four two-phase multiplier models - the Morris, the Chisholm, the Simpson, and the homogeneous equilibrium model (HEM), respectively. For the orifice-type geometry, the Hydro short model predicted the results most accurately. For the cage-type geometry, the Hydro long model, which includes losses in the choke geometry, predicted the results most accurately. A modification to the slip model improves the results of the Hydro models, predicting all the 367 test points with a standard deviation of 7.8%. The average error of absolute values was 5.8%.IntroductionThe flow of multiphase flow systems is important in the process industry in relation to both the control of process conditions and to safety in relation to the overpressure control by relief valves. In the oil and gas industry, the flow characteristics of the choke control the production of oil/gas/water coming from the wells. For reservoirs with advanced well systems, including more than one flow branch tied back to a common manifold, it is essential to control the individual well streams by individual chokes. Managing this production control becomes even more critical when producing from horizontal wells and thin oil zones.In recent years, tools for well allocation and control have been developed with the intention of determining the mass flow rate from a minimum of data about the multiphase conditions in the upstream tubing, the fluid properties, and the choke characteristics. Such choke characteristics range through both subcritical and critical flow conditions. These tools use both traditional flow models from the literature as well as new models developed specifically for choke control in the hydrocarbon production industry.The objective of the present work was to develop a unique data set for validation of such flow models and to use it in a benchmarking exercise to evaluate the suitability of some typical models in use. The present paper focuses on the subcritical part of the data set obtained under controlled laboratory conditions with hydrocarbons from North Sea oil fields.The main difference between hydrocarbon well streams and single-component systems are that well fluids include a large number of components, from light to heavy hydrocarbons. The kinetics caused by flashing of the light components through a choke are expected to be different than single-component systems. Furthermore, reservoir fluids often include a separate water phase in addition to the gas and oil phases.Depending on the upstream geometry and flow rates, several different flow patterns exist that will influence the choke conditions (such as liquid slugs, phase inversion phenomena, etc.). Moreover, the choke geometry influences choke flow patterns.LiteratureThe literature survey focused on fairly simple models that provide a relationship between the multiphase mass flow rate, dotted m, the choke pressure drop, ?p, the model parameters, data for upstream and downstream pressure and temperature, upstream composition of the well stream (oil, water, and gas), and the choke setting (opening). Model imperfections or simplifications would typically be corrected by introducing a calibration factor.Choke manufacturers have ways of sizing and selecting wellhead chokes normally based on a flow coefficient CV often determined in a test bench with water flow.1 The flow coefficient for valve sizing, CV, has, by definition, the dimension of the flow rate of water in gal/min for a pressure drop of 1 psi.2 Using SI units for the right side, we obtain the following expression for CV.

AB  - The Haynesville Shale is one of the largest unconventional gas fields in the US. It is also one of the deepest, with wells reaching more than 10,000 feet below ground. This uncommon depth and overpressure leads to initial reservoir pressures of up to 12,000 psi. These pressures are uniquely high among shale gas reservoirs, and require special treatment. We show that the methods developed by Patzek, et al. can scale all individual wells' gas productions to fit upon a single, universal curve. Haynesville wells can take months or years for flowing tubing pressure to stabilize, so we modified the type curves to take this into account. Furthermore, we introduce a PVT solver in order to calculate gas properties at up to reservoir pressures. When we apply the scaling theory to 1,410 individaul well productions in the Haynesville, we find 313 wells which have entered exponential decline due to pressure interference. We perform full scale reservoir simulations to determine the time to interference for wells with geologic parameters typical of the Haynesville, and fit these to the wells where we have observed pressure interference. From this, we arrive at time to interference for the remainder of Haynesville wells, and use this to arrive at production forecasts for all individual wells.

AB  - Abstract The study estimates initial effective fracture pore-volume (Vfi) and fracture volume loss (dVef) for 20 wells completed in the Montney and Eagle Ford Formations. Also, it evaluates the relationship between dVef and choke-size strategy. We conduct this study through the following 3 key steps. First, we apply rate-decline analysis on water flowback data from these Montney and Eagle Ford wells to estimate the ultimate water recovery volume, approximated as Vfi; Second, we estimate dVef using a fracture compressibility relationship to evaluate the fracture volume loss of Eagle Ford wells; Third, we investigate the effect of choke size on dVef for the Eagle Ford wells with fastback and slowback strategies. Semi-log plots of flowback water rate versus cumulative water volume for the Montney and Eagle Ford wells show straight-line trends which represent harmonic decline. The estimated Vfi accounts for about 84% and 26% of the total injected water volume in the Montney and Eagleford wells, respectively. The results show that about 10% of the fracture volume can be lost during flowback. This loss in fracture volume mainly happens during early flowback period and becomes minimal during late flowback period. Comparative analysis shows a relatively higher dVef for fastback wells compared with that for slowback well, indicating that slowback may slow down the loss in fracture volume. This paper proposes a method to estimate initial fracture volume and investigate the loss in fracture volume during flowback processes. Field data analyses lead to an improved understanding of the factors controlling water flowback and effective fracture volume. Introduction The analysis of flowback rate and pressure data is used to characterize fracture networks in unconventional reservoirs. As such, several flowback models have been proposed and applied on early flowback data to estimate effective fracture pore-volume (Vef) for shale and tight gas/oil wells (Abbasi et al. 2012, 2014; Xu et al. 2015, 2016, 2017; Ezulike et al. 2016; Fu et al. 2017). However, input parameters such as fracture compressibility are generally unknown or hard to measure. This can lead to high uncertainty in estimates of output parameters like Vef.

AB  - Abstract Slugging in pipeline-riser systems is becoming more common as the petroleum industry matures. Current trends of developing deepwater fields and producing from marginal fields via subsea tie-backs to existing facilities often lead to slugging. Slugging also occurs in fields approaching end of life, due to decreased gas coupled with increased water productions. Slugging is a major problem for offshore operations because it causes large fluctuations in gas and liquid production which may cause platform trips and riser vibrations. These will lead to production deferment, riser integrity/safety issue, and potential abandonment for fields operating near end of life. The most recent slug control technology in Shell is the Smart Choke. This technology utilizes a single control valve which is installed between the riser top and first stage separator. It is an active slug control device which regulates liquid and gas flow by manipulating the control valve opening. Compared to conventional slug management techniques which require large footprints and high capital/operating costs, Smart Choke is compact and cost-efficient.  Smart Chokes have been installed in the Gulf of Mexico, Nigeria and Malaysia. The pipelines had large fluctuations in pressure and gas/liquid flowrates due to hydraulically unstable flowline/riser system. The installed Smart Chokes were tested to be effective in suppressing riser-induced slugs and controlling slugs initiated within horizontal pipelines. Deployments to-date has shown for example field life extensions of over one year or production gains of about 5 to 10%. This paper presents the implementation of Smart Choke from feasibility study to site implementation in a Malaysian field. It is the first project that integrates Smart Choke control into a platform control system for easier operation. Field data are presented to demonstrate how Smart Choke has extended the field life through the control of slugs. As a result, the shut-in field which was planned for abandonment could continue production. Introduction Pipelines are used in offshore production to transport hydrocarbon fluids in multiphase flow i.e. gas, condensate/oil and water from satellite wells to topside facilities for processing. When producing hydrocarbons in multiphase flow, the outlet of the pipeline may encounter irregular production of the different fluid phases. This irregularity may occur due to changes in operating conditions as the fluid flows through the pipeline, geometrical layout and/or fluid compositions. Major process upsets may occur if the fluctuations in gas and/or liquid production at the end of the pipeline cannot be accommodated by the receiving processing facilities. Large fluctuations in gas/liquid production i.e. slugging, will lead to difficulty in controlling the liquid level at the first stage separator and increase the risk of liquid carryover into the downstream gas processing train. Production may have to be constrained to prevent the gas/liquid fluctuations from exceeding topsides facilities limit.  Severe cases of slugging may also cause platform trips and shutdowns due to high liquid level or high gas pressure, riser vibrations or impact the mechanical integrity of vessel internals. These will lead to production deferment, riser and mechanical integrity/safety concern and potential abandonment for oil/gas fields operating near end of life.

AB  - Summary Different choke-management strategies have been adopted by operators in the field; however, no general method exists for systematically selecting an optimum choke-management strategy. In this study, we propose a general method for the selection of bean-up duration and bean-up strategy (choke management) that will maximize well productivity by minimizing formation damage, reducing sand production, and reducing the impact of multiphase-flow effects. Strategies of stepwise bottomhole-pressure (BHP) adjustments are compared by use of the principle of superposition and the analytical solution of the transient radial-diffusion equation for vertical wells operating under different choke settings. The optimum choke-management strategy is based on the anticipated formation-damage mechanisms. For example, if fines migration and sand production are a concern, then minimizing the wellbore pressure gradients is the primary criterion for the selection of the optimum choke-management strategy. Using the analytical solution and simulation results, we conclude that for relatively short bean-up durations (i.e., infinite-acting behavior), the pressure-gradient reduction at the wellbore varies logarithmically with increasing bean-up duration. Choke-management strategies appear to have similar performance as far as no more than 70% of the drawdown is applied during the initial 20% of the overall bean-up duration. For longer durations (i.e., when the presence of the no-flow boundary is felt), the optimum strategy depends on both reservoir properties and radial extent. For the case of square drainage area, a plot suggesting the optimum strategy with respect to dimensionless duration is presented. Positive skin and multiphase flow near the wellbore negatively affect the performance of bean-up strategies. For vertical wells producing from multiple layers, bean-up strategies should be selected with respect to the effective horizontal permeability, ultimately yielding the greatest pressure-gradient reduction in the low-permeability zones. The proposed method enables engineers to select the optimum choke-management strategy with respect to bean-up duration and formation properties. The duration of the bean-up process is drawdown dependent, thus further research is encouraged in determining the maximum allowable pressure gradient to curtail sand production.

AB  - AbstractThe recirculation method using a bottom hole choke to prevent intermittent production and prolong pump life in prevent intermittent production and prolong pump life in wells lifted with the Electric Submergible Pumps (ESPs) is a new technique that was developed in ARCO offshore North West Java Sea Contract Area. In some of the new fields developed by ARCO, accurate well productivity data was not available at the time that ESP sizing operations were conducted. This limitation resulted in some wells having ESPs that were oversized incomparison to the well's inflow liquid capacity. This situation is undesirable in that the well intermits and causes the pump to operate outside its designed operating range. Pumps which operate out of the recommended range for a prolonged period of time will have a short run life in comparison to one that is properly sized. In order to circumvent the problem either one of the following three options is available to the engineer. 1. Allow the oversized pump to run until failure (if possible) at which point the ESP is extracted from the well. 2. Use the variable speed drive by reducing the frequency to get lower production rate. 3. Install a down hole choke to allow recirculation of well-bore fluids so the ESP well does not pump off. (i.e. the well does not intermit). The last option has been pioneered in the ONWJ Contract Area and has saved a considerable amount of expense since the installation of a dowhhole choke only requires a slick line unit which is more cost effective than a work over or snubbing rig as option (1) above would require. Additionally, the use of the downhole choke has increased the average pump run life considerably field wide. IntroductionThe Electrical Submergible Pump (ESP) has been utilized in ARCO Indonesia Offshore North West Java sea contract area since 1976, started in the Arimbi area. In 1984 this utilization expanded to PAPA, BIMA and finally reached the North West corner area. Currently, there are more than one hundred producing wells using ESP. Inspite of the proper selection of the ESP as a means of artificial lift in some wells, we are still facing a few problems. One of them is running an oversized pump in problems. One of them is running an oversized pump in comparison to the well rate potential. P. 713

AB  - AbstractDespite several decades of study, there is no rigorous method for scaling flow through heterogeneous permeable media. Existing methods neglect heterogeneity and spatial correlation, which we now know to be of fundamental importance in many processes. On the basis of statistical techniques and inspectional analysis, we present a general method to scale flow through heterogeneous permeable media for an immiscible displacement of oil by water in a two-dimensional, anisotropic, heterogeneous cross section with statistically stationary properties.Our results illustrate the interplay among local heterogeneity (the variance at a lower cutoff in a power-law variogram), global heterogeneity (the variance at an upper cutoff) and zonal heterogeneity (the power-law upper cutoff and exponent). The effects of the scaling groups obtained from the method have been examined in detail, and some important flow characteristics, which were unknown or poorly understood before, have been revealed.IntroductionScaling is the translating of results from one system to another. The first system is usually small in scale and the second of a much larger size. The classical approach to scaling is to formulate the results of all responses of geometrically similar systems in terms of dimensionless variables and (scaling) groups. All systems with the same dimensionless groups will have the same dimensionless response. The dimensionless groups also can point to various limiting cases where one factor is clearly dominant over another and, consequently, simpler descriptions can be employed. Our previous work demonstrated an exhaustive procedure, using inspectional analysis (IA), to determine the scaling groups of immiscible displacements through homogeneous permeable media. We extend this to heterogeneous media here.The always-present heterogeneity of a permeable medium is a major roadblock that hinders the study of scaling. During the last three decades, many researchers have attempted to find ways to scale flow through heterogeneous permeable media. Carpenter et al. published the first paper in this field that extended the Rapport scaling relationships from homogeneous media to heterogeneous media of communicating strata of different permeability. Van Daalon and Van Domselear later extended this work to a medium with either a continuously or a discontinuously varying permeability distribution. The basic difficulty with these works is the simplified representation of reservoir heterogeneity.More complicated representations have appeared in works that do not deal with scaling. Spivak and Giordano et al. included random heterogeneity generated by using a normally distributed permeability field without spatial correlation. Moissis et al., Araktingi et al., and Waggoner et al. used geostatistical techniques to generate permeability fields based on the coefficient of permeability variation, or the Dykstra-Parson coefficient, and autocorrelation. Sorbie et al. extended Waggoner et al.'s work to define flow regimes and their significance for small autocorrelation. They also demonstrated that the importance of a "shape" scaling group.None of these have indicated a scaling method for flow through heterogeneous permeable media. Therefore, the major objective of this work is to illustrate an exhaustive method to provide such scaling. Another objective of the work is to examine effects of the scaling groups obtained, and to reveal some important flow characteristics that were previously unknown or poorly understood.General conceptsA. Heterogeneity and scalePermeable media are heterogeneous if they display spatial variability of their properties. Reservoir heterogeneity has long been recognized as an important factor in determining reservoir performance and describing heterogeneity is a crucial step toward to understanding it.

AB  - Abstract The predictive accuracy of ten critical two-phase flow correlations in combination with four PVT property correlations, is tested against field measured production data, from 210 well tests, covering a broad range of production rates, choke sizes, upstream pressures, gas-liquid ratios and oil API gravities. Test data are divided into four selected categories based on choke size (D) : D <6, 6 ≤D <10, 10 ≤D <30, and D ≥30/64 ". The average per cent error, absolute average per cent error and standard deviation are computed for each correlation combination. It is observed that the choice of empirical PVT correlation appears to have only a minor effect on final calculated statistical results. Also it is found that most of the compared correlations yielded unsatisfactory results, therefore an attempt is made to find correlations that best fit the measured data. As a result, four new correlations are developed (a correlation for each diameter category). Based on the statistical results, the new correlations clearly outperformed the original correlations. Introduction Several correlations have been published for describing critical two-phase flow through wellhead chokes. Most of these correlations were based on limited ranges of flow variables. Their validity is limited by the quality and scope of the data upon which they are based. The objectives of this study are: to determine the optimal combination of critical flow and PVT correlations for predicting flow rates; and to modify the existing correlations if necessary or develop new correlations that best fit the measured data. The correlations compared are those of Gilbert(1), Ros(2), Baxendall(3), Achong(4), Poettmann-Beck(5), Omana(6), Ashford(7), Pilehvari(8), Sachdeva et al.(9) and Hazim-Ghassan(10). Some of the correlations require values of fluid physical properties, combinations of the following PVT correlations are used to estimate them: Oil FVF Standing(11) Vazquez-Beggs(12) Ghassan-Naeema(13) Solution GOR Standing(11) Lasater(14) Vazquez-Beggs(12) In addition, other PVT properties are calculated using the following correlations: Gas Compressibility : Hall-Yarborough(15) Gas-Oil Surface Tension : Baker-Swerdloff(16) The performance of each critical flow/PVT correlations was checked against the measured well data. Statistical tools were used to determine the optimum correlation combination for predicting flow rates. Well Test Data Fifty-six tests from Iraq wells, 108 from Poettmann's study(5), 27 from Ashford's study and 37 from Omana's study are combined in a data bank for this investigation. The approach developed by Sachdeva et al.(9) (Eq. 1) is used to verify that the test data collected are within the critical flow regime rather than subcritical flow regime.

AB  - Injection of Low Sulphate Seawater (LSSW) instead of untreated Full Sulphate Seawater (FSSW) is widely used to mitigate barium sulphate (BaSO4) scaling risk at production wells. LSSW injection may no longer be required when the barium (Ba2+) concentrations in the produced water drop below a certain threshold. Such a trigger value could be estimated from the BaSO4 precipitation tendency. Relaxation of requirements for the Sulphate Reduction Plant (SRP) can significantly reduce operational costs. This study investigates the impact of several parameters on the timing and degree of relaxation of the output sulphate (SO42-) concentration by the SRP. Finally, the optimal switching strategy is proposed for a field case. The strategy for switching from LSSW to FSSW, e.g. time and method (direct or gradual increase in the SO42- concentration) were initially investigated using generic 2D areal and vertical models. The sensitivity study included the impact of reservoir heterogeneity and initial Ba2+ and SO42- ion concentrations. Findings were later applied on a full field reservoir simulation model followed by a mineral scale prediction software to investigate the specific switching strategy for a field that has multiple wells and significantly more complex heterogeneity. Results show that Ba2+ concentrations in the formation brine impact the choice of switching time more than the output SO42- concentration produced by the SRP. The degree of heterogeneity around the producers also has a significant impact on the switching time. Another parameter is the contrast in the permeability between layers; higher contrast allows longer period of co-production of the scaling ions and thus delays the switching time. In the field case, switching to FSSW at early times allows higher consumption of Ba2+ ions due to its in situ precipitation. Ba2+ is no longer a limiting ion, and so a higher degree of deep reservoir precipitation reduces the requirement for prolonged LSSW injection. Another strategy is a gradual relaxation of LSSW output, which allows even earlier build-up of the injected SO42- concentration compared to the direct FSSW switch. The study investigates the reservoir parameters that impact SO42- relaxation of LSSW injection for a field. Following the proposed workflow, the optimal relaxation strategy can be designed for other field cases.

AB  - Abstract The surface choke has been utilized in the oil industry to control withdrawal rates per well and to optimize production especially after water breakthrough. However, as found out from this study, applying undue restrictions in horizontal wellbores intersecting high permeability features can have an adverse impact on well performance and unnecessarily lock oil potential. This paper investigates the effect of surface choke on water cut and flow contribution along horizontal wellbores that encountered natural fractures and high permeability streaks (Super-Ks). The study considered different down-hole completions; open-hole and cased-hole. The investigation was carried out using Multi Phase Flow Meter (MPFM) measurements at different choke sizes in addition to production logs (FSI), wellbore simulation modeling, and real-time data. Instant data monitoring was instrumental in insuring stabilization of sub-surface static pressure while performing many rate tests at different choke sizes. Moreover, it flagged the role of rate stabilization on water cut behavior and rate data quality. The presence of conductive fractures and Super-Ks substantially influences the flow profile and water cut of horizontal wellbores. These features create high permeability conduits along wellbores such that they dominate production and may cause some matrix sections to contribute little or nothing as observed on FSI profiles. The effect of fractures on production from less permeable sections in the wellbore was investigated at different operating rates using horizontal wellbore simulation modeling. Both MPFM measurements and FSI logs showed that water cut from horizontal wells, affected by fractures and/or Super-Ks, can decrease if they're flowed at higher rates. Upon reviewing and analyzing data from numerous FSI logs, the study has been able to relate the water cut and surface choking to the well productivity index (PI). Consistently, wells with PI more than twice the averaged matrix PI were found to always perform better at bigger choke sizes. By choke relaxation, the water cut decreased by up to 22% while increasing oil production. Wellbore modeling also suggested that the influence of a fracture on flow contribution from remaining sections in the wellbore can be minimized if the well is operated at higher rates. Restrictive surface chokes were found to disproportionately affect lower permeability sections compared to conductive fractures or Super-Ks which in most cases were invaded by water after water breakthrough. Relaxing these surface chokes allowed more contribution of dry oil from the lower permeability sections, hence the increase in overall oil production and drop in water cut in the affected wells.

AB  - Summary Barite (BaSO4) is one of the common scales in oil-and-gas production. Extensive work has been conducted to study barite nucleation and inhibition at temperatures below 100°C. However, with the advance in deepwater exploration and production (E&P), which can encounter high-temperature (HT) conditions, a better understanding of barite-scaling risk at HT (e.g., >150°C) becomes essential. In this paper, a systematic study was conducted to explore barite nucleation kinetics from 70 to 200°C in synthetic brines containing phosphonate (–10 ppm) or polymeric (5–10 ppm) scale inhibitors. A 2-hour protection time with or without any detectable barite nucleation was used to define the scaling risk. To detect barite nucleation, two novel apparatuses were developed--a modified dynamic flow loop and a batch reactor. The modified dynamic flow loop has a retention time of up to 4 hours and is ideal to carry out experiments at higher than 100°C. Ba concentrations in the effluents were monitored to determine barite nucleation more precisely compared with traditional "tube blocking" technique. The new batch reactor uses our newly developed laser-detection method, a transparent pressure tube, and an oil bath. The transparent pressure tube allows laser light to pass through and can withstand 150-psi pressure at 175°C, therefore providing an efficient approach to study the precipitation kinetics of scales and to evaluate inhibition efficiency of inhibitors at HT. Constant inhibitor-concentration isopleths of diethylenetriamine pentamethylene phosphonic acid (DTPMP) for barite inhibition were constructed on the basis of our experimental data. Finally, a semiempirical model that is based on data of barite nucleation and inhibition kinetics from this study and previous work was built to predict scaling risk of barite at different physicochemical conditions. This model covers a wide range of temperature (from 4 to 200°C) and brine compositions. It also covers the effect of Ba2+–SO42– ratio in solution, common cations (e.g., Ca2+), and thermodynamic hydrate inhibitors on barite precipitation. Model precipitations were found to be consistent with field observations. The results of this study can guide the design of barite-scale treatment for HT oil-and-gas production.

AB  - Abstract Automatic and remote operated drilling chokes have been in the petroleum industry for a very long time. Managed Pressure Drilling (MPD) operations have been using these chokes since ±2006 and prior to that Underbalanced Drilling (UBD) operation have been using them for decades. The main control or actuation of these drilling chokes is achieved by adapting standard API-16C hydraulic or electric actuated worm gear drive actuators. These methods of actuation however have limitations related to ‘Response Time’ and ‘Equipment Failure', making these actuators less desirable for MPD applications. An advanced method of actuation using ‘Electro Servo Actuator’ is presented as an alternative to alleviate these challenges. These electro servo actuators are designed from the outset considering the requirements of MPD Choke operations, and are optimized to provide precise control of chokes along with a reduction in the number of potential failure points. During extensive laboratory testing, required as a quality standard for our MPD choke's factory acceptance program, these actuators provided very accurate and responsive pressure control to quick changes in pressure demands based on variations in both set point and flow. Furthermore, the initial field testing of the actuator in the MPD field operations demonstrated the same precise and accurate pressure control tracking, along with better performance at ‘lower flowrates’ when compared to worm gear driven chokes. Full-scale field application on over 20 different projects across North America, including a wide range of severe weather conditions, exceeded the expectations and results from initial testing. In conclusion, the use of this new ‘Electro Servo Actuator’ technology greatly increases the precise control of drilling chokes very crucial for all MPD applications. This technology reduces the potential failure points in the actuators. It enhances the uptime of the actuator and its life cycle, thereby minimizing the need for routine maintenance. Its smaller size and design enables development of more compact MPD chokes and equipment.

AB  - AbstractLength frequency distributions of fractures are shown to have a power-law trend across many orders of magnitude. This allows an estimate to be made of the full number of fractures and faults existing in a reservoir over that which can be measured from core and seismic data. This relationship has been applied to reservoir studies involving the continuity of juxtaposed sands, permeability impairment, and estimating the number of fractures that a horizontal well may intersect. Many more fractures and faults exist in reservoirs than those that can he observed from seismic and core data, which have significant implications for reservoir characterisation, geomechanical properties and waterflood behaviour. IntroductionThere is a tendency for natural fractures in reservoirs to gain the attention of development teams only when the fractures provide permeability significantly greater than that of the matrix: usually in reservoirs which would not be commercially productive without the presence of those fractures. These reservoirs are deemed as `naturally fractured' and are, of course, an important resource in the hydrocarbon industry. However, the somewhat loose application of this term tends to lead to the neglect of natural fractures as a component in the description of a much larger set of reservoirs. By the term `fractures' we encompass both joints (extension fractures) and faults (all fractures whose walls have undergone shear displacements). The wider importance of natural fractures includes the following: 1. Juxtaposition of different lithologies across faults can cause either an interruption in reservoir continuity, or enhancement due to the juxtaposition (across non-sealing faults) of depositionally isolated units. 2. Fractures provide surfaces with an intrinsic conductivity that is almost certainly different from that of the surrounding matrix, occurring either through genesis (e.g. the cataclastic grain comminution in a granulation seam), diagenesis (i.e. mineralisation) or aperture governed by present-day effective stress. These altered surfaces can form a first-order perturbation to the permeability variations arising from depositional processes. In addition, the intrinsic conductivity of a fracture can change as stresses change in the reservoir rock during the development life of a field. There is growing evidence of the dominant influence of fractures in the lateral anisotropy of waterfloods, a process in which the reduction in stresses due to injection probably plays a significant role. The geomechanical behaviour of natural fractures during depletion may manifest itself as an influence upon compaction drive, subsidence and even casing failures. The presence of natural fractures carries particular implications when development of a reservoir with horizontal or high-angle wells is considered. The most obvious change is that high-angle wells have a greater probability than conventional wells of intersecting sub-vertical or vertical fractures. This fact has led to spectacular successes in the exploitation of reservoirs containing conductive natural fractures, for example in the Austin chalk of Texas. Additionally, the influence of natural fractures on the viability of horizontal or high-angle wells may be effective in at least two other ways: a. The productivity benefit of a high-angle well is very dependent upon the effective ratio of vertical to horizontal permeability. Fractures can increase or decrease this ratio. b. Conductive natural fractures and faults may provide pathways for extraneous water production from an underlying aquifer or gas production from a gas cap. In all these applications a knowledge of the true frequency distribution of fractures is a necessary component in a complete synthesis of the process. However, direct measurement of the distribution is hindered because reservoir fractures are observable only in the relatively limited ranges in scale of seismic and core data. We examine in this paper the concept that scaling relationships in fracture distributions enable the quantitative interpolation between the ranges of observable fracture sizes. We are concerned here primarily with spatial frequency distributions of fractures. A knowledge of the true form of these is a first step towards being able to predict the effect of fractures on fluid flow, but the subsequent steps of connectivity and conductivity are beyond the scope of this paper. REVIEW OF FRACTURE DISTRIBUTIONS The literature dealing with fractures in rock covers many disciplines and industries. Many assessments of frequency distributions of fracture lengths and spacings have been reported. The distributions have usually been given as one of log normal, negative exponential, gamma, Weibull, or occasionally power law or Pareto. P. 367

AB  - Abstract This paper presents the results of model studies made to demonstrate the validity of applying the "basic" waterflooding scaling relationships of Rapoport to water-wet reservoirs composed of communicating strata of different permeability. Results demonstrate that these relationships can be validly applied, and also show the combined effect of variables on recovery. This demonstration was needed to confirm that the sizable effects of communicating strata on waterflood behavior, observed in model studies, were actually representative of field behavior. Introduction Rapoport, Collins and others have presented scaling laws for modeling water-oil displacements. The validity of these laws has been experimentally demonstrated for homogeneous systems only. Recently, however, several investigators have presented the results of multilayer model studies made to determine the effects of viscous, capillary and gravitational forces on oil recovery in systems composed of communicating layers of different permeability. Dyes and Braun, using miscible displacements to simulate water flooding, showed that vertical communication adversely affects recovery at unfavorable viscosity ratios in the absence of capillarity. Ogandzhanyants and Egorova, Gaucher and Lindley, and Richardson and Perkins modeled water-oil displacements in layered systems using immiscible fluids with capillary forces present. These investigators found more efficient behavior than in the miscible system of Dyes and Braun. However, since the scaling laws had not been verified for heterogeneous systems prior to or during these tests, it was necessary to assume that the results were representative of field behavior. This report presents the results of model studies made at Jersey Production Research Co. to find out if the waterflooding scaling relationships are valid when applied to water-oil displacements in heterogeneous reservoirs with vertical communication. Data obtained in the study show the combined effects of viscous, capillary and gravitational forces on oil-recovery behavior. The studies were performed in strongly water-wet systems where strong imbibition forces were present. For systems of different wettability, the effects of capillary imbibition would be somewhat different than those presented. APPROACH The scaling laws studied were those developed by Rapoport and designated by him as "basic" scaling laws. These relationships require that the model be scaled to the geometry of the prototype, and that the model and prototype be operated at the same viscosity ratio and have identical relative permeability curves, contact angles and boundary conditions. It is also necessary that the groups , and be identical in the two systems, although any of the parameters making up the groups may be different. Finally, the capillary pressure of one system must be directly proportional to that of the second. Studies were conducted in two four-layer models, representing quadrants of five-spots, which were geometrically similar and which had the same glass-bead packing. The fluids used assured the same wettability in both models. Thus, the contact angles and relative permeabilities of comparative sand layers in the two models were identical and the capillary pressures were directly proportional. However, one model had a characteristic length three times that of the other. To make the scaling groups equal and to check the scaling laws, it was necessary to adjust the rate, water-viscosity level, interfacial tension and water-oil density difference to compensate for the difference in model sizes.

AB  - AbstractState-of-the-art completion technologies to more efficiently support the needs of the oilfield continue to be developed. For example, intelligent completion techniques, which are designed to allow the operator to reconfigure well architecture without well intervention, have gained a great deal of attention because of their capabilities to improve monitoring and overall well performance in multi-zone oil and gas field developments. In all of these multi-zone intelligent-well completions, flow adjusting and monitoring devices or interval control valves are located between zonal isolation packers to control flow into or out of each zone.The first generation of these interval control valves was a choke that offered only four positions. To overcome the position limitations, an infinitely variable choke has now been designed. The requirements for this next-generation interval control valve provided many design challenges. This paper describes the design, development and testing of a metal-tometal sealing, infinitely variable downhole choke with true position sensing capability. All topics from the conceptual design and customer requirements to accelerated erosion testing and component life predictions will be discussed. Testing has verified that the new interval control valve can support the needs of the multi-zone well completion.IntroductionThe development of a surface controlled reservoir analysis and management system (SCRAMS?intelligent completion system) that would provide intelligent well capabilities began in 1994. The completion system was based on use of a permanently installed electrical network to transmit data and control a number of downhole well tools. Among the first downhole tools that were developed for use with the new system was the four-position interval control valve (ICV). With a limit of only four positions, the four-position ICV allowed for only full open, closed, and two intermediate choke positions. In addition to the limited choice of positions, the size of the flow ports for the intermediate choke positions had to be selected far enough in advance to allow time for manufacturing of the equipment.1Almost immediately, it was obvious that the four-position ICV's would not be adequate to fulfill the promise of the greatly enhanced well control that the new intelligent well concepts were capable of providing. As a solution, the idea for an infinitely variable interval control valve (IVICV) was conceived. The IVICV was a joint project between two service companies that based the choke requirements on intelligent well as well as operator needs. The valve that was subsequently developed was capable of addressing the need for a downhole fully adjustable choke that could be operated with a SCRAMS controlled sensor actuator module (SAM?unit). Each zone of a multizone well can now have an individual sensor actuator module and an IVICV for adjustable flow control with pressure and temperature feedback to the surface. Fig. 1 is a schematic drawing of the IVICV.Basic Operational Concept of SCRAMS Intelligent Completion System and the IVICV

AB  - AbstractThe nature of flow in porous media is determined by the interaction of the physical properties of the medium and fluids, and by the interplay of various forces involved in the displacement process. Identifying flow regions at a given reservoir operating condition is a key issue in forecasting reservoir performance and hence of optimizing operations. This work identifies dominant flow regions at various conditions. Three dimensionless groups, NgvM/(1+M) (gravity/viscous ratio), NcvM/(1+M) (capillary/viscous ratio) and Rl2 (shape factor), are defined and used to resolve flow regions. The analysis shows that the relative magnitudes of forces involved in the system combined with the reservoir properties determine the flow region and fluid distribution in the medium.By choosing appropriate ranges for the dimensionless numbers, recovery processes can be specified from the general theory, and the boundaries to flow regions confirmed by comparison with existing experimental and simulation results. Three commonly studied flow systems have been investigated, which are miscible displacements without dispersion (Ncv˜0) in layered reservoirs, immiscible displacements (Ngv˜0) in layered and homogeneous media, and flow in highly fractured reservoirs.1 IntroductionIn this paper, we examine the scaling laws and flow regions controlling various types of flow behavior in systems with simple forms of heterogeneity. If we imagine displacement of oil by water in a two-dimensional, vertical cross-section of two layers with differing permeability, the distribution of oil and water at any time during the displacement will be controlled by a combination of physical phenomena. Water will usually flow faster in the high permeability layer. If the water is, less viscous than the oil, then viscous fingering may influence the flow pattern. Gravity segregation will induce vertical flow. Capillary forces will also cause transverse flow or crossflow, as water imbibes from the high permeability layer into adjacent low permeability zones (in a water-wet porous-medium). The relative importance of each flow mechanism depends on the flow rate, the density difference between oil and water, the mobility ratio, permeabilities and capillary pressure curves for the layers, and so on. At low flow rate, for example, capillary and gravity forces will dominate the flow pattern, but at high flow rate, viscous forces will control fluid distributions.We consider scaling of viscous, gravity, and capillary forces for displacements in homogeneous porous media and in systems that contain some simple heterogeneity such as layers and fractures. We do so by making the material balance equation dimensionless, thereby deriving a set of dimensionless groups that describe the relative magnitudes of the various forces. While many investigators [6, 7, 8,10, 18] have used the same approach for subsets of the flow problems examined here, there has not previously been a comprehensive analysis which attempts to include a wide range of experimental data covering the combined effects of viscous, gravity, and capillary forces. We have analyzed many sources of experimental and simulation data to identify limiting flow regimes and to establish the range of values of the dimensionless groups over which transitions from one region to another occur. We find that the experimental information confirms consistent boundaries for the flow domains, and thus our results give a comprehensive mapping of the overall flow behavior.

AB  - AbstractThe main purpose of this paper is to show the importance of chokes in thesimulation of surface facilities and reservoirs as integrated systems. In orderto predict producing rates accurately, it is necessary not only to model thefluid flow in the reservoir but also to couple the gathering system to thereservoir. The interaction between these two parts can have a great influencein the performance of the whole system and this interaction is greatly affectedby the use of chokes in surface facilities. Existing choke models are evaluatedand the effect of placing chokes in the surface model is studied and someresults are presented. Techniques for simultaneous simulation of reservoir,well and surface facilities will be presented in a future paper.IntroductionThe main reason for having a choke in the system is to control flow rateand, consequently, produce at the most efficient rate, prevent gas and waterconning, avoid formation damage, prevent excessive sand production and protectequipment from pressure fluctuations.The choke is a very important unit of production facilities because asignificant part of the total pressure drop can occur in the choke. A choke candecouple the reservoir or a particular reservoir domain from the productionfacilities, thus changing the characteristics of the entire system.Because surface chokes have the function of controlling rates, many authorshave stated that they should be sized to operate under critical flow. Criticalflow occurs when the velocity of the fluid reaches the sonic velocity. At thispoint, variations in the downstream side of the choke cannot be felt upstreamand, therefore, as shown in Fig. 1, there is no rate variation, even if thedownstream pressure decreases. This rate is called the critical rate and it isfunction only of the upstream parameters.

AB  - AbstractScaling the experimental data of spontaneous imbibition without serious limitations has been difficult. To this end, a general approach was developed to scale the experimental data of spontaneous imbibition for most systems (gas-liquid-rock and oil-water-rock systems) in both cocurrent and countercurrent cases. We defined a dimensionless time with almost all the parameters considered. These include porosity, permeability, size, shape, boundary conditions, wetting and nonwetting phase relative permeabilities, interfacial tension, wettability, and gravity. The definition of the dimensionless time was not empirical, instead, was based on theoretical analysis of the fluid flow mechanisms that govern spontaneous imbibition. The general scaling method was confirmed against the experimental data from spontaneous water imbibition conducted at different interfacial tensions in oil-saturated rocks with different sizes and permeabilities. A general analytical solution to the relationship between recovery and imbibition time for linear spontaneous imbibition was derived. The analytical solution predicts a linear correlation between the imbibition rate and the reciprocal of the recovery by spontaneous imbibition in most fluid-fluid-rock systems.IntroductionAn important fluid flow phenomenon during water injection or aquifer invasion into reservoirs is spontaneous water imbibition. Scaling the experimental data of spontaneous water imbibition in different fluid-fluid-rock systems is of essential importance to designing the water injection projects and predicting the reservoir production performances. Ignoring the effects of relative permeability, capillary pressure, and gravity in the dimensionless time might be the reason that the existing scaling methods do not always function successfully. It is known that these parameters influence the spontaneous imbibition in porous media significantly. For that reason, these parameters should be honored properly in the scaling.Many papers have been published to characterize and scale spontaneous water imbibition in both oil-water-rock systems1-20 and gas-liquid-rock systems21-24. However few have included the effects of capillary pressure, relative permeability (both wetting and nonwetting phases), wettability, and gravity simultaneously. This is important because all the parameters may play an important role in many cases and may not be ignored. For example, a lot of enhanced/improved oil recovery processes relate to low interfacial tension (IFT). In these cases, capillary pressure as a driving force may be small and gravity may not be neglected. In some cases, gravity may also be a driving force as pointed out by Schechter et al.25.One of the frequently-used dimensionless time groups in the past to scale spontaneous imbibition data is defined as follows (Ma et al.15):Equation 1where tD is the dimensionless time, k is the rock permeability, f is the porosity, s is the interfacial tension between the wetting and nonwetting phases, t is the imbibition time, µm is the geometric mean of the viscosities of the two phases and La the characteristic length.The dimensionless time defined in Eq. 1 is suitable for oil-water-rock systems under specific conditions. These include: (1) wettability must be the same, (2) relative permeability functions must be identical, (3) capillary pressure functions must be identically proportional to interfacial tension, (4) initial fluid distributions must be duplicated, and (5) gravity must be neglected. On the other hand, Eq. 1 implies that higher IFT systems have higher imbibition rate, which is not true in many cases. For example, Schechter et al.25 observed experimentally that the imbibition rate in oil-water-rock systems with low IFT was greater than with high IFT in high permeability core samples. Al-Lawati and Saley18 reported a similar phenomenon.

AB  - Abstract The scaling has been found to be a major problem in thermal production, such as in the Steam-Assisted Gravity Drainage (SAGD) operation. In addition to providing a favorite environment for corrosion, scaling could result in extreme plugging in sand control devices. Therefore, any coatings for the equipment and completion in thermal production should provide significant anti-scaling surface properties. This paper presents a detailed study, including field and laboratory testing, on application of the Electroless Nickel Coating (EN-coating) in thermal production environment. Initially, EN-coated and uncoated carbon steel samples were tested in laboratory to assess the scale, hardness and adhesion of inorganic and organic materials. Successful laboratory testing lead to a field testing plan, which involves deploying the EN-coated and uncoated samples into a horizontal well for thermal production. The specimens were recovered after certain time and a comprehensive X-ray Photoelectron Spectroscopy (XPS) and Energy-Dispersive Spectroscopy (EDS) were performed to assess accumulation of fouling substances on EN-coated and uncoated carbon steel. This study suggests the application of the EN-coating technology to solve the problems caused by scale, and adhesion of organic and inorganic material in thermal production. The comprehensive laboratory testing and field data from the SAGD wells shows that EN-coating significantly improves the well integrity in the harsh thermal production environment.

AB  - Summary A large database on critical and subcritical flow through orifice- and cage-type chokes have been obtained in the Multiphase Flow Loop (MPFL) of Norsk Hydro Oil and Gas R&D Center in Porsgrunn, Norway. This work is an extension of the studies performed in 1999 (367 data points) by Schüller et al. (2003), making a total data set of 509 data points. The downstream separator pressure and temperature were kept at 8 bara and 50°C, respectively. The maximum upstream pressures were approximately 40 bara, giving a maximum pressure ratio of approximately 4.  The Hydro models (Schüller et al. 2003) show a very good agreement for prediction of mass flow rate, both for critical and subcritical flow conditions, with an average error of absolute values of 6.2% and a standard deviation of 8.9%. Comparisons with the models of Sachdeva et al. (1986) and Perkins (1993) show that the performances of these models are not as good as the Hydro model. The Sachdeva model and the Perkins model both have average errors greater than 22%, with standard deviations greater than 25%. The Hydro models also seem to predict reasonably correctly the transition between subcritical and critical flow conditions. Introduction Oil and gas production from well clusters—where several wells flow into one subsea flow line—often requires flow control for each well. Knowing the actual performance of the manifold chokes is of vital importance for optimal production. In recent years, interactive multiphase-flow models and control systems for well allocation have been developed. As input, they use measured data about the wellstream in the upstream tubing and combine this with data about the choke valve opening and its flow characteristics. The Troll oil field and several other fields in the North Sea have been successfully developed with such automatic choke-control systems on the basis of special choke models, which are valid for both critical and subcritical flow conditions. These systems were based on the first versions (Selmer-Olsen 1991; Selmer-Olsen et al. 1995) of the Hydro models. Subcritical flow through chokes is often described by means of choke characteristics in terms of a flow-capacity factor (CV )parameter. The characteristics often are determined in laboratory tests using single-phase water. To determine critical flow conditions, several approaches are used: Homogeneous equilibrium flow models assuming thermodynamic equilibrium. Homogeneous nonequilibrium flow models assuming no flashing of gas affecting the flow rate through the choke ("frozen?? flow) (Henry and Fauske 1971). Models assuming empirical or semiempirical relations describing the kinetics of flashing of gas from the liquid (Henry and Fauske 1971). The main difference between multiphase flow of real reservoir fluids through a production choke and the single-component systems in laboratory tests can be listed as follows: ? Reservoir hydrocarbon fluids include a large number of components from light to heavy hydrocarbons.  The kinetics caused by flashing of the light components through a choke are expected to be different compared to single-component systems. ? Depending on the upstream geometry and flow rates, there exist several different flow patterns upstream of the choke that may influence the choking conditions, such as liquid slugs, phase-inversion phenomena, etc. (Selmer-Olsen 1991; Selmer-Olsen and Lemonnier 1995).

AB  - Abstract The BaSO4 scaling is a chronicle disaster in waterflood projects with incompatible injected and formation waters. This is usually due to precipitation of barium sulphate from the mixture of both waters and consequent permeability reduction resulting in well productivity decrease. The sulphate scaling damage system contains two governing parameters: the kinetics coefficient characterising the velocity of chemical reaction and the formation damage coefficient reflecting permeability decrease due to salt precipitation. Previous work has derived analytical-model-based method for determination of kinetics coefficient from laboratory coreflood on quasi steady state commingled flow of injected and formation waters. The current study extends the method and derives formulae for calculation of formation damage coefficient from pressure drop measurements during coreflood. The proposed method can be extended for axi-symmetric flow around the well allowing calculation of both sulphate scaling damage coefficients from field data on barium concentration in produced water and well productivity decline. We treat several laboratory test data and field data, and obtain values of two sulphate scaling damage parameters. The values of kinetics and formation damage coefficients as obtained from either laboratory or field data vary in the same range intervals. It validates the proposed mathematical model for sulphate scaling damage and the analytical-model-based method "from lab to wells??. Introduction The formation damage in scaled-up production wells caused by incompatibility of injected and formation waters have long been known. Precipitation of salts results in permeability decline. Among the most onerous of all scaling species is that of sulphates, particularly barium and strontium sulphates[1-3]. Decision making on scale prevention and removal is based on prediction of scaling formation damage provided by mathematical modelling. The mathematical models for sulphate scaling during waterflood consist of mass balance equations for all species with the reaction rate sink terms[8-10,15]. Chemical reaction rate must obey law of acting masses[9,17,19] or another more complex kinetics law[18-20,23-25]. Several numerical[4,5] and analytical[6-8,14] models describing sulphate scaling in laboratory and field conditions are available in the literature. Nevertheless, the problem of model coefficients determination from either laboratory or field data in order to use in sulphate scaling simulation is far from the final solution. It introduces significant uncertainty in scaling damage prediction.  The design and results of barium sulphate quasi steady state scaling tests have been presented in the literature[11-13]. The analytical model for quasi-steady state commingled flow of injected and formation waters in core allows solving the inverse problems of scaling model parameters determination from the laboratory test data[14]. The chemical reaction rate depends on reaction rate coefficient. The reaction rate coefficient can be determined from effluent barium concentration using the analytical solution[14]. Treatment of laboratory data shows that the reaction rate is proportional to flow velocity, as it should be for reactive flows in porous media[17]. The proportionality coefficient is called the kinetics coefficient. The kinetics coefficient depends on rock and fluid properties. It cannot be predicted theoretically for real reservoirs and fluids. Therefore, it must be determined from either laboratory of field data by solution of inverse problems. The second important parameter determining permeability impairment during sulphate scaling is the formation damage coefficient showing how permeability decreases with solid deposition.

AB  - AbstractHorizontal wells are gaining increased prominence in primary recovery and steam injection, yet experimental and theoretical modelling of horizontal wells is still inadequate. This paper explores these two areas. Equations were developed for three-phase and non-isothermal flow in the vicinity of a horizontal well, as well as flow inside the well. These were used to obtain scaling criteria for designing laboratory experiments. The question of skin factor due to perforated casing is also considered. An interesting idea offered is the use of variable diameter horizontal wells. A series of steam injection experiments was carried out in a model, with a concentric well. Temperature distributions were determined and used to interpret oil recoveries and pressure behaviour. Oil recovery performance for different experiments was evaluated to determine the effectiveness of different types of horizontal wells, and the impact of perforated casing. IntroductionIt has been reported extensively(1,2) that horizontal wells offer prospects of improved performance over conventional vertical wells, primarily due to the larger contact area between the formation and the horizontal well. This is especially true for thin oil formations where the reservoir contact area for a horizontal well can be hundreds of times that for a fully-penetrating vertical well, Furthermore, horizontal wells, when strategically placed, can reduce water/gas coning and result in improved cumulative recovery in view of the small draw downs(3). Horizontal wells are also believed to have a much better chance than vertical wells of intersecting systems of vertical and horizontal fractures in an oil-bearing formation, and thus lead to higher production rates(4). In steam injection recovery of heavy oils and oil sands horizontal wells especially when combined with steam-assisted gravity drainage could lead to high production rates, more uniform distribution of steam front leading to improved sweep efficiency and cumulative oil recovery(5,6). One aspect that has so far received little attention in discussions of horizontal well performance concerns the flow in the vicinity of, and inside a horizontal well. Often, it has been assumed that a horizontal well has infinite conductivity and that the flow in the well is predominantly laminar - meaning the pressure drop across [he well is not significant. Dikken(7) showed that this assumption is not necessarily true for most practical situations, and that pressure drops across horizontal wells can significantly affect the performance. This paper attempts to contribute to an understanding of this aspect of horizontal wells by presenting mathematical models of flow in the vicinity of, and inside a horizontal wellbore. These models were used to obtain scaling criteria for a series of scaled model steam injection experiments. Data, including well pressure drop and fluid production rates in the presence of a perforated casing are also reported. Literature ReviewButler, McNab, and Lo(5) presented the first theoretical and experimental study of steam-assisted gravity drainage and horizontal wells to recover bitumen from oil sands. Equations were derived to calculate oil drainage rate and lateral position of steam-oil interface as functions of time and height. A subsequent study by Butler and co-workers(H) introduced improvements to the original model.

AB  - In the case of conventional (displacement) hulls, model testing is based on the assumption (with or without certain refinements) that the total resistance can be expressed as:RT=RF+RR(1)where Rt is measured in the towing tank, and the frictional resistance, Rf, can be accurately estimated by the application of a friction line and the use of the calm-water wetted surface. It is assumed that the dimensionless residuary resistance RR is the same for the model and the prototype vessel. Our article may be considered to be an extension of the classic article by Wilson, Wells, and Heber (1978) to the more complex case of the surface-effect ship, as follows. Specifically, we opine that:RT=RF+RW+RH+RS+RM+RSPRAY(2)Here, Rw is the wave resistance of the vessel (caused by a combination of the actions of the cushion pressure and the two sidehulls), RH is the transom (hydrostatic) drag, Rs is the seal drag, Rm is the momentum drag, and RspRay is the spray drag. Rt is the only one of these quantities that is measured during the model test. The other components require the use of a variety of estimates. In the article, we present specific examples of our approach as applied to a number of tests on surface-effect ship models that we have studied in recent years.

AB  - Abstract Seven barrels of oilfield brine are produced for every barrel-equivalent of energy obtained in the United States each year. With enhanced recovery of hydrocarbons this ratio can be as high as thirty or fifty to one. Scale deposited within production systems associated with high volumes of produced brine can pose serious problems to the operator. Controlling scale pose serious problems to the operator. Controlling scale affects the economics of the field and a scale problem left untreated can result in the total loss of production or costly replacement of facilities. Predicting potential scaling problems can be difficult and Predicting potential scaling problems can be difficult and numerous saturation indexes have been developed to assist in this regard. Some of these will be compared and contrasted along with the advantages and disadvantages of mainframe computer codes. Methods to inhibit scale formation can be varied and are vastly different with respect to economic impact and result. These possible methods including acidization, sequestration, dilution, pressure and temperature control, induced precipitation and inhibitor treatment by treat string and squeeze into the formation will be discused. Finally, the history of scale control in co-production gas wells will be presented. The discussion will focus on inhibitor treat string design and effectiveness and the planning and results of an inhibitor squeeze project. INTRODUCTION TO BRINES AND SCALE Seven barrels of oilfield brine are produced for every barrel -equivalent of energy obtained in the United States each year. With enhanced recovery of hydrocarbons this ratio can be as high as thirty or fifty to one. In addition, refineries process about 24 barrels of water for each barrel of crude oil. Production of natural gas from wells which also produce Production of natural gas from wells which also produce a significant volume (is greater than 1000 BPD) of brine represents a large energy resource. The potential reservoirs in most cases along the Gulf Coast area are calcite-cemented sandstones. Analyses of the produced brines have shown wide variations in composition with total dissolved solids (TDS) ranging from 20,000 to 200,000 mg/1. The major solids in these brines are (in approximately decreasing order): chloride, Cl-: sodium, Na+; calcium, Ca2+; magnesium, Mg2+; potassium, K+: bicarbonate, HCO3-; sulfate, SO42-; bromide, Br-; and iodide, I- . The most common trace elements are (without regard to order, because trace elements show a wide variation in their relative concentrations): arsenic, as AsO43-; cadmium, Cd2+; chromium, Cr3+, copper, CU2+; mercury, Hg2+; nickel, Ni2+; lead, Pb2+: sliver, Ag+; and zinc, Zn2+. Based upon the authors' experience, the following trace elements should be added to these lists: silicate, H4SiO4; iron, Fe2+; barium, Ba2+; strontium, Sr2+; manganese, Mn2+; hydrogen sulfide, H2S; boron, as H3BO3; and carboxylic acids (acetic, propionic, and butyric acid). The brines are strictly anoxic, generally with downhole pH values of from 4.0 to 5.5. Most waters associated with hydrocarbon production could be called "sodium chloride brines with a large quantity of calcium bicarbonate." The components of the gas phase can be highly variable, but normally contain CO2. P. 551

AB  - SummaryGeneral characterization of physical systems uses two aspects of data analysis methods: decomposition of empirical data to determine system parameters and reconstruction of the system attributes using these characteristic parameters. Spectral methods, involving a frequency-based representation of data, usually assume stationarity. These methods, therefore, extract only average information and, hence, are not suitable for analyzing data with isolated or deterministic discontinuities, such as faults or fractures in reservoir rocks or image edges in computer vision.Wavelet transforms provide a multiresolution framework for data representation. They are a family of basis functions that separate a function or a signal into distinct frequency packets that are localized in the time domain. Thus, wavelets are well suited for analyzing nonstationary data. In other words, a function or a discrete data set when transformed into a time-scale space using wavelets shows how it behaves at different scales of measurement. Because wavelets have compact support, it is easy to apply this transform to large data sets with minimal computations.We apply wavelet transforms to one-dimensional and two-dimensional permeability data to determine the locations of layer boundaries and other discontinuities. By binning in the time-frequency plane with wavelet packets, permeability structures of arbitrary size are analyzed. Wavelets are also applied to scaling up spatially correlated heterogeneous permeability fields.IntroductionWhenever there is a need for processing large volumes of data one seeks to represent them in terms of their statistics or spectral content to reduce both the volume and redundancy of data. Examples of this application are abundant. In telecommunication, efficient and economic data transmission is accomplished by representing images by their spectral content. In geophysics, identification of important features in seismic wave forms requires an efficient noise reduction by separating data into different frequency bands. Reservoir characterization in petroleum engineering and hydrology often uses spectral contents of the spatial distribution of reservoir properties, such as porosity and permeability, given by semivariograms to represent the spatial structure of data.Reservoir characterization, which is the main focus of this paper, seeks to define a configuration of reservoir properties such that it has desired properties. Usually, random realizations from a predefined probability density function, obtained from experimental observations, form the elements of all configurations. The solution procedure involves two steps. The first step involves data analysis for parameter estimation, such as statistics and spectral content of data. Often, characteristics of spatial structures present in data are also determined in this step. The second step generates data (realizations) using the parameters determined in the first step. This step also involves a scale change, such as scaling up for data reduction and scaling down for enhancement. Conventional data analysis methods, such as spectral and geostatistical methods, assume that reservoir properties are stationary at all scales of measurement. In other words, these methods assume that the statistical parameters and spatial structures of data are independent of coordinate locations and scale of measurement. For example, while determining the autocovariance function or the semivariogram of a data set, one usually preprocesses the data to remove any known trend. One of the reasons for the requirement of stationarity is that in traditional spectral methods the data are transformed from the time or space domain to the frequency domain by summing up contributions toward a spectral component from every interval of the data. Hence (in the frequency domain), the information of any local structure (present in a specific interval) in the data is not preserved locally. In the example of a semivariogram calculation, the semivariance at a specific lag is the average of the contributions from each interval of the entire data set. Such an averaging method does not have the ability to distinguish between anomalies present in different intervals. Additionally, the stationarity assumption also means that the statistical moments of a data set are independent of coordinate locations. In contrast, in petroleum engineering and hydrology it is common to find isolated or location-dependent discontinuities, such as faults, fractures, and changes in geologic facies in reservoir rocks, and high-permeability streaks. Hence, such a generalized treatment of data that generates semivariograms is inadequate. Semivariograms also do not preserve the multipoint statistics of the data.The second step is often accompanied by a change in scale for data reduction. The objective of this step is to reduce statistical redundancy while preserving important structural features of the data, such as discontinuities or local continuity of extreme values.Conventional data analysis methods have several weaknesses. They generally tend to homogenize information present in data. As a result, information present locally, such as faults, fractures, and shale barriers are lost or diluted. Methods that are capable of preserving such information (nonparametric methods and tensor methods) are considerably more complicated and time consuming than traditional methods.This paper addresses the problems of data analysis and scale change mentioned above by introducing a new approach that is amenable to analysis and scaling of nonstationary data. It is called the wavelet analysis method. Wavelet transforms (WT), a recent development in mathematics,1 provide an alternative method to decompose a signal or data set in time-scale space. A large number of contributions have been made since its inception, especially in computer vision, speech analysis, seismic data analysis, etc.This paper begins with a brief description of the WT. A systematic procedure is then presented for analyzing nonstationary reservoir properties. Several examples involving field data are also presented to demonstrate the application of the wavelet analysis method. The application is first described for one-dimensional data and then extended to two dimensions. Throughout this paper we deliberately refrain from the details of relevant mathematical theorems. Daubechies1 and Chui2 give elaborate proofs of the mathematical formalities involved in wavelet analysis methods.

Abstract A theoretical technique for the two phase flow of oil and gas through wellhead chokes has been developed. This technique non-critical and critical flow condition through a knife edge orifice where the mass flow rate through the choke reaches a definite maximum as the downstream pressure is further reduced. The paper also investigates the pressure differential ranges where critical velocity or the maximum flow pressure differential ranges where critical velocity or the maximum flow rate is attained. The technique is verified by actual measured field data obtained in oil field operation. The purpose of this paper is to demonstrate the technique since it is believed that it will be of use to engineers in the field of oil and gas production in which measuring techniques are so difficult and expensive to carry out. It will be shown in the paper that the method is easy to apply and that it is reliable.

AB  - Abstract Co-existence of gas, water and glycol is commonly in produced fluids of high-pressure gas wells due to formation water production and hydrate inhibitor injection. The interaction between the polar water and glycol molecules can affect the phase behavior and subsequent temperature change during gas flowing through chokes at wellheads. This paper presents an isenthalpic flash method based on the cubic-plus-association equation of state (CPA EOS) to calculate the temperature at the downstream of the choke. In comparison with the traditional isenthalpic flash algorithm, this new method accounts for the self- and cross-association between polar water and glycol molecules, yielding more accurate enthalpy calculation results for fluid containing water and glycol as well as choke temperatures. The proposed model is validated with field test data. Results demonstrate that the average absolute deviations between the measured and calculated temperatures at downstream of chokes based on the proposed method are less than 1.6°C even for vapor-liquid-aqueous three-phase mixtures at pressures up to 100 MPa. Results yield from the proposed method are more accurate than those calculated from the SRK EOS combining with the Peneloux volume shift method and the Huron-Vidal mixing rule.

AB  - In Subsea production systems (SPS), choke valves can be considered to be the heart of the system and are typically set up to control the hydrocarbon production flow and injection of gas and water during both steady-state production and transient flow scenarios. The control functionality of subsea choke valves comprises several aspects: balance of the subsea manifold pressure (when fed from multiple wells with different reservoir pressures), reduction of the flowline pressures (and cost), mitigation for reservoir collapse during startup, adjustment of the flowrates to extend production life and support the functionality of the subsea gate valves to avoid high-pressure drops during startup and shutdown. Safe and reliable operation as well as the controllability performance of the subsea choke valve depend on the effectiveness of the sizing and selection process as well as on the positioning of the choke in the SPS when designing the SPS. The optimum location of the choke valve in the SPS and the arrangement of the piping system upstream and downstream of the choke, including any intrusive probes, are crucial and can impact the operation of the choke valve itself and affect the SPS integrity. The optimized location must consider the production profiles and operation philosophy of the wells, as well as the associated flow assurance issues. Sand particle production and erosion risks, flow induced vibration, hydrates and other deposit hazards are major flow assurance challenges that can affect the choke valve performance and in turn these effects can be amplified by the choke valve and impact the SPS integrity. This mutuality should be considered when designing the SPS and positioning the choke valve in it. This paper summarizes GE Oil & Gas experience in sizing and selection of the subsea choke and its placement in the SPS. The focus is on the integration of a subsea choke valve in the SPS to achieve safe and reliable operation and extend the life of the valve and SPS. In general, the paper provides an overview of flow assurance aspects related to sand production and erosion that should be considered when designing the SPS and optimal positioning of the choke valve. It describes methods to examine erosion issues associated with the subsea choke valve by the means of Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) simulations. Numerical experiments were performed on various choke and SPS arrangements to explore these issues and provide best practices. The results show that details of the fluid composition and operating conditions strongly affect the fluid/particle flow patterns in and around the choke and trim, suggesting the necessity for erosion analysis to ensure safe and reliable operation and emphasize the benefit from using CFD tools for system optimization.

AB  - Despite the significant progress made for the expansion of oil and gas productions from conventional to unconventional sources in the last several years, the steady growth of the hydrocarbon demand is driving the oil and gas industries to explore new or under-explored areas that are often challenging. Because of technological difficulties associated with extremely high temperature (>150°C), pressure (>10,000 psia), and TDS (>300,000 mg/L) at deep water production environments, prediction and control of mineral scaling pose significant challenges. Appropriate experimental data is needed for better understanding of scaling risk in those harsh environments, but current literature lacks the experimental findings that correlate the importance of pressure and temperature on the mineral scaling kinetics. This study attempts to bridge this knowledge gap by formulating the pressure dependence of barite formation kinetics at various temperatures (T) and saturation indices (SI). In order to study the effect of the pressure on the mineral scale formation kinetics, a high temperature high pressure (HTHP) flow loop apparatus was developed and experiments were carried out at various temperatures (70-175°C) and at a range of pressures (15-15,000 psia). Barite scale formation (precipitation) kinetics as a function of the pressure was investigated while maintaining constant pH, T, ionic strength, and SI. To determine the onset of scale formation (i.e. induction time), time dependent composition of reaction mixture containing Ba2+ and SO42- species was analyzed using ICP-OES. In a separate but independent study, barite induction time at various ionic strengths at constant T, P, and SI was determined by laser light scattering method. This work will show that barite precipitation kinetic is a strong function of applied pressure at constant T, SI and TDS. Based on experimental results, the relationship between induction time for barite formation as a function of T, P and SI was established.

AB  - ABSTRACT:This works addresses the problem of how to scale catenary riser model tests, properly considering dynamic similarity. A review on the most important dynamic characteristics and parameters is presented and a relevant group of representative nondimensional numbers is analyzed. Not only FPU induced global dynamics is taken into account as well as VIV and other important phenomena of localized nature, such as those that are typical of the touch-down zone. The general rationale is based on analytical and asymptotic dynamic solutions, previously constructed by means of standard perturbation techniques and asymptotic methods. Such a rationale gave rise to a new concept for small scale riser model design and construction. A riser model made of a silicone tube filled with stainless steel microspheres showed to best fit the intended dynamic similarity, focusing on experiments in two distinct laboratories: a wave ocean basin and a towing tank.INTRODUCTIONOffshore production risers are very slender structures, conveying oil and gas from the well head to the floating processing unity. Such structures are excited at the top, through motions imposed by the floating system and all along the span length, by hydrodynamic loads. The mechanical problem is inherently nonlinear. The main sources of nonlinearities are of two types: (i) geometrical and (ii) associated to hydrodynamic forces due to the action of ocean currents; see, e.g, Pesce and Martins, 2005. The geometrical nonlinearities are related to two main aspects: (a) time varying boundary conditions, of contact type, along the touchdown zone on the sea bottom; (b) large displacements in the static equilibrium configuration. Due to the very large slenderness of the structure, in a common free-hanging configuration, bending stiffness effects are usually restricted to small regions close to the extremities, where high curvature variations are expected to occur, causing large cycling stresses.

AB  - Abstract An offshore gas field located in the Far East has two reservoirs: reservoir A and reservoir B. Production fluids consist of gas and hydrocarbon condensate with some produced water from the two reservoirs. The producing fields are in water depths varying between 250 and 275m with ambient seawater temperatures and operating conditions that result in only occasional concerns about potential hydrate formation in the production systems. Lean Monoethylene Gylcol (MEG) is injected near the wellheads for hydrate inhibition. This paper presents the risk of mineral scaling at critical points throughout the process with the three production scenarios: reservoir A alone, reservoir A and reservoir B, and finally reservoir B alone. Special attention has been put on the effect of mixing produced waters from reservoir A and reservoir B topside. Furthermore there are considerable uncertainties with respect to the amount of organic acids that may be produced; therefore some evaluations have been performed with and without organic acids. Introduction The Far East gas/condensate field consists of two reservoirs: A and B. It is a High Pressure High Temperature (HTHP) field with a Flowing Tubing Head Pressure (FTHP) from 27500 kPa to end of plateau pressure of 4800 kPa. The maximum FTHP temperature varies between 135°C (A reservoir) and 155°C (B reservoir). Reservoirs A and B are sour gases containing respectively 8 and 15% of CO2. The early phase of production will be from reservoir A and will be boosted by reservoir B when reservoir A begins to decline (expected at Year 12.5). The fluids will be processed on a Central Processing Facility, where primary gas/liquid separation will take place. The liquids will then be sent via subsea transfer lines to a Floating Production, Storage and Offloading facility (FPSO) where further processing and MEG regeneration will be carried out. The design of the MEG Regeneration Plant covers two phases of this project represented by cases 1 and 2 as described below. Case 3 covers the sensitivity case and due to uncertainties is not covered in the design but rather commented on with respect to the design. • Case 1 is for the produced water from reservoir A and represents the first 9.5 years of production. • Case 2 represents the maximum produced water rates and will be a combination of the produced water from reservoirs A and B and covers the years 9.5 to 16. After 12.5 years, the production of reservoir B will start up and the highest Rich MEG rates are reached with peak water production in Year 16. • Case 3 (the sensitivity case) represents the highest formation water rate and covers years 16 to 22.5. The largest production of salts will be later in field life, when the production of reservoir A declines whereas the production of reservoir B will increase. An ever increasing number of gas condensate fields are being operated with MEG as the hydrate inhibitor1,2. MEG injection will manage and prevent hydrate formation at the offshore facilities and the pipelines. Two MEG Regeneration Packages will be designed for this project (Figure 1).

AB  - Reconciling data from different scales is a longstanding problem in reservoir characterization. Data from core plugs, well logs of different types, and seismic data must all be accounted for in the construction of a geostatistical reservoir model. It is inappropriate to ignore the scale difference when constructing a geostatistical model. Geostatistical scaling laws were devised in the 1960s and 1970s primarily in the mining industry where the concern was mineral grades in selective mining unit blocks of different sizes. These principles can be extended to address problems of core, log and seismic data. The adoption of these classic volume-variance or scaling relationships presents some challenges. Three specific concerns are the ill-defined volume of measurement, uncertainty in the small-scale variogram structure, and non-linear averaging of many responses including acoustic properties and permeability. We demonstrate the application of volume-variance relations for upscaling and downscaling techniques to integrate data of different scales. Practical concerns are addressed with data from a chalk carbonate reservoir and a clastic reservoir in the Danish North Sea.

AB  - Summary The objective of this study is to develop and validate a theoretical slip model for two-phase flow through chokes. As opposed to the models (Sachdeva et al. 1986; Perkins 1993) used currently by the industry, the present model accounts for slippage between the liquid and gas phases as they pass through the choke. The theoretical basis of the model is a 1D balance equation of mass, momentum, and energy with the assumptions of constant quality and incompressible liquid phase. The present slip model is capable of predicting the critical-subcritical-flow boundary and the critical and subcritical mass-flow rates. A model-validation study demonstrated the capability of the slip models to predict the critical-flow boundary with an average error and standard deviation of 5.2% and 15.5%, respectively. Furthermore, in a laboratory validation, the present slip model predicted the mass-flow rate with an average error of 2.7% and 12.5% standard deviation. Compared with field data, the present slip model predicted the mass-flow rate with 1.4% average percent error and 15% standard deviation. Compared to existing no-slip models (Sachdeva et al. 1986; Perkins 1993) used commonly by the industry, the present slip-model predictions outperformed their predictions in the average percent error in both laboratory and field validation and in the standard deviation in the laboratory validation only. This validation result indicates the importance of the slippage phenomenon.

AB  - Abstract The objective of this study is to develop an upscaling methodology for simulation of tracer injection in naturally fractured reservoirs. 2-D fine grid models that explicitly incorporate fractures are used to represent the realistic fracture distribution from geostatistical characterization. The objective is to determine equivalent properties of the fractured systems, which, as included in conventional double porosity models, will result in a behavior similar to the fine-grid response. The upscaling methodology is based on flow simulation with constant pressure and constant flux boundary conditions. The upscaling parameters of each equivalent double-porosity grid are determined by matching results of the fine grid simulation. The effects of some important factors such as coarse grid size, injection rate, and well location are examined to show the robustness and accuracy of the upscaling methodology. IntroductionGeological characterization of fractured reservoirs has progressed considerably in recent years, allowing for realistic representation of fracture networks. Despite advances in reservoir simulation and computer hardware, such detailed geostatistical results cannot be used directly in the simulation of fractured reservoirs. Up-scaling techniques are needed to translate the geostatistical data into reservoir simulation parameters. There are several upscaling techniques (1-4) used in the simulation of single-porosity reservoirs to reproduce the details of small-scale fluid mechanics and reservoir heterogeneity in coarse-grid models. However, there is no general procedure that is widely accepted for upscaling. The upscaling methods for naturally fractured reservoirs are further behind. Based on the type of fracture system, the upscaling study of naturally fractured reservoirs can be divided into two categories: the single continuum, and the dual continuum approach. For the single continuum approach (5-7) , the fractured system is considered as a heterogeneous matrix system with discrete fractures. Various methodologies, such as the boundary element and finite volume methods, are widely used to deal with complex fracture systems. Most single continuum methods consider single-phase upscaling only, and treat the upscaled permeabilities as tensor terms. The dual continuum approach (8-11) is based on the double porosity model of Warren (12) and Root, and its representation in the simulation of fractured reservoirs (13) . The dual continuum upscaling therefore requires determination of the properties required for double porosity simulation of the fractured system. Most of upscaling research concentrates on obtaining equivalent properties for a single-porosity simulation of a fractured system. Upscaled single-porosity models do not exhibit some of the important characteristics of naturally fractured reservoirs. In particular, a single-porosity model cannot distinguish between the displacing fluid fronts in the fracture and the matrix. The dual continuum approach, however, includes the physics for modeling unsteady-state multiphase fluid exchange between the rock matrix and fractures. In this work, we will obtain the equivalent double-porosity parameters for a tracer displacement in a fractured porous medium. In the following, the upscaling framework, including fractured systems used in our study, is presented first. The upscaling methodology and results are described in detail.

AB  - Summary Gullfaks has been in production since 1986 and produces approximately 11 500 std m3/d of oil from three Condeep platforms. The average water cut is approximately 75 to 80% and gas/oil ratio (GOR) is approximately 200 std m3/std m3. It has been estimated that between 50 and 100 t of sand is produced yearly per platform, with approximately 60 to 70% of the wells in active production (approximately 90) limited by sand production. The typical well completion is cased hole with selective production through perforated liners. Rock-mechanics studies have shown that sand will be produced irrespective of well inclination and perforation design. On Gullfaks, the sand-management strategy used has been to produce wells at "maximum" or "acceptable" sand rates. This strategy has led to significant gains in production, although there are challenges with this approach that include choke erosion, sand removal from the separators, and oil-in-water quality associated with discharge to sea. In response to this, Statoil has investigated different methods of retaining sand downhole by chemical sand consolidation, of which in-situ calcium carbonate (CaCO3) precipitation will form the basis for this paper. This technology involves squeezing into the near-wellbore formation predefined concentrations of urea and calcium nitrate along with the enzyme urease. After application, the well is shut in, during which the enzyme catalyzes the decomposition of urea to bicarbonate that reacts with calcium to form calcium carbonate. This paper will provide details of the laboratory evaluation and, in particular, will focus on the field results from the first-ever application of this type. A low-risk candidate well was selected that had a short perforated interval (19 m) and produced 88 std m3/d oil with a water cut of 94%. Results of the operation design and planning, logistics examination, thorough risk evaluation, and post-operation results with lessons learned will be presented.

AB  - AbstractIn this paper we discuss the main experimental results obtained during the field verification tests of the Well Flow Analyser (WFA). The WFA is a multiphase flow meter developed by SENSORTEKNIKK (Norway) and ENI, with the support of NORSK AGIP and STATOIL. The WFA predicts the flow rates of each component (oil, water, gas) in the multiphase stream, by analysing the noise generated by the fluid when passing across a choke valve. The instrument has been tested extensively in real conditions in the Trecate test loop which is located in the Trecate - Villafortuna oil field, at about 60 Km from Milan. The system used for the tests is relatively simple: it consists of an acoustic sensor installed on a Willis choke and a signal processing unit controlled by a personal computer.We highlight the main technical challenges that have been overcome and the performance of the instrument, as a result of the tests carried out in Trecate along 1997.The development of the instrument required the application of advanced processing techniques, such as digital signal processing algorithms (Fast Fourier Transform, Wavelet transform), multivariate statistical analysis and the use of neural network models, to extract the information related to the multiphase flow from the acoustic spectra. The resulting instrument has been tested on a broad range of oil, gas and water flow conditions, providing flow rate estimations with an average error of 5%-15%.Finally, we describe the benefits related to the application of the WFA to well testing measurements, as well as the problems related to its calibration.P. 429

AB  - Summary In this study we estimated the initial effective fracture pore volume (Vfi) and fracture volume loss (dVef) for 21 wells completed in the Montney and Eagle Ford formations. We also evaluated the relationship between dVef and choke size. First, we applied rate-decline analysis to water-flowback data of candidate wells to estimate the ultimate water recovery volume, approximated as Vfi. Second, we estimated dVef using a fracture compressibility relationship to evaluate the fracture volume loss of the Eagle Ford wells. Third, we investigated the effect of choke size on dVef for the Eagle Ford fastback and slowback wells. Semilog plots of flowback water rate vs. cumulative water volume show straight-line trends, representing a harmonic decline. The estimated Vfi accounts for approximately 84 and 26% of the total injected water volume (TIV) of the Montney and Eagle Ford wells, respectively. The results show that approximately 10% of the fracture volume is lost during flowback. This loss in fracture volume predominantly happens during the early flowback and becomes minimal during the late flowback period. The results show a relatively higher dVef for fastback (a flowback process with a relatively large choke size) wells compared with that for slowback (a flowback process with a relatively small choke size) wells. In this study we proposed a method to estimate the initial fracture volume and investigated the loss in fracture volume during the flowback process. Analyses of the field data led to an improved understanding of the factors that control water flowback and the effective fracture volume.

AB  - Abstract Gas injection is one of the key enhanced oil recovery (EOR) methods. Significant volumes of the residual oil, remaining after earlier EOR methods, has been reported to be recovered through the gravity drainage mechanism, following the crestal gas injection in the horizontal, dipping or reef type oil reservoirs. The rate of oil recovery is controlled by the viscous/capillary/gravity forces, the rate of gas injection and oil production, the difference of oil and gas density, the oil relative permeability, the oil viscosity and number of other operational parameters. Risk analysis of these parameters helps to identify their relative dominance during gas-oil gravity drainage process. The interactions between various process controlling parameters is studied through development of scaling groups that govern the displacement process. Functional relationships between those scaling groups and their effect on the overall performance of immiscible gas-driven gravity drainage EOR are investigated in this study. This enables an estimation of fractional oil recovery for the combinations of scaling groups. The results of numerical sensitivity analysis through the reservoir simulations are presented to map the effective combinations of the dimensionless scaling groups for gas-oil gravity drainage EOR method. Introduction Gas injection either in the immiscible or miscible mode (largely CO2) is the key process amongst the major contending methods of enhancing oil recovery. It can be carried out either in secondary or tertiary stage of the producing life of the reservoir in continuous mode, alternating cycles of water and gas or in gravity drainage mode. Continuous gas injection methods are largely impaired by the viscous instabilities, the severe gas-oil gravity segregation and the poor volumetric sweep efficiency. Moreover, the larger difference of the density between the injected gas and the in-situ reservoir fluid leads to severe gravity segregation effects. The cumulative effect is an uncontrolled gas flood front leading to the premature gas breakthrough in the producing wells and the unfavorable mobility ratio culminating into the severe viscous fingering. Further modifications in the injection modes could not completely eliminate these recovery impeding factors. Therefore, a method that uses the natural density based gravity segregation of the fluids to recover the bypassed oil in the unswept regions looks to be a more promising option. Gravity forces are recognized to play an important role at nearly every stage of the producing life of the reservoir, whether it is primary depletion, secondary water or gas injection scheme or tertiary enhanced or improved oil recovery methods. They always compete with the viscous (flow rate per unit area) forces and the capillary (ratio of the fluid/fluid forces to the grain size) forces occurring in porous media in addition to the vertical barriers in the form of heterogeneity. In presence of these impeding factors less dense fluid gets trapped in the producing zone, further diminishing the oil recovery performance. Conversely, gravity forces can be taken into advantage through the gravity drainage mechanism to maximize oil recovery from the oil bearing zone under investigation. A number of investigations carried out in the laboratories and in the field (Bangla et al., 1991; Chatzis et al., 1988; Da Sle and Guo, 1990; Kulkarni and Rao, 2006) suggest the significance of the gas-oil gravity drainage process in view of the higher oil recoveries obtained in contrast to the conventional gas injection EOR methods. Gravity drainage by gas injection is commonly implemented in either dipping or pinnacle reef type reservoirs. Current study focuses on the application of the gas-assisted gravity-drainage mechanism to a horizontal type reservoir through the combination of the vertical injectors and horizontal production wells.

AB  - AbstractThe study of fracture initiation from a cavity in rock has been largely motivated by the extraction of petroleum and natural gas from a borehole and therefore, is often considered as one of the most challenging problems in rock mechanics. An unresolved issue is relating the fracture parameters from small scale laboratory test to a large scale engineering process. To investigate fracture initiation from a borehole, cavity expansion tests were conducted in the laboratory on specimens of Berea sandstone. To capture the failure process near the circular cavity, digital image correlation (DIC) was used. In addition, a two dimensional bonded particle model was developed and validated. For investigating the effect of scaling on fracture parameters (e.g. critical pressure), several larger specimens with different tension softening behavior were tested numerically. It was shown that size plays an important role. Furthermore, using the DIC measurements, it was found that fracture initiates at 80% of peak internal pressure for the rock tested.1. INTRODUCTIONThe expansion of a circular cavity, such as a production well in rock, has been of considerable interest for decades. However, some aspects of fracturing have not been fully addressed. For example, in the interpretation of the critical (breakdown) pressure for hydraulic fracturing, the peak of the recorded pressure data is often assumed to be associated with tensile fracture initiation. The significant non linearity in the variation of the borehole diameter with breakdown pressure suggests fracturing prior to peak [1]. In this study, using a particle tracking technique named digital image correlation (DIC), a displacement discontinuity at the cavity boundary was identified. It was noticed that a fracture (process zone) develops prior to peak pressure. Another important issue in the problem of borehole expansion is the discrepancy between theoretical predictions and lab/field measurements regarding a size (and rate) effect. Many previous studies demonstrate that a rate effect strongly exists and that the faster the loading, the higher the breakdown pressure [2- 6]. Size effect on the critical load required to initiate a tensile (mode I) fracture in a quasi-brittle material is well known [7], and therefore, understanding the mechanism associated with mode I fracture initiation from a wellbore is important. Previous studies have confirmed that with increase in size, the critical pressure decreases [2, 8]. A recent study [9] demonstrated that the size effect is governed by the ratio between a material length scale and a structural length scale. The material length is defined as the square of the ratio of the fracture toughness to its tensile strength, while the structural length scale is the wellbore radius.

AB  - Summary Fracturing-fluid invasion into the rock matrix can generate water block that potentially reduces hydrocarbon production, especially in low-permeability reservoirs. Here, we experimentally investigate the dynamics of water block under different flow scenarios (i.e., without shut-ins) and rock permeabilities through multiple coreflood experiments. A computed-tomography (CT) scanner is used to obtain the saturation profile within the core throughout the experiment, while the overall hydrocarbon productivity is measured from the overall pressure drop across the core. On the basis of the saturation and pressure measurements, we interpret the potential physical mechanism regarding the productivity reduction from water block and its self-mitigation facilitated by the capillary imbibition. Our interpretation also matches the observed scaling with rock permeability and the optimal shut-in time.

A globe type valve was installed at the upper part of the vertical riser to control the flow rate and the gas was injected through the injection points in the horizontal section. When changing the gas-liquid ratio at the gas injection point, different type of slugging was observed, such as severe slugging, oscillation, and combination of both, were observed at the boundary between slugging and stable condition. Based on the observation, the stability map for the flowloop was developed to provide flow patterns under different ranges of superficial velocity of liquid and gas. Moreover, it was observed that when injecting gas at the point downstream of the liquid pump, the pressure of the flowloop showed a flow regime of dual frequency severe slugging, which is a combination of high frequency fluctuation and low frequency oscillation. When injecting gas through the other two points, only severe slugging fluctuation was observed, however the slug growth pattern was different depending on the superficial liquid velocity.The opening of the inlet valve was manually controlled to confirm that severe slugging was mitigated. A bifurcation diagram was made to more clearly identify which flow this system has at each valve opening. Bifurcation diagrams have been used to plot the values of pressure versus the values of valve opening for the slugging system. Valve opening at the point where the severe slugging flow changes to stable flow is expressed as critical valve opening. Experimental results show that severe slugging disappears at the opening below the critical valve opening, and that various critical valve opening values ranging from 0.3 to 0.7 are obtained depending on the liquid and gas flow rates. OLGA, a multiphase flow simulation software, was used to model the obtained experimental results. The simulation results showed the deviation for the amplitude of gas tank pressure was within 5% and the deviation for the period was within 10% under severe slugging formation.

AB  - Abstract Time-lapse seismic has been providing valuable information on identifying fluid movements, to locate bypassed oil and well placement optimization to reduce uncertainties in reservoir development and production management. Nevertheless, most of these are made through a qualitative approach, which limits seismic data integration in reservoir simulation studies due to different scales. In order to overcome this and develop new data integration techniques, many studies involving these processes have the assumption that both frameworks are in the same scale. Nonetheless, the quantification of the lost information in the scaling procedures needs to be evaluated and quantitative seismic data integration into the simulator should improve the mitigation of these problems improving the knowledge about the representativeness of the scaled data. In this context, it is presented a technique regarding to scale issues relating time-lapse seismic data, geological and simulation models aiming to quantify the information lost due to the scaling problems. This paper describes a methodology involving seismic attributes and reservoir simulation. Saturation and pressure trends derived from acoustic impedance behavior, which were obtained from seismic data. The lost information due to scaling procedures is evaluated through comparison between flux model properties and seismic attributes, at each respective framework, for estimating the best step to do it. This technique allowed the reliability improvement of the reservoir parameters from seismic attributes regarding to the lost information due to scaling procedures. It has been shown that it is possible to improve the model and results reliability through a quantitative analysis involving scaling procedures between 4D seismic data and reservoir simulation integrated studies. As main contributions of this technique are the integration procedures regarding to scaling issues between reservoir simulation models and time-lapse seismic information. Introduction Time-lapse data, or 4D seismic, is the process of repeating 3D seismic surveys over a producing reservoir in time-lapse mode. It has a potentially large impact in reservoir engineering due to its capability to estimate dynamic reservoir properties such as fluid movement, pressure build-up, and heat flow in reservoirs. Seismic images are sensitive to spatial contrasts in two distinct types of reservoir properties: (1) non-time-varying static geology properties such as lithology, porosity, shale content; and (2) time-varying dynamic fluid-flow properties such as fluid saturation, pore pressure and temperature. Given a single 3D seismic survey, representing a single snapshot in time of the reservoir, the static geology and the dynamic fluidflow contributions to the seismic image are non-uniquely coupled and therefore difficult to separate. However, time-lapse studies allow the static geologic contributions to cancel, resulting in a direct image of the time-varying changes caused by the reservoir fluid flow. Aiming an integration process of time-lapse data into the reservoir simulation, the 4D seismic technology appeared to reduce uncertainties from qualitative analysis (Lumley and Behrens, 1997; Pagano et al. 2000; Elde at al., 2000; O'Donovan et al., 2000; Fagervik et al., 2001; Aggio and Burns, 2000, Hatchell et al., 2002 and Pannett et al., 2004), identifying water saturation front, resulting in a great improvement in reservoir characterization and consequently in the history matching. In spite of being very usefull, they can lead erroneous analysis, being indispensable an additional procedure to better use the information of this technology.

AB  - Abstract This study shows the application of scaling analysis in the context of CO2 storage. Scaling analysis has been used in many flooding processes to characterize the displacement in such systems. The study aims to derive the key dimensionless numbers pertinent to CO2 storage in saline aquifers. This set of dimensionless numbers may be used to characterize important storage characteristics such as injectivity, plume migration and mobility, the pressure response and the ultimate storage capacity in potential saline aquifers. CO2 storage in a two-dimensional cross-sectional model representing part of a saline aquifer was considered. The model is assumed to be full of brine when CO2 is injected into it. The fundamental equations for the material conservation of each phase, and the transport equations were formulated and derived. All fluids and the formation were considered compressible. These fundamental equations were then converted into the dimensionless domain by applying inspectional analysis to allow the identification of the key dimensionless numbers characterizing the storage process. The storage process in such a system can be described by twelve dimensionless numbers, each of which characterize a different aspect of the storage process. Some numbers are similar to those already observed in the context of petroleum processes while a few of them are solely relevant to the storage process. Importantly, the pressure response and the injectivity consideration of the storage process can be described by the injectivity number and the ratio of compressibilities. A numerical model was constructed to test the sensitivity of the storage process with respect to these dimensionless numbers. Results show the same set of dimensionless numbers can describe storage performance in different systems as long as the processes in all of them are described by identical dimensionless numbers. The lateral migration of the plume and its onset arrival at the storage boundary can be described by the combination of the magnitudes of gravity numbers, effective aspect ratio number, mobility ratio between CO2 and brine and finally the ratio of CO2 and formation compressibilities relative to brine compressibility. For a confined storage system, the storage efficiency was correlated with the magnitudes of the influencing dimensionless numbers. The derived dimensionless numbers may be used as a set of characterization parameters for describing the storage process in potential storage candidates. They can also be used effectively as a preliminary screening criteria for the purpose of site selection amongst potential storage candidates.

AB  - Abstract This paper presents a rigorous method to scale rate-time profiles of multi-fractured horizontal wells (MFHW) to a set of reference reservoir and completion properties. Scaling is required for development of accurate production forecasts and typical well production profiles (type wells) with minimum uncertainty. We use a modified version of commonly-used type curves, notably the Wattenbarger type curve, to fit production data. The fit requires that production profiles exhibit a negative half slope during transient linear flow followed by negative unit slope during boundary-dominated flow on a rate vs. material balance time plot. The horizontal and vertical displacement required to fit observed data to the type curve define the scaling factors for individual wells. We present a set of equations to scale a given well's production profile to that of a reference well with specified effective permeability, fracture length, lateral length, net-pay thickness, drawdown, and fracture stage spacing. Just as we can scale a group of wells to common reference conditions, we can also rescale to predict the performance of a well with specified properties, such as average properties determined from wells analyzed or wells with completion designs different from those analyzed. While it is common and clearly important to normalize (scale) rate profiles for lateral length, we demonstrate that it is also crucial to scale production profiles in rate and time to account for differences in permeability, fracture spacing and thus, the duration of flow regimes. We provide examples of successful scaling based on publically reported production data from Marcellus, Barnett, Niobrara, Midland Basin (Wolfcamp) and Eagle Ford resource plays. Most of the methods used to assess the performance of MFHW's in resource plays rely on having a statistically significant number of analogs. However, datasets of sufficient size are often either unavailable or limited by the large variety of completion designs and well performance characteristics. Our approach to scale production can dramatically increase the number of analogs available to characterize a geologically similar area and thus reduce the uncertainty in production forecasts.

AB  - We assert that a classification of gas flow regimes in shales that is widely accepted in the petroleum industry, may be inconsistent with the physics of high-pressure gas flow in capillaries. This classification follows from the 1946 work by Brown et al. (1946) that deals with the flow of gases in large industrial metal pipes, elbows and orifices under vacuum, with gas pressures of the order of 1 mm Hg or less. In another pioneering paper that year, Tsien (1946) analyzed the hypersonic flight of rockets in the thermosphere (above 50 miles of altitude), and established the widely accepted Knudsen flow regimes for the high-Reynolds, high-Mach flow of rarified gases. We show why both these papers are not quite applicable to flow of compressed gas in the hot, high-pressure shale pores with rough surfaces. In addition, it may be inappropriate to use the capillary tube metaphor to describe shale micropores or microcracks, simply because each is fed with gas by dozens or hundreds of intricately connected nanopores, which themselves may be slits rather than circular cylinders, and are charged with the dense, liquid-like gas. In the small-scale, low-velocity flows of gases, failure of the standard Navier-Stokes description (the standard Darcy law in petroleum engineering) can be quantified by the Knudsen number, ratio of the mean free path, λ, of gas molecules at the reservoir pressure and temperature to the characteristic pore radius, R. We carefully enumerate the multiple restrictive conditions that must hold for the slip-flow boundary condition to emerge. We also describe the dependence of the slip correction factor on the gas pressure and temperature, as well as the median pore size and rock roughness. In the derivation, we revisit the original approaches of Helmholtz and von Piotrowski (1860) and Maxwell, Niven (1890), which were somehow lost in the multiple translations from physics to petroleum engineering. For example, in Barnett mudrocks, naturally occurring pores are predominantly associated with organic matter and pyrite framboids. In organic matter, the median pore length is 100 nm, Loucks et al. (2009), and the pore radii are likely to be between 1 and 10 nm, Clarkson et al. (2013). Other thermally mature mudrocks may be similar, Ross and Bustin (2009), or not, Clarkson et al. (2013). With R = 50 nm, the ratio of λ/R is less than 0.1 for pressures exceeding 60 bars. When we compare the actual slip-flow correction with the accepted classification of gas flow regimes, there is an order of magnitude discrepancy. It appears that our new classification is conservative for pores larger than 5 nm in radius. Therefore, unless the fraction of gas molecules that are bounced off diffusively from the rough pore walls is very low, slip flow is unlikely to dominate in shales. The generally accepted "Knudsen-diffusion" in shales is based on a mistranslation of the flow physics and may give theoretically unsound predictions of the increased permeability of shales to gas flow. This increase of permeability is real, and it comes from the micropores, fine-scale microfractures and cracks. The nanopores in shales provide gas storage by sorption and capillary condensation of heavier gas components. In the smallest nanopores even methane molecules are increasingly ordered and resemble more liquid than gas. These nanopores feed the macroscopic flow paths in ways that are not captured well by the generally accepted equations.

AB  - Abstract The screening and design of chemical flood processes requires an understanding of the effects of each chemical slug on oil recovery. The concept of volumetric linear scaling can be extended to processes involving the injection of multiple chemical slugs as long as the relative ratios of slug sizes are held constant. This allows fast development of the relation between oil recovery and slug size requirements for each chemical injected based on only a few laboratory linear floods. Linear floods were conducted in a synthetic water-wet matrix. The multiple slug scaling approach used oil saturation distributions measured by microwave attenuation in one laboratory flood to predict accurately the tertiary residual oil saturation and tertiary oil breakthrough in another laboratory linear flood run with larger slug sizes. Oil saturation distributions at 0.11 V/V p intervals during the flood, as well as at S , were also accurately predicted. A laboratory quarter five-spot pattern flood involving sequential injection of a small surfactant slug, a small polymer slug, and continuous drive water was run in a water-wet synthetic matrix. Linear flood oil saturation distributions were scaled to predict the oil saturation distributions in the pattern using a fixed twelve streamtube model for the flow. Details of this scaling procedure are given. Residual tertiary oil saturation, tertiary recovery, and oil saturation changes with time were predicted to within the experimental errors involved in the procedures. predicted to within the experimental errors involved in the procedures. The observed tertiary oil breakthrough was later than predicted. Observed oil saturation distributions tended to show more oil left in the corners of the model than predicted by the scaling theory. These secondary effects and the overall behavior of the pattern flood are considered in terms of the chosen streamtube network and the assumptions of stable unit mobility flow. Introduction The concept of volumetric linear scaling has beer used to predict linear core oil saturation distributions and oil recovery behavior for a single surfactant slug followed by continuous polymer injection . It has been extended to predict laboratory quarter five-spot tertiary oil recovery for a single surfactant slug followed by a continuous polymer injection. This work will extend volumetric linear scaling to multiple slug recovery processes in both linear and pattern laboratory floods. processes in both linear and pattern laboratory floods. Scaled laboratory multiple slug floods can be a source of information on the effect of the polymer slug on tertiary oil recovery for stable or nearly stable displacement. The polymer slug affects oil recovery on both a microscopic and a macroscopic scale. Microscopic polymer effects, like surfactant effects, can be studied in laboratory linear floods monitored by microwave as long as the requirements of volumetric linear scaling are met. These include (1) the existence of chemical similarity, (2) the unimportance of mixing, dispersion, gravity, or core cross-sectional geometry, and (3) the existence of equilibrium for adsorption, desorption and phase behavior processes. Volumetric linear scaling can be extended to multiple slug processes. Volumetric linear scaling can be extended to multiple slug processes as long as the relative slug sizes are held constant. The processes as long as the relative slug sizes are held constant. The effects of all chemical slugs on oil recovery may be investigated in a few floods by varying the relative slug sizes injected. p. 611

AB  - Abstract   Hydrochloric acid (HCl) is commonly used to remove wellbore damage and to enhance near-wellbore formation permeability in carbonate formations.  Although in most cases the spent acid is recovered rapidly during well flow back after the treatment, in heterogeneous reservoirs some of the spent acid can remain trapped for long periods becoming fully saturated with CaCO3 under downhole conditions.  These reservoir-saturated spent acids then lead to scaling when eventually unloaded into the production system. This paper describes a modelling and laboratory study to replicate the system, to allow selection of inhibitors which are effective against carbonate scales in spent acid solutions containing extremely high levels of Ca2+/Mg2+, and also remain stable at elevated temperatures in the spent acids.   The work also examined chemical retention and release via coreflood testing followed by field application modelling to select effective scale inhibitors (SI) which possess poor retention properties on the carbonate substrate thereby remaining present in the ??spent acid??.   One significant challenge associated with this study was the ability to reproduce the mildly oversaturated field scaling environment in the laboratory.  When using these fully saturated (with respect to CaCO3) partially acidic brines, very small changes in the brine chemistry or preparation procedures had a significant impact on scaling.  A detailed evaluation of brine preparation, stabilisation and buffering was therefore required prior to evaluating generic scale inhibitors for performance under these extreme conditions leading to selection of appropriate species.  The second stage of the work then involved core test procedures to determine those chemicals that offered minimal retention properties on the reservoir along with performance. This paper will present the field scaling challenges observed due to unloading of trapped spent acids; describe challenges faced within the laboratory in reproducing these conditions and present results from generic chemical types which are effective at preventing scale under these extreme conditions.  From the shortlisted products further results are presented demonstrating those which offer poor retention, which is generally the opposite of what is required for conventional scale inhibitor squeeze treatments, allowing selection for upcoming field trials in the selected field system.

AB  - Abstract: Experimental work suggests that the flow-stiffness relationship in single fractures relies on the geometry of the fracture, i.e. the size and spatial distributions of the void and contact areas. It is useful to understand the scaling of these distributions in relation to the hydromechanical properties of fractures to enable the extrapolation of understanding from studies conducted on small laboratory samples to behavior on the field scale. In this study, we uncover the difficulties associated with interpreting measurements taken in the laboratory and show that the scaling is in fact fundamentally different than that of the field. Finite-size scaling methods were used to extract critical thresholds for uncorrelated fractures under load and flow exponents were extracted.

AB  - SummaryDispersion and convection scaling can be used to model miscible andimmiscible flows, respectively, but these scaling techniques fail inmultidimensional heterogeneous permeability distributions. The lengthdependence observed for dispersion induced by correlated heterogeneity inmiscible displacement processes precludes the definition of an effectivedispersion coefficient. Effective relative permeabilities can be defined thatwill reproduce the results of the cross-sectional simulations from which theywere derived, but complications arise when they are used in areal models.IntroductionThe study of reservoir heterogeneity and its influence on oil recovery hasreceived more attention recently. The issues that arise in modeling flow inheterogeneous reservoirs can be placed in four categories.1. Geologic quantification: quantitative specification of fluid flowproperties includes statistical measurements of variation and spatialcorrelation. 2. Data integration: data from different sources and measured atdifferent scales am combined at different degrees of reliability, resolution,and spatial sampling into a reservoir model consistent with all the availabledata and their spatial structures. 3. Numerical rocks: simulations of geologicproperty distributions at arbitrary resolutions that reproduce measured dataand statistical correlation measurements. 4. Scale-up: definition of effectiveflow properties for coarse-grid, finite-difference simulations or streamtubescaling methods for field-scale performance predictions.This paper focuses on scale-up by reviewing the scaling behavior of miscibleand immiscible displacements to determine the validity of defining effectiveflow properties to represent the effects of permeability heterogeneity onfrontal displacements. We show that heterogeneity effects on miscible processescannot be reduced to an effective dispersion coefficient or be modeled with anappropriate level of numerical dispersion. Heterogeneity effects on immiscibledisplacements can be captured in pseudoreladve-penneability functions, buttheir use entails many complications and restrictions that have not beendiscussed previously. These restrictions, which include maintaining the samecell previously. These restrictions, which include maintaining the same cellsize and streamwise sequence and using the same initial saturation distributionas the cross section from which they were derived, will be shown.First, it is necessary to develop scaling laws for 1D displacementprocesses. These scaling laws form the basis for scaling the equivalentprocesses. These scaling laws form the basis for scaling the equivalent 1D formof the heterogeneous cross-sectional results.Scaling Laws In Multiphase DisplacementThe 1D transport equation for multicomponent, multiphase flow in a porousmedium is(1)(2)(3)(4)(5)(6)(7)Fi = fractional flux of Component i, which depends on the relativepermeabilities and viscosities of Phase j, which, in turn, dependpermeabilities and viscosities of Phase j, which, in turn, depend only on thelocal fluid compositions, Ci. Di = the dispersive flux of Component i, whichdepends on the dispersion coefficient of Component i in Phase j, Kij. Thisequation includes the simplifying assumptions that the fluids and rock areincompressible and isothermal and that the fluids flowing through the mediumare in local thermodynamic equilibrium and do not go through chemicalreactions.In Eq. 1, the first term represents the local accumulation of Component i,the second term represents the net flux out of a local volume element byconvective fluid motion, and the right side represents the net flux into avolume element by dispersion in the phases. The scaling behavior ofdisplacement fronts depends on the phases. The scaling behavior of displacementfronts depends on the forms and relative magnitudes of the flux terms, whichcontain the transport properties, ki and Ki. If we consider displacements in asemi-infinite medium, (i.e., the downstream boundary is far enough away thatthe boundary condition does not influence local displacement behavior), thenthe only length scale is the mean displacement distance after a time to,L0=vt0. The relative magnitudes of the two flux terms then are given by thePeclet number, defined as(8)When diffusion is negligible compared with mechanical mixing in themicroscopic pore space, = , where = microscopic mixing length and(9)Measurements of or from outcrop sandstones show values typically greaterthan 0.5 cm, while measurements of in carbonates are more variable andtypically are in the 0.1- to 2-cm range. For typical interwell distances(greater than 200 m), Np greater than 10,000. In simulations withfinite-difference models, the truncation error effects introduce a numericaldispersion that, for small timesteps, scales as = , where N=number ofgridblocks along the flow directions. This means that in most flow simulations,numerical dispersion effects will be larger than properly scaled physicaldispersion.In defining effective flow properties to represent permeabilityheterogeneity effects, it must be understood that they can reproduce only thekinds of scaling behavior produced by the flux terms in Eq. 1.

AB  - AbstractReconciling data from different scales is a longstanding problem in reservoir characterization. Data from core plugs, well logs of different types, and seismic data must all be accounted for in the construction of a geostatistical reservoir model. These data are at vastly different scales and it is inappropriate to ignore the scale difference when constructing a geostatistical model.Geostatistical scaling laws were devised in the 1960s and 1970s primarily in the mining industry where the concern was mineral grades in selective mining unit (SMU) blocks of different sizes. These principles can be extended to address problems of core, log and seismic data. The adoption of these classic volume-variance or scaling relationships presents some challenges. Some specific concerns are (1) the ill-defined volume of measurement, (2) uncertainty in the small-scale variogram structure, and (3) non-linear averaging of many responses including acoustic properties and permeability.We demonstrate the application of volume-variance relations for upscaling and downscaling techniques to integrate data of different scales. Practical concerns are addressed with data from a chalk reservoir in the Danish North Sea. A direct sequential simulation algorithm accounting for data at all scales is documented.
