AB  - Abstract The quantity of gas accumulated as gas hydrates has been estimated as more than the half of the total fossil energy, and it is considered as the most prominent energy resource to cover the needs of natural gas in the future. Due to the limited data available, important efforts in the harvesting of real data have been carried out and additional simulation studies for this not conventional reservoir like gas hydrates accumulations are considered. The two main mechanisms to define the exploitation strategy are depressurization and thermal stimulation; and reservoir numerical simulation which are considered important tools to get characterization and evaluation of the optimization production process. A three-dimensional commercial numerical simulator is used to model gas production from gas hydrates dissociation, considering the thermodynamic equilibrium and the kinetic intrinsic, both simultaneously. Depending on the defined deposit configuration, gas hydrates accumulations can be associated a biphasic zone with gas free layer below the gas hydrates zone (deposits Class 1), and for this configuration gas production by depressurization is the most favorable one. The initial production from the free gas layer drives the process of dissociation of methane hydrates zone. In the case where the configuration includes the presence of an aquifer or mainly water in a biphasic zone below to the gas hydrates zone (deposits Class 2); the more often evaluated mechanism is hot water or steam injection as thermal stimulation behave like an acceptable alternative for gas production, the rise in temperature promotes the dissociation of the upper hydrates reaching temperatures to that of equilibrium condition. Gas production is associated with water production. Introduction Gas hydrates are considered as potential source of energy for the 21st century, because of the huge amount of gas stored in this form like gas hydrates accumulations. Some authors consider that hydrate accumulations exceed the worldwide reserves of conventional oil reservoirs, and gas and other accumulations of fossil energy sources such as coal. Most gas hydrates are formed in deep-marines or subsea sediments, or shallow to moderate depths in the Arctic regions. There is evidence, some of them have being evaluated and analyzed with greater emphasis, about the presence of ocean deposits of methane hydrates on the Atlantic and Pacific Ocean (Sawyer, et al., 2000, Röömer, 2004, Figueira, 2010) (Figure 1,2). Based on the possible locations of accumulations of Figure 1 some preliminary assessments (Röömer, 2004) with available data were carried out on the Continental Shelf of Venezuela. The study shows that there is the possibility that the gas hydrates accumulations could be present but cannot be identified in the seismic lines available. The main recommendation of the Röömer's study is to carried out a vast capture of information as it is the common practice for the oil conventional fields; it should provide available real information by drilling, for the acquisition of profiles and sampling, to verify and validate the interpreted seismic response at the given locations and then validate that it really corresponds to non-conventional deposits of methane hydrate.

AB  - Summary This study reviews how production of methane from hydrates can be triggered by dissociation of the hydrate structure. Techniques leading to dissociation of hydrates are summarized by pressure depletion, thermal stimulation, and injection of inhibitors. Depressurization is considered to be the most-cost-effective method and is easily implemented in gas reservoirs with overlying hydrate layers. Examples and status of pressure-depletion tests on field scale will be reviewed. In hydrate reservoirs not adjacent to gas zones, the success of pressure depletion is dependent on sufficient permeability to allow for pressure perturbations to reach within the hydrate reservoir and to allow for flow of dissociated gas. This effect has been investigated in this paper by performing controlled pressure depletions on hydrate-filled sandstone cores. Dissociation pressures at given temperatures have been quantified as well as recovery of methane as a function of pressure decrements lower than dissociation pressure. Hydrate dissociation was found to take place over a range of pressure values because of salinity changes in the water phase. A 2D porous silicon-wafer micromodel has been used to gain insight into the mechanisms of hydrate dissociation. Direct visualization of hydrate melting induced by both depressurization and heating is reported from pores replicating authentic sandstone pores. Thermal stimulation led to a more-uniform hydrate melting compared with pressure depletion, and depressurization was most effective when the hydrate was in direct contact with gas bubbles.

AB  - Abstract Formation of gas hydrates have been known to cause severe problems of blockages in natural gas pipelines, wellbores and natural gas processing units. Methanol and glycols are commonly used as hydrate inhibitors to control or prevent formation of gas hydrates, due to their ability to lower hydrate formation (or dissociation) temperatures considerably. For the same reason, they are very effective hydrate dissociation stimulants for enhancing gas production from hydrate reservoirs as demonstrated by a production from hydrate reservoirs as demonstrated by a field study in the Messoyakha gas hydrate reservoir of the Soviet Union (Makogon, 1981). Effect of these hydrate inhibitors on the thermodynamic phase behavior of gas hydrates has been well established, however, no experimental data exist on effect of inhibitors on the rate of hydrate formation or dissociation. Hence, the current methods of prevention of hydrate formation by inhibitors have relied upon the thermodynamic data rather than kinetic data. In this study, the characteristics of hydrate dissociation process during methanol and ethylene glycol injection were Investigated. After formation of methane hydrates in the synthetic cores, hydrates were dissociated by injection of inhibitor solution of known initial concentration, at a constant rate. The pressure was held constant during dissociation and gas production, inhibitor solution temperature and dissociating hydrate front position were monitored continuously. Experimental position were monitored continuously. Experimental results show that the instantaneous rate of hydrate dissociation is function of inhibitor concentration, inhibitor injection rate, pressure, temperature of inhibitor solution and hydrate-inhibitor interfacial (contact) area. Based upon the unsteady state dissociation data, empirical correlations for the rate of hydrate dissociation in presence of inhibitors are developed. The correlations can presence of inhibitors are developed. The correlations can be used to compute the degree of enhancement in the rate of hydrate dissociation by inhibitors in applications such as hydrate prevention or production of natural gas from hydrates. METHANOL AND GLYCOLS AS HYDRATE INHIBITORS Gas hydrates are clathrate compounds in which each water molecule forms hydrogen bonds with it's four nearest water molecules to build a solid crystalline lattice structure, that encages gas molecules in it's Interstitial cavities. In 1934, Hammerschmidt determined that these solid gas hydrates form during transportation of natural gas and cause severe problems of blockages in pipelines. Since then, several methods of prevention of formation of gas hydrates were developed. The most commonly employed industrial methods include: removal of moisture content of natural gas by dew point lowering method, heating of a section containing hydrate plug to raise it's temperature above hydrate dissociation temperature, depressurization of a hydrate plug simultaneously from both ends at a slow rate to a pressure below hydrate dissociation pressure, and injection of chemicals which act as hydrate inhibitors into the gas flow stream, Makogon (1981) and Sloan (1990) provide comprehensive reviews of these processes. The term "hydrate inhibitor" is used for those chemicals which have ability to lower hydrate formation temperature (or shift hydrate equilibria). These chemicals include: methanol, glycols, ammonia, salts such as chlorides of sodium, potassium, calcium and magnesium. Several studies have been reported in literature which provide experimental data on effect of inhibitor provide experimental data on effect of inhibitor concentration on the thermodynamic phase equilibria of gas hydrates. Makogon (1981) and Sloan (1990) provide good review of these studies and a discussion on effectiveness and screening of these inhibitors for hydrate prevention. In general, the degree of inhibition, for hydrate prevention. In general, the degree of inhibition, for hydrate lowering of hydrate formation temperature) is function of the type of inhibitor, inhibitor concentration, pressure and composition of hydrate forming gas.

AB  - ABSTRACTIn this study, an artificial methane hydrate sediment sample is experimentally made based on a two-dimensional vessel with 320mm×320mm in cross section and 28mm in height. a sequence of experiments on MH dissociation behaviors by addition of ethylene glycol (EG) aqueous solution under varying concentration and injection flux and as well different production mode(Single-well or Multi-mode) are carried out. Special pressure behavior at the early stage of injection is attributable to the high MH saturation after completion of the formation. It suggests that higher solution concentration and the injection rate can facilitate cumulative gas production. However, gas production cannot sufficiently benefit from inhibitor injection with higher concentration as far as the input energy is concerned according to the energy-efficiency analysis. Multi-well mode shows its superiority over Single-well mode in terms of total gas production and Productivity as well. The variations of temperature field with the time elapsing reflected directly the advancement of hydrate dissociation front. It is difficult to produce all the MH in a reservoir simply with thermodynamic inhibitor injection because it gets harder for inhibitor solution to reach to remaining hydrate effectively.INTRODUCTIONNatural gas hydrates are crystalline compounds that can contain a large amount of natural gas (Sloan, 1998). NGH are treated as a potential energy resource for the 21st century because a large amount of methane gas is trapped in hydrate reservoirs both onshore buried under the permafrost and offshore buried under the oceanic and deep lake sediments (Makogon, 1981; Okuda, 1993; Gornitz and Fung, 1994; Kvenvolden K, 2000; Collett, T. S, 2002; Kerr, R. A, 2004).The success coring of gas hydrate in South China Sea in 2007 confirms the existence of hydrate in Shenhu sea area. Therefore, developing methods for commercial production of natural gas from hydrate reservoirs is attracting considerable attention.

AB  - ABSTRACT:The development of the stresses and displacements in the seabed caused by the dissociation of gas hydrate were numerically simulated by using the software ABAQUS. The effects of the dissociation size and the sustaining strength of the gas hydrate sediment after dissociation on the responses of the sediment were mainly investigated. It is shown that the deformation and the stresses in the seabed increased with the expansion of the gas hydrate dissociation size. The sediment will subsequently lose the stability or even slide when the strength of the gas hydrate sediment decreases and the gas hydrate dissociation size increases to some extent. INTRODUCTIONNatural gas hydrate is a crystalline solid usually occurring in deep ocean and permafrost. It has been estimated being of two times as much as the carbon resources on the Earth and thought as a kind of new potential energy in the 21st century. The gas hydrate dissociation in the seabed, which is usually due to the increase of the temperature or the decrease of the pressure, can cause the seabed settle or even slide. Therefore, it is very important to investigate the responses of the dissociation of gas hydrate on the stability of seabed. Some researchers thought that the Storegga slide in Norway (Locat et al, 2002; Hovland et al, 2001), Cape Fear slide in east coast of America and the landslide in the continental shelf of West Africa (Kayer et al, 1991; Sultan et al, 2004) and some other slides (Gilles et al, 1999) were all caused by gas hydrate dissociation. However, previous researches on this kind of landslides were almost based on geophysics and geochemistry investigation data (Paull et al, 2003; Bunz et al, 2003; Rao et al, 2002), but less researches were on the mechanism.

AB  - ABSTRACTWe have developed a field scale simulator to analysis the physical phenomena in methane hydrate reservoir and predict gas production behavior in the process of hydrate dissociation. Absolute permeability and relative permeability with hydrate formation were formulated with measuring data and introduced into the simulator. Based on the experimental results in laboratory for hydrate dissociation by hot water injection, the validity of the simulator was demonstrated. Using this simulator, some field scale simulation run for hot water injection as a thermal stimulation methods was carried out to consider the effect of permeability distribution and anisotropy on dissociation and gas production behavior. From calculation results, it was found that 1) high permeable zone was formed in the reservoir, 2) injected water flew in this zone, so that dissociation was promoted, depending on the these parameters.INTRODUCTIONMethane hydrate is ice-like solid substance in which water molecule structure contains embedded methane molecules under low-temperature and high-pressure conditions (Sloan, 1998). When 1 m3 of MH is decomposed, about 150m3 of methane gas is produced. MH is one of the potential resources of natural gas in the near future, because the large amount of reservoir exists in marine sediments or in permafrost regions worldwide (Okuda, 1993; Sato, 2001). Some extraction methods of gas hydrates from the reservoir in marine sediments has been proposed, such as depressurization, thermal stimulation and inhibitor injection. These are all based on the in-situ dissociation process of gas hydrates that is transformed into methane gas and water. Only methane gas can be produced from the reservoirs in marine sediments. To evaluate the productivity of methane gas from the reservoirs, it is necessary to develop the production simulator and carry out parameter study by using the simulator. Fig.1 illustrates the outline of research for gas hydrate extraction from marine sediments.

AB  - Abstract A preserved sample of hydrate-bearing sandstone from the Mount Elbert Test Well was dissociated by depressurization while monitoring the internal temperature of the sample in two locations and the density changes at high spatial resolution using x-ray CT scanning. The sample contained two distinct regions having different porosity and grain size distributions. The hydrate dissociation occurred initially throughout the sample as a result of depressing the pressure below the stability pressure. This initial stage reduced the temperature to the equilibrium point, which was maintained above the ice point. After that, dissociation occurred from the outside in as a result of heat transfer from the controlled temperature bath surrounding the pressure vessel. Numerical modeling of the test using TOUGH+HYDRATE yielded a gas production curve that closely matches the experimentally measured curve.   Introduction R ecent studies have concluded that methane hydrate (hereafter hydrate), a naturally occurring clathrate compound consisting of molecular water cages surrounding gas molecules (primarily methane), contains large quantities of methane in shallow sediments throughout the world's coastal margins and polar regions [Boswell et al., 2010; Milkov, 2004; Sloan et al., 1998]. Each cubic meter of hydrate can hold approximately 160 m3 of natural gas at standard temperature and pressure [National Resource Council, 2004]. Even though natural gas from hydrate shows great promise as an energy resource, scientific and engineering questions remain regarding producing gas from hydrates. Three methods are typically considered to produce gas from hydrate: depressurization, where the system pressure is lowered below the hydrate stability pressure; thermal stimulation, where the hydrate-bearing sediments are heated to temperatures in excess of the hydrate stability temperature, and the use of inhibitors such as sodium chloride or alcohols that modify the hydrate stability conditions to destabilize the hydrate [Sloan and Koh, 2008]. Of these techniques, heating the hydrate-bearing sediments and injecting expensive alcohols or corrosive brines may have limited applications, but will often be impractical, particularly considering the size of reservoirs and the lack of control that can be exerted to directly apply the heat or inhibitor to the location needed. Depressurization is expected to be effective in many situations, however the hydrate-bearing sediments must be well enough confined by low permeability strata for the depressurization to be effective.

AB  - Summary. This paper presents an analytic model that includes the effects of the presence of hydrates in a thermal recovery process. The model considers continuous injection of steam into a reservoir containing an oil zone overlain by a hydrate zone. The model results indicate that, although part of the steam is consumed in dissociation of hydrates to gas and water and the dissociated hydrate zone acts as a thief zone for steam, there is a reduction in heat losses to the overburden because of the "insulation" effect of overlying hydrates. Thus, the net reservoir heat efficiency is not significantly affected by the presence of hydrates. Although the model does not address the effect of gas generated from hydrate dissociation, it is speculated that the dissolution of the gas will cause oil swelling, oil-viscosity reduction, and improved steamflood performance. performance. Introduction The possibility of sharing the existing Kuparuk River Unit, North Slope, Alaska, facilities has made the future recovery of the heavy-oil sand in West Sak and tar sands in Ugnu a near-term target. West Sak sands alone contain about 15 x 10(9) to 25 x 10(9) bbl [2.4 x 10(9) to 4 x 10(9) m3] of Class 1 heavy crude (16 to 23API (0.96 to 0.92 g/cm3]), whereas the shallower, lower Ugnu formation contains 6 x 10(9) to 11 x 10(9) bbl [0.95 x 10(9) to 1.7 x 10(9) m3] of heavier Class 2 crude characterized as tar-sand bitumen. Recent studies indicate that the gas hydrates may also coexist with the shallower oils in the southwest updip portion of these reservoirs. The objective of this study was to develop an analytic model to evaluate the effects of the presence of gas hydrates on heavy-oil recovery during a steamflooding process. A steamdrive model has been modified to incorporate hydrate dissociation. For modeling purposes, a layered hydrate/oil configuration was considered. Various possible effects caused by the presence of gas hydrates are qualitatively discussed. An approximate analytic solution has been obtained for the complex hydrate dissociation heat-transfer problem. Temperature profiles in the hydrate zone, volume of dissociated hydrates, profiles in the hydrate zone, volume of dissociated hydrates, steam-zone volume, and moving hydrate-dissociation fronts have been determined analytically. To quantify the effects of the presence of gas hydrates on steamflood performance, three cases were studied. In the first case, a layered hydrate/oil configuration was considered. In the other two cases, a conventional steamflood without hydrates was considered. For all the cases, steam-zone growth, reservoir heat efficiency, cumulative oil recovery, and oil/steam ratios (OSR's) are computed and compared. Background The shallow West Sak and Ugnu sands in the Kuparuk River Unit contain 26 X 10(9) to 44 x 10(9) bbl [4.1 x 10(9) to 7 x 10(9) m3] of heavy crude. Because these heavy crude oils are not recoverable by primary and secondary recovery techniques, oil companies have developed BOR techniques. Arco Alaska, one of the major operators in the West Sak field, is concentrating on developing a commercial thermal recovery technique and has carried out a hot-waterflooding pilot. pilot. Features of Heavy-Oil Reservoirs, West Sak and Ugnu are the primary heavy-oil-bearing reservoirs in the Kuparuk River region. primary heavy-oil-bearing reservoirs in the Kuparuk River region. Oil-trapping mechanisms and geology for these reservoirs are described in Refs. 8 through 10. The deeper West Sak reservoir, a thin Cretaceous sand overlying the Kuparuk River pay zone, encompasses a 200- to 250-sg-mile [518- to 647-km2] area and is estimated to contain 15 x 10(9) to 25 x 10(9) bbl [2.4 x 10(9) to 4 x 10(9) m3] of heavy crude. These sands have been characterized as finegrained, quartzose, well-sorted, subangular, and very friable. This transitional unit extends from the underlying Upper Cretaceous marine shales of Seabee formation to the younger Upper Cretaceous nonmarine sandstone of Prince Creek formation. In West Sak Well 1, these sands occur in the interval at a measured depth of 3,744 to 4,040 It [1140 to 1230 m]. West Sak crudes exhibit very high sulfur content (1.82%), a C4 and lighter hydrocarbon yield of 0.63%, and API gravities of from 16 to 23API [0.96 to 0.92 g/cm3]. The reservoir porosity is less than 20%, and the permeability is 10 to 140 md. permeability is 10 to 140 md. The shallower Ugnu sands have been described as tar sands and are predominantly fine-to-medium-grained, well-sorted, quartz, chert, and volcanic rock fragments. The Ugnu sands are divided into two zones: the deeper zone (Lower Ugnu), estimated to contain 6 x 10(9) to 11 x 10(9) bbl [0.95 x 10(9) to 1.7 x 10(90 m3], and the shallower zone (Upper Ugnu), estimated to contain 5 x 10(9) to 8 x 10(9) bbl [0.8 x 10(9) to 1.3 x 10(9) m3] of tar-sand bitumen. The crude in these sands is much heavier (8 to 12API [1 to 0.99 g/cm3]) and biodegraded. The reservoir is highly permeable and has a porosity of 25%. Gas-Hydrate/Heavy-Oil Relationship. Gas hydrates are crystal-line, solid compounds composed of natural gas and water in which the gas molecules are enclathrated in the solid water lattice. The pressure and temperature conditions on the North Slope are suitable for gas-hydrate formation. Godbole et al. and Kamath et al. have determined the hydrate stability field on the North Slope. Although the areal extent of gas hydrate's in Ugnu and West Sak has not been delineated, several wells in these reservoirs have indicated the presence of gas hydrates. Holder et al., in a laboratory study, obtained crude oil samples from West Sak Well 1 and mixed it with natural gas, hexane, and decane. The gas/oil mixture was placed in a pressure cell, and hydrate-forming conditions and bubblepoint pressures were determined. Their study demonstrated that the loss of C1 to C4 fractions in the West Sak crude could have occurred as a result of gas-hydrate formation. Recently, Collett examined interrelationships between gas hydrates and heavy-oil occurrence in this field. His study showed that the gas hydrates are in conjunction with heavy oils in the southwest updip continuation of West Soak and Ugnu reservoirs. For these reasons, this study is aimed at determining the implications of the presence-of gas hydrates on heavy-oil recovery by thermal recovery techniques. SPERE

AB  - The dissociation behavior of an artificial hydrate core sample in an inhibitor aqueous solution (methanol aqueous solution) was investigated experimentally. A newly constructed experimental setup equipped with a core holder was used to investigate the dissociation behavior of the hydrate core sample under conditions similar to those below the seafloor. It was observed that an inhibitor that changes the hydrate stability condition is effective in accelerating the hydrate dissociation rate. In addition, it was observed that the temperature of the solution from the outlet of the core changes continuously, while the outlet temperature does not change in the case of pure water. This result suggests that the inhibitor concentration around the hydrate surface changes continuously. INTRODUCTION Natural gas hydrates are crystalline compounds that can contain a large amount of natural gas (Sloan, 1998). Owing to recent seismic exploration and geological research, it is widely known that the natural gas hydrate that exists in sediment constitutes a large natural gas resource expected to be a future energy source (Makogon, 1981; Brooks et al., 1986; Kvenvolden, 1988; Kvenvolden et al., 1993; Okuda, 1993; Gornitz and Fung, 1994; Sassen, 2001). To make the recovery of natural gas from hydrates commercially viable, hydrates must be dissociated in situ. The inhibitor injection method is thought to be one of the effective dissociation methods, as well as depressurization and thermal stimulation. However, there is only limited information about dissociation kinetics in inhibitors, while there exist substantial phase equilibrium data. In our previous study, the dissociation behavior of the pure methane hydrate (MH) in an inhibitor (ethylene glycol aqueous solution) was investigated using a pellet-type MH sample (Kawamura et al., 2003a, b). The results suggested that the dissociation rate was increased by ethylene glycol. Observations also suggested that water generated from the MH dissociation prevented MH from further contacting the inhibitor.

AB  - ABSTRACTThis experimental study evaluated the performance of sand control screens used to inhibit the production of sand accompanying hydrate dissociation by applying depressurization. Experimental apparatus was developed that visualizes the phenomenon of the production of sand and fine particles during hydrate dissociation. The sediment samples were prepared using sand the size distribution of which was similar to that of sandy layers in real hydrate fields. The screen sample was the same specification as that of a commercialized product used for well completion. In order to evaluate both gas production behavior and the performance of the screen sample according to hydrate dissociation by the application of depressurization, the internal pressure of sediment samples, amounts of water and gas produced, and imaging and photos of the sand-production phenomenon were observed on a real-time basis. Hydrate production behavior showed different results according to whether free gas was present. The results of the screen performance showed that sand production was not visibly observed in the screen sample, and the amount of sand collected after the experiment was less than 0.012% of the total mass of the sediment samples.

AB  - Summary. An analytical model that describes hydrate dissociation under thermal stimulation in porous media is presented. The model views the dissociation as a process in which gas and water are produced at a moving dissociation boundary. The boundary separates the dissociated zone containing gas and water from the undissociated zone containing the hydrate. A similarity solution to the conservation equations is derived, and results are presented in graphical forms that are useful in numerical computations. In particular, heat fluxes, temperature profiles, and gas pressure distributions are presented for two cases that simulate saturated-steam and hot-water thermal stimulation. A parametric study showed that the dissociation rate is a strong function of the thermal properties of the system and the porosity of the porous medium. The energy efficiency of the dissociation process, defined as the ratio of the heating value of the gas produced relative to the heat input, was also computed. For hydrate thermal stimulation, an energy efficiency value of about nine was found, which appears encouraging for natural gas production from hydrate. IntroductionSubstantial amounts of natural gas hydrates have been found in the earth's sediment beneath the permafrost in Arctic basins and in ocean-bottom sediments along the continental margins of the U.S. Because of this potential resource, the problems associated with the production of natural gas from these hydrate zones have become of greater interest to the hydrocarbon industry. Preliminary simulation studies have been performed for the production of natural gas from hydrate reservoirs through thermal injection, depressurization, and in-situ combustion. Apart from gas production modeling, few studies are available on the heat and mass-transfer rates accompanying hydrate dissociation. Kamath et al. and Kamath and Holder viewed heat transfer during hydrate dissociation as a nucleate boiling phenomenon, while Selim and Sloan viewed it as a moving-boundary ablation process. Experimental results acquired by Ullerich et al. on the dissociation of methane hydrates agreed well with predictions from the ablation model. The heat-transfer models presented by Kamath et al. and Selim and Sloan are useful in modeling pure hydrate dissociation processes. For gas hydrates in the earth's sediment, the heat and mass-transfer rates are strongly influenced by the surrounding sediment. In this paper, an analytical model that describes hydrate dissociation in sediment under thermal stimulation is presented. Results from the model are used to evaluate gas production from hydrate reservoirs by steam or hot-water thermal stimulation. Dissociation Model Consider a uniform distribution of hydrates in the porous medium in Fig. 1, which is initially at a uniform temperature Ti and occupies the semi-infinite region 0 less than x less than infinity. Initially, the hydrates are assumed to fill the entire porosity, phi, so that 1 - phi is the volume fraction of the sediment. At time t=0, the temperature at the boundary x=0 is raised to a new temperature, T0, that is higher than Ti and is held constant thereafter. Hydrate dissociation commences, and as a result, a moving interface that separates the water/gas region from the undissociated hydrate region exists at some distance x=chi(t). Thus, at any time t greater than 0, the water/gas phase [dissociated-hydrates zone (Zone I)] occupies the region 0 less than x less than chi(t), while the undissociated-hydrate zone (Zone II) occupies the region chi(t) less than x less than infinity. Once the hydrate-dissociation temperature is exceeded, the phase interface will move forward at a decreasing velocity. The interface velocity decreases because of the insulating effect of the increasing thickness of the dissociated zone and also because of the energy required to elevate the temperature of the matrix material and resulting gas and water. A sharp density change usually occurs in the pore-filling material across the phase interface. According to the law of mass conservation, the gas will be streaming or transpiring toward the accessible or heated surface. The surface heat flux is consumed in supplying energy (1) to heat the dissociated Zone I, (2) to heat the dissociated gas streaming toward the heated surface and the water resulting from the dissociation process, (3) to dissociate the hydrate at the moving interface, and (4) to heat the undissociated solid matrix. Consequently, the following temperature and pressure distributions develop in the system: (1) a temperature distribution TI(x,t) in Zone I with Td less than TI(x, t) less than T0; (2) a temperature distribution TII(x,t) in Zone II with Ti less than TII(x,t) less than Td; and (3) a pressure distribution p(x,t) for the hydrocarbon gas in Zone I with p0 less than p(x,t) less than pd. Here Td and pd represent the temperature and pressure at the dissociation front, assumed to be in thermodynamic equilibrium. Fig. 1 is a schematic of these distributions. The water resulting from the dissociation process is assumed to remain motionless and is retained within the pores of the dissociated zone. This assumption restricts the analysis to hydrate saturation values of about 0.3. For the sake of simplicity, we assume that the thermophysical properties of each phase are constant. We also neglect viscous dissipation, reversible work of compression, and inertial effects, and rule out the possibility of mutual or external energy transmission. With these restrictions, the differential mass, momentum, and energy balances describing the dissociation process may be written as (1) (2) (3) (4) (5) Eqs. 1 and 2 are the continuity equation and the momentum equation (Darcy's law) of the gas in the dissociated phase. Eqs. 3 and 4 are the energy balances for the dissociated and undissociated phases, respectively. Eq. 5 is the equation of state (EOS) of the gas, assuming ideal behavior; this may be easily modified through use of a more sophisticated EOS or compressibility factors. In the energy balance for the dissociated zone, it has been assumed that the transpiring gas always acquires the local temperature of the sediment--i.e., it reaches an equilibrium heat-transfer condition with the solid. In a similar investigation dealing with the mechanism of heat exchange in sweat-cooled porous materials, Weinbaum and Wheeler demonstrated that the local gas and solid temperatures are nearly indistinguishable throughout the porous structure. The boundary and initial conditions associated with the above equations are (6) (7) (8) (9) (10) SPERE P. 245^

AB  - Abstract New hydrate profile correlations for methane gas hydrates were obtained computationally (using three different hydrate prediction software packages) and experimentally (with three different MEG products from different suppliers). Methane gas with pure distilled water was the benchmark case used for the software comparison at pressures of 50 to 300 bar. In order to compare the hydrate inhibition performance of the MEG products, aqueous 10 wt% MEG solutions were tested using the isobaric method at a pressure range of 50 to 200 bar. Furthermore, the kinetics of MEG hydrate inhibition were studied experimentally for methane gas using a stirred cryogenic sapphire cell. Hydrate formation start, hydrate dissociation initiation and hydrate dissociation end points were identified and analysed. The results were correlated with the hydrate formation start points predicted by three well known selected hydrate prediction software packages (which all use the Peng-Robinson equation of state). Moreover, the hydrate inhibition performance of the three MEG products was evaluated to determine the superior MEG product that provides the best hydrate inhibition performance. Our analysis shows that the hydrate formation points predicted computationally are not identical to the hydrate formation start points measured in this work. Software "A" and software "B" predicted results matching with the average curve of the experimental hydrate formation start and hydrate dissociation start points, and with a deviation value of 0.06 °C for software "A" and a deviation value of 0.03 °C for software "B". However, software "C" predicted results almost identical with the experimental dissociation start points, and with an average deviation value of 0.54 °C. The methane gas hydrate profiles for the three different MEG products (X-MEG, Y-MEG and Z-MEG) indicated that X-MEG was the most efficient inhibitor as it shifted the hydrate curve most to the left; X-MEG shifted the hydrate formation curve by an average temperature of 2.07 °C when compared to the benchmark curve (100% water); while Z-MEG shifted the curve by an average temperature of 1.81 °C and Y-MEG shifted the curve by an average temperature of 1.71 °C. We conclude that not all software packages predict the same results although they are all based on the same equation of state. Furthermore not all MEG products supplied have the same hydrate inhibition efficiency. Importantly, choosing the best MEG supplier will reduce the OPEX by reducing the amount of MEG used, and it will accommodate more relaxed operating conditions of lower temperatures and higher pressures.

AB  - Abstract Gas hydrate is one of the major challenges facing production and transportation of natural gas from the remote regions of deep waters, ultra-deep waters and the arctic areas where large reserves have been discovered globally. Gas hydrate is grouped into three types; type I, II and H. Among the aforementioned types, type II is of interest to the oil and gas industry because this is the one that obstructs natural gas flow in production pipelines. In dissociating hydrate in a production pipeline, the following techniques are applied; thermal, chemical, depressurization and mechanical. However, depressurization technique is the most widely used in field of operations where absolute hydrate plugs in production pipelines are experienced. This method has been applied from time past with rule-of-thumb as there are limited models on hydrate dissociation. In this study, a mathematical model was developed based on cubic-degree polynomial using Fourier law. The developed model considered a radial dissociation from a two-sided approach on a fixed boundary which was finally programmed into software called PIPECLEAN using Visual Basic(as shown in Fig 7and 8)  and validated with published experimental data. Results show that dissociation commences from a temperature of 285.7K and above 13hours to dissociate a production flowline that is plugged off by gas hydrate. The study will aid depressurization operations in the field to predict hydrate dissociation real-time,the dissociating temperature to achieve this and the hydrate penetration depth inwardly from the walls of a pipeline. More importantly, the developed model will assist in curbing the problem of guesses when dissociating hydrate in field of operations. One limitation is that the model cannot determine gas evolved during dissociation. Introduction Exploration and production of natural gas is believed to be a function of market demand. Today, the market exist and the demands are improving globally but how to leverage these gas reserves from the stranded regions of deep waters, ultra-deep waters or arctic regions to the market is one of the challenges facing natural gas production.

AB  - ABSTRACT Cracks may be created in clays after gas hydrate dissociates. More cracks can be created in clays with a high degree of gas saturation after dissociation and the degree of gas saturation is linked to peak undrained shear strength of the clays through experimental tests. A damage model is proposed in this study to characterize strength reduction of clays after cracks are developed. NGI ADP model and damage model are implemented to Plaxis software. A variable distribution of gas hydrate was revealed in Shenhu area, in northern continental slope of the South China Sea. Geotechnical models for two critical slopes are proposed based on seismic profiles. Submarine slope stability is evaluated for these slopes in this area if gas hydrate is dissociated. The finite element analysis showed that safety factor is reduced by 6% to 13% after gas hydrate dissociation. INTRODUCTION Gas hydrate dissociation is often considered as a triggering factor for submarine slope failures occurring in relatively deep waters where the bulk of the gas hydrate is found in fine-grained sediments. Physical and mechanical properties of sediments with gas hydrate have been intensively studied in recent years (Soga, et al., 2006, Yun, 2007, Sultan and Garziglia, 2011, Zhang et al., 2017). It was concluded that strength of soil is increasing with increasing of hydrate saturation and confining pressure. However, there are relatively few studies that focus on the effect of gas hydrate dissociation on the geotechnical behavior of clays, and very few on how gas hydrate dissociation affects the undrained shear strength of clays with cracks caused by dissociation. Sample cracking due to gas hydrate dissociation was observed on the continental slope Keathley area, Gulf of Mexico (Fugro, 2006). Jin et al., (2015) studied crack extension induced by dissociation of fracturehosted methane gas hydrate. Lee et al., (2010) reported volume change associated with formation and dissociation of hydrate in sediment using miscible TetraHydroFuran (THF) as a hydrate, and the result indicated that large axial strains were caused due to dissociation by heating. Yang et al. (2010 and 2015) illustrated the effects of hydrate dissociation in clays from laboratory tests. The tests were combined with visualization including very-high-resolution CT scanning using R11 as the hydrate forming fluid in both laponite and Onsøy clay. The results showed that gas hydrate melting in clay leads to formation of gas bubbles; with increasing volume bubble shape changes to disk shape and fractures develop; continued release of gas leads to connection of fractures from different locations and formation of gas migration pathways. The study developed a mechanistic understanding on how cracks developed in clays due to hydrate dissociation.

AB  - ABSTRACT:Dissociation kinetics of gas hydrates has been investigated experimentally. The artificial natural gas hydrates were made from pure methane or methane-ethane mixed gas, and then its composition and the structure were examined. These samples were dissociated under various conditions. Obtained dissociation rates were discussed with analytical model. As a result, it seemed that generated gas by hydrate dissociation affects heat flux and changes dissociation rate. Especially in case of methane-ethane mixed gas hydrate, generated gas seemed to affect thermal stability by changing environmental gas composition. In “drilling mud fluid”, the dissociation rate have almost proportional relation with the “mud” concentrationINTRODUCTIONNatural gas hydrates existing under sea ground have been widely known as a large natural gas reservoir, and then expected to be a future energy resource (Okuda, 1993). In order to recover natural gas from them commercially, in-situ dissociation of hydrate under sea ground is needed (Ji-Ahmadi and Smith, 2001). Therefore the dissociation rate, which depends on T-P condition and other environmental conditions, are essential parameter to evaluate gas recovery from hydrate layer. Like methane hydrate (C1 In this study dissociation rates of C1 Hyd and C1-C2 Hyd are determined at a variety of experimental conditions. Both of C1 Hyd and C1-C2 Hyd are synthesized by an ice-gas interface method. Raman spectrometry and gas chromatograph are used to examine the structure and composition of C1-C2 Hyd, respectively. Hyd), a considerable amount of methane-ethane mixed hydrate (C1-C2 Hyd), which contains methane and ethane molecules as guests, is also found in ocean deposits. When comparing with comparing with C1 Hyd, C1-C2 Hyd can be considered to be more stable (Sloan and Fleyfel, 1992). However, there have been a few information on the dissociation kinetics and dynamic behavior under practical condition is not well understood.

AB  - Abstract Methane hydrate is a promising energy resource in the near future. One of the processes of its development in the sub-seabed sediments is depressurisation: pumping-up water through a well depressurises down to the extent lower than the equilibrium, and hydrate dissociates. However, hydrate dissociation is endothermic and temperature may become lower than the equilibrium point near a well and, hence, hydrate reforms. This may cause blockage of gas-water flow in the sediment. In this study, heat and mass transfer in water-gas-sand three-phases was analysed numerically by modelling them using a threedimensional lattice Boltzmann method. Sand grains were assumed to be spherical for simplicity and the dissolution of methane into water through the interface was also analysed. At the same time, volumetric rate of hydrate formation was obtained by comparing the model results with those of measurement. Introduction Methane hydrate is an ice-like crystal that consists of water as host cage and gas as guest molecules, and exists widely in the sub-seabed sediments and in the permafrost layer, which are under low temperature and high pressure. It is confirmed that methane hydrate contains methane more than that in the form of gas on the earth and has been paid attention as a new energy resource in recent years. To predict the technical and economical feasibilities of its production process, numerical simulations are necessary. One of the processes of its development in the sub-seabed sediments is depressurisation: pumping-up water through a well depressurises down to the extent lower than the equilibrium, and hydrate dissociates. However, hydrate dissociation is endothermic and temperature may become lower than the equilibrium point near a well and, hence, hydrate reforms. This may cause blockage of gas-water flow in the sediment. Therefore, formation of gas hydrate in the sediment should be understood and modelled numerically for the design of its production system. For modelling hydrate formation, its rate is particularly important. Therefore, it is necessary to estimate the formation of hydrate and the consequent reduction of permeability accurately to predict the production rate of methane gas. In this study, a small high-pressure cell was filled with fine glass beads, methane gas, and small amount of water, and gas hydrate is formed in it by increasing pressure. The same was simulated by a numerical model. As a result, by comparing the both results, a hydrate formation rate was extracted.

AB  - ABSTRACTGas hydrates, which are naturally occurring ice-like combinations of gas and water, have the potential to provide vast amounts of natural gas from the world’s oceans and polar regions. However, producing gas economically from hydrates entails major technical challenges. Proposed recovery methods such as dissociating or melting gas hydrates by heating or depressurization are currently being tested. One such test was con ducted in northern Canada by the partners in the Mallik 2002 Gas Hydrate Production Research Well Program.This paper describes how resistivity logs were used to determine the size of the annular region of gas hydrate dissociation that occurred around the wellbore during the thermal test in the Mallik 5L-38 well. An open-hole logging suite, run prior to the thermal test, included array induction, array laterolog, nuclear magnetic resonance and 1.1-GHz electromagnetic propagation logs. The reservoir saturation tool was run both before and after the thermal test to monitor formation changes. A cased-hole formation resistivity log was run after the test.Baseline resistivity values in each formation layer (Rt) were established from the deep laterolog data. The resistivity in the region of gas hydrate dissociation near the wellbore (Rxo) was determined from electro magnetic propagation and reservoir saturation tool measurements. The radius of hydrate dissociation as a function of depth was then determined by means of iterative for ward modeling of cased-hole formation resistivity tool response. The solution was obtained by varying the modeled dissociation radius until the modeled log over laid the field log.Pretest gas hydrate production computer simulations had predicted that dissociation would take place at a uniform radius over the 13-ft test inter val. However, the post-test resistivity modeling showed that this was not the case. The resistivity-derived dissociation radius was greatest near the out let of the pipe that circulated hot water in the wellbore, where the highest temperatures were recorded. The radius was smallest near the center of the test interval, where a conglomerate section with low values of porosity and permeability inhibited dissociation. The free gas volume calculated from the resistivity-derived dissociation radii yielded a value within 20 per cent of surface gauge measurements. These results show that the inversion of resistivity measurements holds promise for use in future gas hydrate monitoring.INTRODUCTIONGas hydrates are known to be wide spread in per ma frost regions and in seabed sediments of outer continental margins. The amount of natural gas contained in the world’s gas hydrate accumulations is enormous, but estimates are speculative and range over several orders of magnitude. Despite the wide range in gas hydrate volumetric estimates, even the lowest estimates indicate that gas hydrates are a much greater resource of natural gas than conventional accumulations. However, it is important to note that none of these assessments has predicted how much gas could actually be produced.Gas recovery from hydrates is hindered because the gas is in a solid form (Figure 1), and hydrates commonly occur in hostile Arctic and deep marine environments.

AB  - ABSTRACTA series of experiments were carried out to study CO2 hydrate formation and dissociation in porous medium using Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI). A new vessel was used to satisfy the demands of high pressure and no influence on the magnetic signal in the experiments. Images were obtained by using a fast spin-echo sequence, and field of view was set to 40×40×40 mm. The vessel pressure was recorded during CO2 hydrate formation and dissociation, which was used to compare to MRI data. The results indicated that the MRI data could visualize hydrate formation and dissociation, and the MRI data was good agreement with the pressure change. The CO2 hydrate formation rate was also quantified using MRI data. INTRODUCTIONThe explosive growth of fossil fuels consumption has caused global problems, including air toxics and greenhouse gases (GHG). Carbon dioxide (CO2) is the largest contributor in regard of its amount present in the atmosphere contributing to 60 percent of global warming effects (Yang, Xu, Fan, Gupta, Slimane, Bland, and Wright, 2008). So sequestration of CO2 has become an important issue, and scientists are exploring the option of sequestering CO2 in the deep ocean (Servio and Englezos, 2001). Since the pressure and temperature conditions in ocean and in marine sediment may well be within the CO2 hydrate stability zone (Kvamme, Graue, Buanes, Kuznetsova and Ersland, 2007), the CO2 can be sequestrated in hydrate form. In order to obtain high quality data, the formation and dissociation of CO2 hydrate in these instances have been widely studied. MRI is an effective tool for investigations in physical, chemical, life, and clinical sciences as it non-invasively maps the water proton with high-space resolution in three-dimensions. Since its perfect performance for proton, MRI has been used for hydrate investigation.

AB  - The world-first offshore production test of gas hydrate was just performed in the deep water Nankai Trough along the Pacific coast of Japan in March, 2013. A week-long flow test successfully produced methane gas by depressurizing method from the subsea methane hydrate reservoir. While methane gas was successfully extracted from hydrate, there is a strong urge for understanding the dissociation behavior and characterizing production process of hydrate through the depressurization method. This is a crucial knowledge for the future commercial production of gas hydrate. The dissociation of methane hydrate is an endothermic reaction, and the drop of formation temperature is expected to occur as the dissociation progresses. By capturing the phenomenon of temperature decrease in-situ, the data attributed to the dissociation of methane hydrate can be obtained during production. Two monitoring wells, uniquely designed for minimizing thermal disturbance and better thermal coupling were drilled in the vicinity of the production well, and the two types of temperature sensors using DTS (Distributed Temperature Sensing) and array-type RTD (Resistance Temperature Detector) were deployed in the monitoring wells and recorded the data not only during the flow test period but also before and after the test. DTS covered the entire wellbore interval while the array-type RTD sensors were strategically placed across the gas hydrate reservoir with higher temperature resolution and accuracy. In both monitoring wells, the temperature decreases were observed distinctively with both sensors as the flow test progressed over a week. The data quality check confirmed both measurements were conformable to the design specification and demonstrated the strong advantages of having both sensors in this monitoring system for further interpretation to investigate the dissociation behaviors. The framework for temperature data analysis was defined to perform thermal characterization of gas hydrate reservoir during the production test stage. The preliminary analysis integrated with well-logs and production data was performed, and the results that could explain not only the dissociation behaviors but various other events during the production test were obtained.

AB  - ABSTRACT:Dissociation behavior of methane gas hydrate in ethylene glycol and silicone oil was investigated experimentally. Pellet shaped hydrate samples were prepared using artificial fine methane hydrate powder. These pellets were soaked in ethylene glycol or silicone oil in highpressure optical vessel, and dissociation reaction was induced by depressurizing the system pressure. The dissociation rates were measured under several isothermal-isobaric conditions, and the reaction surface was directly observed. Obtained dissociation rates were discussed with mathematical model that is based on one-dimensional thermal conductivity. From these approaches some characteristic aspects of dissociation behavior of methane hydrate in ethylene glycol and silicone oil is discussed. INTRODUCTIONNatural gas hydrate is crystalline compounds that can contain large amount of natural gas in it. Some ocean transportation or storage systems of natural gas using gas hydrate are investigated. In these systems it is advantageous that gas hydrate is treated as slurry medium. Therefore, gas hydrate is prospected to soak in cooling medium or viscous fluid. It is also advantageous that such fluids have functions of preventing or promoting the dissociation reaction of gas hydrate to control the dissociation rate. Therefore, the dissociation behavior of gas hydrate in such fluid is required basic data. In this study, dissociation behavior of methane gas hydrate in ethylene glycol and silicone oil was investigated experimentally. Pure methane hydrate powder was synthesized from ice and pure methane gas using “ Ice-Gas Interface Method”. With these powders, pellet shaped hydrate samples were prepared. These pellets were soaked in ethylene glycol or silicone oil in high-pressure optical vessel, and dissociation reaction was induced by depressurizing the system pressure. The dissociation rates were measured under several isothermal-isobaric conditions, and the reaction surface was directly observed. Obtained dissociation rates were discussed with mathematical model that is based on one-dimensional thermal conduction.

AB  - ABSTRACT The dissociation behavior of a laboratory-made methane hydrate core sample following injection of an inhibitor (aqueous methanol solution) has been investigated using a specially developed experimental setup. The core holder utilized in this work is 5 times greater in length than the one previously employed. A warm aqueous methanol solution was injected into core samples, which simulate natural gas hydrate sediment under the seafloor. Core temperature decreased upon injection of the inhibitor, in contrast to the case of pure water injection. Measurement of gas yields versus time suggests that the inhibitor increased dissociation rates. The observed pressure differentials between inlet and outlet of the core sample suggest that the inhibitor effectively prevented the reformation of hydrate within the dissociating core sample. INTRODUCTION Natural gas hydrates are crystalline compounds that can contain large amounts of natural gas (Sloan, 1998). Owing to recent seismic exploration and geological research, it is widely known that natural gas hydrate exists in geological formations (mainly unconsolidated sediment) and constitutes a potentially large natural gas resource for the future (Makogon, 1981; Brooks et al., 1986; Kvenvolden, 1988; Kvenvolden et al., 1993; Okuda, 1993; Gornitz and Fung, 1994; Sassen, 2001). To make recovery of natural gas from hydrates commercially viable, hydrates must be dissociated in situ. The inhibitor injection method is thought to be an effective method for forcing gas hydrate dissociation, apart from depressurization and thermal stimulation. While there is only limited information about dissociation kinetics in the presence of hydrate inhibitors, substantial phase equilibrium data are available (Davidson et al., 1981; Ng and Robinson, 1985; Robinson and Ng, 1986). In our previous study, an experimental setup featuring a small core holder was successfully used to investigate the dissociation behavior of a methane hydrate (MH) core sample under simulated sub-seafloor conditions.

AB  - ABSTRACT:Surface area of methane hydrate in sediments is necessary to predict the amount of dissociated methane gas. It depends on the morphology how methane hydrate exists in sediments under the ground. The purpose of this study is to obtain a model equation for the surface area of methane hydrate in sediments as a function of porosity, hydrate saturation, and size of sediment particles. We conducted hydrate dissociation experiment in a pressure cell filled by glass beads. It is expected that the temperature in the cell first goes down to the equilibrium point due to hydrate dissociation, and that the dissociation ceases until heat is transferred from the surrounding cell walls. We simulated this process by using a numerical model with tentative surface areas. The surface area is, then, estimated by comparing the amounts of dissociated gas in the experiments and in the numerical simulations. INTRODUCTIONThe surface area of the methane hydrate existing in sediments is necessary to estimate the dissociation rate, together with the dissociation speed of methane hydrate. The latter was given in a function of molecular fraction of methane, temperature and pressure by part of the authors. The surface area depends on the morphology how methane hydrate exists in sediments under the ground. In this study, it is assumed that the area is a function of the size of sediment particles, porosity, and hydrate saturation. We first conducted hydrate dissociation experiment by using a pressure cell filled by glass beads. To control the porosity, we mixed the beads with a couple of diameters. Water was filled in the cell and hydrate was generated. The amount of the water determines the hydrate saturation. It is expected that the temperature in the experimental cell first goes down to the equilibrium point due to the hydrate dissociation.

AB  - Abstract Large amounts of gas hydrates are deposited in marine sediments and permafrost regions in many parts of the world. Their potential as a future energy source, but also as a geohazard and contributor to global warming has raised people's interest. The paper reviews the major methane hydrate test facilities and summarises their capabilities. It is reckoned that none of them can dissociate hydrates locally by a combination of heating and depressurizing while measuring their composition changes in it situ. These features are later revealed as the core elements of the new hydrate test facility at the National University of Singapore (NUS), which can simulate hydrates in up to 1500 m below sea water level and 350 m below sea bed or surface, dissociating them along a centred line source while measuring local pore pressure-, temperature- and density- changes. Its single components are described in detail. Introduction Natural gas hydrate is a crystalline solid composed of water and gas. It is stable at low temperature and high pressure, and has been found in permafrost regions and marine sediments in most parts of the world (Kvenvolden, 1993). Under stable hydrate conditions (upper left side in Figure 1), gas molecules are trapped within cages of water molecules. These cages are supported by stronger bonds between the hydrogen molecules and weaker van der Waals attraction forces between the host- and guest molecules. Like in conventional gas reservoirs, the vast majority of the compounding gas in natural hydrates is methane. Gas hydrates were first discovered in 1778 (Bennewitz, 1928). When Hammerschmidt (1934) proved that flow limitations and blockages of gas pipelines were caused by hydrates of the carrying gas itself, the interest in gas hydrates gained a considerable boost throughout the petroleum industry. Naturally occurring gas hydrates were discovered in 1968, when by coincidence a dissociating hydrate layer fed the produced Messoyakha gas field in western Siberia (Collett, 1993). Controversy arises in the global quantification of the potential methane preserved in form of hydrates. The most recent estimates vary between 2.5 x 1015 m3 under standard conditions (scm) (Milkov, 2004) and 1.2 x 1018 scm (Klauda and Sandler, 2005). Kvenvolden (1993, 1988) pointed out that more than twice as much organic carbon is being stored in hydrates (53% or ~21 x 1015 scm) as it is in conventional fossil fuel reserves at present (27%), and this is widely accepted. In the past century, natural gas hydrates have done neither much harm nor any good as an energy resource. At present methane hydrates are considered both an opportunity as a future energy source but also as a threat to the environment. About 8200 years ago, hydrate dissociation has been argued to be a major contributor to the Storegga landslide offshore Norway, causing devastating floods in Norway and northern Great Britain (Mienert et al., 2005). Such or similar events are clearly not confined to the past; slope instabilities as well as borehole failures initiated by hydrate dissociation are ever since subjects of much concern (Briaud and Chaouch, 1999, Nixon and Grozic, 2007). Uncontrolled dissociation of methane hydrates could also have impact on the global climate change (Archer et al., 2008). Given the fact that methane is a 20 to 40 times more potent greenhouse gas than carbon-dioxide, its role can certainly not be neglected. A profound understanding of the dissociation process is hence required to better comprehend its potential effects.

AB  - Gas hydrates reservoirs are a type of unconventional reservoir that is an extremely abundant and ubiquitous source of energy. They are also relatively cleaner than most other hydrocarbon sources which makes them an even more attractive source of energy. The potential of this source of energy has, however, not been utilized since very little production has ever taken place from these reservoirs due to their complexity. This research provides an understanding of gas hydrates thermodynamics and reservoir properties in order to assist in properly modelling the hydrate flow in porous media. The research also provides a road map to the current production methods that have been used in pilot tests in order to produce from gas hydrates reservoirs. The production methods explained include depressurization, thermal stimulation, inhibitor injection, combined methods, carbon dioxide injection, and mining. The mechanism of each method is fully explained, and the advantages and disadvantages of each method are also explained. Several case studies worldwide are also discussed to show how each production method has been used to produce from the gas hydrate reservoirs. The results from the case studies are also used to reach conclusions on how each method can be improved upon. To the author's knowledge, no publication has provided a complete overview on gas hydrates and their production mechanism which makes this research a crucial step in providing an overview on many aspects of gas hydrates reservoirs and their production mechanisms and potential. Understanding the mechanisms to produce from gas hydrate reservoirs is a crucial step in the hydrocarbon industry to allow us to tap into this vast source of energy in the near future.

AB  - Abstract: In the permafrost region and ocean bottom where gas hydrates are formed in the form of nodules mound etc, it mixes up with the clay and other substances at subsea soil. Naturally its property gets changed during formation as well as dissociation. Therefore the present study aims at studying the effect of extraneous material like Bentonite with different composition and surfactant on formation and dissociation of gas hydrates. Extensive observation of pressure temperature equilibrium during formation and decomposition of methane hydrate under different conditions have been made. The effect of bentonite and anionic surfactant sodium dodecyl sulphate (SDS) on the rate of hydrate formation is thoroughly investigated in this work. Three different concentrations (3%, 5%, and 10%) of bentonite are tested followed by three different concentration of SDS (300 ppm, 500 ppm, 1000 ppm) in unique concentration of 5% bentonite. For comparison purpose, the formation and dissociation of pure water has been also conducted. All the experiments are started with same pressure i.e. 440.2 psi. It has been found that addition of Bentonite inhibit the hydrate formation as compared to water, however SDS speed up the hydrate formation effectively. Keywords: Gas hydrate, Bentonite, Sodium Dodecyl Sulphate (SDS), and Methane. 1. Introduction Gas hydrates are solid crystalline non-stoichiometric compounds called clathrates in which gas molecules are trapped within the crystalline structure of water molecules. Such compounds resembling ice or snow are formed when some light gases, such as the components of natural gas come into contact with water under particular condition of temperature and pressure. In generalized form it can be expressed for the gas G as: G (g) +YH2O=G.YH2O(s); where Y is the hydration number, which is a function of type of gas molecule and the structure of hydrate it forms. The stability of hydrate is dependent on the pressure, temperature and the composition of hydrate bearing zone. Understanding the formation dissociation behavior of gas hydrates in sediments is important for seafloor platform and well stability. These sediments contain sands, silts, and clays, and the sediment composition and texture may affect gas hydrate stability. Smaller pores typically inhibit hydrate formation (enhance dissociation) more than large pores, however pore spaces in some minerals may enhance hydrate formation under certain conditions. Most minerals studied do not directly affect stability, with the exception of some swelling clays, which under some conditions may enhance stability. For any assessment of natural gas hydrates in hydrates in hydrate-bearing sediments, the determination of microstructure, composition and physical properties, as well as of the underlying formation and possible decomposition processes is essential.

AB  - AbstractParameters affecting gas hydrate formation include temperature, pore pressure, gas chemistry, and pore-water salinity. Any change in the equilibrium of these parameters may result in dissociation (gas-hydrate turns into free gas/water mixture) and/or dissolution (gas-hydrate becomes mixture of water and dissolved gas) of the gas hydrate. While, gas-hydrate dissociation at the base of the Gas Hydrate Occurrence Zone (GHOZ) is often considered as a major cause of sediment deformation and submarine slope failures the consequence in terms of pore pressure and sediment deformation of the dissolution of the gas hydrate at the top of the GHOZ remains neglected. In this study, we quantify and compare the excess pore pressure resulting from gas hydrate dissociation and dissolution. Based on theoretical development it is demonstrated that excess pore pressure and shear discontinuities generated by hydrate dissociation is unlikely to be a hazardous factor. In natural environment, the excess pore pressure generated by hydrate dissociation is bounded by the gas hydrate stability law inducing for a natural temperature increase a limited amount of excess pore pressure and limited shear discontinuities at the base of the GHOZ. On the other hand, we show that under natural temperature changes hydrate dissolution at the top of the gas hydrate stability zone, which can occur at a regional scale, is a hazardous process that can lead to catastrophic landslides. IntroductionFor the last 3 decades, several authors have raised serious concerns regarding the possible link between gas hydrate and submarine slope failures. McIver1 was amongst the first authors to speculate about this possible link. In the McIver conceptual model1, the excess pore pressure generated by hydrate dissociation and the sediment shear strength decreases (lost of hydrate playing the role of cementing agent between sediment grains) are the two key factors in the slope failure mechanism. The causal factor of the hydrate dissociation in McIver1 model is the continuous sedimentation, which induces the upward migration of the base of the Gas Hydrate Stability Zone (GHSZ). Afterwards, Kvenvolden2 has stated that an upward movement of the bottom of the GHSZ due to an increase of bottom water temperature may accelerate the process of slope failures associated to hydrate dissociation. Different authors have later developed several other hypotheses and theories supposing all that gas hydrate dissociation may lead to important excess pore pressure and lead to sediment deformations and slope instabilities3,4,5,6,7. In the meantime, many large submarine landslides have been described worldwide in areas where gas hydrate occurrence was proved or suspected9,10,11,12,13. Paull and co-authors6 have proposed that gas-hydrate is the main cause of the increased frequency of sea-floor slumping on continental margins containing gas hydrates during sea-level lowstands. While authors seem to agree about the association between gashydrate dissociation and submarine slope failures, few theoretical and mathematical works were developed to define accurately the mechanism associated to the slope failure process.

AB  - AbstractHydrates are crystalline structures that are formed under conditions of low temperatures or high pressures and consist of a lattice made up of hydrogen-bonded water molecules, containing cavities. These cavities can be stabilized by van der Waals forces if occupied by certain types of guest molecules (e.g. CH4). Hydrates are very important compounds due to their capacity to store large volumes of gases. They are studied as a possible source of energy, since an enormous reservoir of carbon is deposited in worldwide accumulations of hydrates, containing predominantly methane, both on-shore (under the permafrost), and off-shore (in marine sediments).In this study, a 2-D pore-network simulation based on concepts from Invasion Percolation in a Gradient is discussed to study the dissociation of methane hydrate in porous media. By using reported experimental values of porosity and permeability that are found in oceanic sediments we reconstruct a porous medium with similar properties by varying appropriately the size range of throat radii and the ratio pore/throat radii. The reconstructed porous medium can be either fully or partially saturated with hydrate. In this work emphasis is placed on examining the patterns formed by the release of methane gas in a partially saturated porous medium following hydrate dissociation. We investigate how the various patterns are affected by parameters such as the viscous pressure drop applied to the system, the size range of throat radii, hydrate saturation, and pore size distribution. Note that in order for the methane gas to be produced from the system, the critical gas saturation (defined as the volume fraction of the gas phase at the onset of bulk gas flow) must be reached. This is an issue of significant importance that delineates the possible range of parameters where methane production can be economically viable. For the critical gas saturation to occur the produced gas clusters must: either (i) connect to each other forming a sample-spanning gas cluster through which the gas phase can be produced, or (ii) be mobilized by the presence of viscous or buoyancy forces and thus arrive at the producing end of the network (this is a limiting case where continuum models may break down because of the formation and mobilization of gas bubbles). In order to obtain a better understanding of the production efficiency for the commercial development of hydrate deposits we address the significant question whether the resulting dissociating system (at lower hydrate saturation values) is below or above the critical gas saturation and how the aforementioned parameters affect the value of the critical gas saturation.IntroductionUnder conditions of low temperatures or high pressures, both above and below the freezing point of water, a crystalline structure (known as clathrate hydrate) can be formed that involves a lattice made up of hydrogen-bonded water molecules, containing cavities. The lattice can be stabilized by van der Waals forces, through the occupation of specific cavities within the lattice by certain types of guest molecules (Wilder et al.1). While over 100 different guest molecules are known to form clathrate hydrates (Englezos2), of interest to this work is the case of methane.Interest in clathrate hydrates arises from their capacity to store large volumes of gas. The amount of methane gas stored in a given volume of hydrate is about 180 times higher than when the gas is at standard conditions (Sloan3). Worldwide accumulations of hydrates, containing predominantly methane, both on-shore (under the permafrost), and off-shore (in marine sediments), amount to an enormous reservoir of carbon and represent a large potential source of a clean fuel (Buffet4). Moderate estimates of the amount of methane entrapped in hydrates are of the order of 21×1015m3 (Kvenvolden5), however, these amounts are still debated in the literature. Provided these estimates are correct, a vast amount of carbon is stored in gas hydrates, larger by a factor 2, than the carbon present in all known fossil fuels combined together (Kvenvolden6). The study of clathrate hydrates has also attracted the attention of the petroleum industry since formation of clathrate hydrates can be observed during the transport of oil in arctic regions, resulting in blockage of production wells and pipelines, thus adding a significant economic impact on production (Koh et al.7).

AB  - Summary On the basis of the wellbore and reservoir heat-transfer process during deepwater drilling, a heat-transfer model between wellbore and formation is built up for two different conditions: without riser and with riser. Wellbore and formation temperature distributions under different drilling-fluid-injection temperatures, flow rates, circulating times, and drilling depths are simulated by use of this model. Taking the hydrate-phase equilibrium into consideration, a possible region of hydrate-formation dissociation is analyzed, and effective methods are proposed to control the hydrate dissociation. The results indicate that, during shallow formation drilling, the increase of drilling-fluid flow rate will cause the wellbore temperature to rise, but below the hydrate-dissociation temperature in the whole process; during deep-formation drilling, drilling fluid is heated, and the heat is transferred from the deeper formation to the shallower formation through fluid circulation. Thus, the hydrate-reservoir temperature increases gradually along the wellbore radial direction. Hydrates will dissociate after the hydrate equilibrium temperature is reached; this may cause wellbore collapse or methane leak from the reservoir and result in disaster. To control hydrate dissociation during deepwater drilling, attention should be paid to the period of deep-formation drilling. Sensitivity studies indicate that the risk of hydrate dissociation rises as the drilling-fluid-injection temperature, flow rate, and circulating time increase.

AB  - ABSTRACT:Formation / dissociation behavior of clathrate hydrate in bentonite or kaolin suspension with or without sodium chloride was experimentally investigated for safe gas production from the natural gas hydrate reservoir. Raman spectroscopic analysis is conducted to investigate the property of formed hydrate from bentonite or kaolin suspension. Vapor pressures of water of these suspensions, which are related to hydrate equilibrium conditions, are also determined. The crystal structures of clathrate hydrates formed from clay suspensions can be determined as sI. However, the small cavity occupancies of hydrate formed from calcium bentonite and kaolin are 0.792 and 0.794 respectively, which are approximately 10 % smaller than that of pure MH or hydrate formed from sodium bentonite. Obtained vapor pressure suggests that equilibrium T-P condition in clay suspension without NaCl does not shift within the concentration region of 1 to 10 wt%. However, for NaCl 20 wt% - sodium bentonite 10 wt% suspension and NaCl 20 wt% - calcium bentonite 10 wt% suspension, the vapor pressures are rather smaller than that of NaCl 20 wt% solution. It suggests the equilibrium pressures in these suspensions become high compared to that in NaCl 20 wt% solution. INTRODUCTIONNatural gas hydrates are crystalline compounds that can contain a large amount of natural gas (Sloan and Koh, 2008). Owing to recent seismic exploration and geological research, it is widely known that natural gas hydrate that exists in the sediment constitutes a large natural gas resource and is expected to be an energy source in the future (Makogon, 1981; Brooks et al., 1986; Kvenvolden, 1988; Kvenvolden et al., 1993; Okuda, 1993; Gornitz and Fung, 1994; Sassen, 2001; Fujii, 2008). Natural gas hydrate will be dissociated mainly by the depressurization in the geological formation for commercial gas recovery. Fig. 1 shows an example of gas production scheme.

AB  - Abstract Well integrity during hydrocarbon production from an oil or gas well drilled through naturally occurring gas hydrate bearing sediments (HBS) may be problematic due to hydrate dissociation during well production. Assessment of well casing integrity is complicated because of the many variables involved such as: (1) character, distribution and volumetric concentration of gas hydrate habitat; (2) physical characteristics, in-situ stress-strain history along with thermal and engineering properties of the sediments overlying, within and vertically adjacent to hydrate bearing zones; (3) specific design and installation details of the production well(s) including well tubular depths, sizes and the undisturbed formation temperatures; (4) thermal characteristics of the various well components including tubing, casing, packer fluids, cement, and (5) details of produced hydrocarbons including production flowrates over time, reservoir pressures over time, duration of production, produced fluid composition over time and well temperature profile during production. In this paper, assessing well integrity using numerical modeling of wellbore stability in a natural deepwater offshore environment in the face of in-situ gas hydrate dissociation due to heating is performed and described in detail herein. The simulation includes thermodynamic stability analyses of the hydrates, assessment of fracture development and soil movement prediction considering seepage and soil consolidation effects followed by soil-well interaction modeling to determine potential stresses in the well components. Fracture models of crack dimensions are premised on either (1) development of a pattern of laterally expanding horizontal fractures evenly spaced vertically throughout the hydrate-bearing zone and centered on the wells, or (2) development of vertical fractures which will intersect the seafloor to allow gasses from hydrate dissociation to vent into water column. For this study, hydrate accumulation (character, saturation and distribution) for field development area is interpreted using seismic inversion and rock physics transform along with available geophysics seismic data and offset well log data. Sensitivity analyses with parametric variations of sediments and wells indicate that well design (in terms of insulation) and an increase in soil capacity for fluid flux will have a distinct impact on reduction of soil motions and casing stresses. With computational efficiency, the numerical simulation can provide bounding estimate of gas hydrate dissociation effects around producing wells. The model is very useful for a sound understanding of key parameters that determine HBS response to hydrocarbon production and the well integrity.

AB  - Electrically Traced Heated Pipe in Pipe (ETH-PiP) technology has been developed to overcome some of the challenges associated with deeper and more remote offshore oil and gas production. This active heating technology applies power to achieve a production fluid temperature above the wax or hydrate appearance temperature either continuously, during normal production, or intermittently, during shutdown periods. Concerning hydrate management, the contractor Company in collaboration with Major Operators conducting experimental and modelling studies to investigate hydrate dissociation in heated flowlines through a Joint Industry Project (JIP) kicked-off in 2012. The main objective of these investigations is to demonstrate that a long, non-permeable hydrate plug can be dissociated in a safe and controlled manner with the ETH-PiP technology. Large hydrate plugs (approximately 200 kg each) are formed in an 18m ETH-PiP 6? OD prototype, using a water and gas system equipped with DTS fiber optics systems for temperature monitoring, pressure and temperature sensors, and high accuracy gas flow meters. Different heating strategies are tested to investigate the best active heating procedure for safe hydrate plug dissociation, using temperature, pressure and released gas flow rate monitoring along the entire length of the prototype. Hydrate plug dissociations are performed in open or closed volumes for various conditions during the 2nd phase of the experimental campaign, which started at the end of 2013. High pressure differentials are applied across the hydrate plugs; non-uniform longitudinal heating profiles are applied to reproduce operating conditions similar to direct electrical heating; and three-phase dissociation experiments are conducted to simulate the influence of oil present in the hydrate pores on the plug dissociation. The paper gives an overview of the experimental set-up and measuring techniques used. It describes the hydrate plug formation, location, and characterization, as well as the successful dissociation of hydrate plugs. Preliminary simulation results based on a specifically developed "in-house" simulator are presented, as well as extrapolation of the results to real subsea conditions. This test program demonstrated that large non-permeable hydrate blockages in single line field architectures could be dissociated without local pressure build-up or plug run-away using ETH-PiP technology.

AB  - Abstract In this work, we concentrated on hydrate dissociation by the method of depressurization (two-sided and one-sided). Experiments focused on formation of hydrate plugs and subsequently their dissociation by both the methods to develop a database. The experiments lead to broadening our limited knowledge on hydrate dissociation by depressurization. The work was conducted with both structure I/structure II type of hydrates. The mechanism of hydrate dissociation (radial or axial) was studied in this work. Work on hydrate dissociation modeling is very limited. Peters (1999) had modeled the two-sided hydrate dissociation as a radial moving boundary model. The model is capable of predicting the hydrate dissociation time and the total time for plug melting. A one-sided depressurization model was developed that predicts the time to re-start the flow. The re-start time depends on the downstream pressure, length, porosity and permeability of the hydrate plug. A safety model was developed that assesses the hydrate plug movement when subjected to pressure gradients. The safety model provides the user a safety optimum downstream pressure for one-sided depressurization. The one-sided model was verified with laboratory and Tommeliten field plugs. The model predicted that the Tommeliten field plugs were re-started when the annulus spacing was 8% of pipeline radius. The safety model compared to the simulations of Xiao et al. (1998), and predicted higher, but comparable plug velocities. As a result of this work, operators should be able to Conduct one-sided depressurization safely Predict time when flow can be re-started A user-friendly Visual Basic front-end program (CSMPLUG) was developed that incorporates one-sided depressurization, two-sided depressurization and safety simulator. Experiments The purpose of the experiment was to form hydrates from ice and to dissociate the hydrate plug. The experiments were conducted in an unstirred batch reactor under isobaric and isothermal conditions. The formation experiments were conducted under variable temperature and pressure. Experimental conditions were limited to pressures between 0 and 3000 psig and temperatures between -10C and 5C. Experimental Equipment In the present work, a new long cell was built in order to study effects of length/diameter on plug dissociation times. Figure 1.1 shows the schematic of the long cell. The stainless steel cell is 0.92 m long, has an internal diameter of 0.0254 m and an internal volume of 0.00047 m3. The new long cell had a threaded end caps sealed by a rocket seal?. Figure 1.1: Schematic of the Long Cell (not to scale) (AVAILABLE IN FULL PAPER)All other parts of the apparatus (Figure 1.2) were connected with 0.006 m stainless steel tubing connected with Swagelock fittings. An Omega/Ashcroft pressure transducer, with a pressure range between 0 and 5000 psig, was used to continuously monitor the pressure in the cell. The accuracy of pressure transducer was + 25 psig. The temperature inside the cell was determined with the use of five type T (Copper-Constantan) thermocouples. The location and numbers of the thermocouples is also detailed in Figure 1.1. The temperature of the gas just outside each end of the cell was also measured using type T thermocouples. The temperature of the bath was monitored using a platinum resistance temperature detector (RTD).

AB  - A mathematical model is developed to simulate the hydrate dissociation by depressurization in hydrate-bearing porous media. It can interpret the effects of flows of multiphase fluids, the kinetic and endothermic processes, ice-water phase equilibrium, convection and conduction on the hydrate dissociation. The numerical results agree well with experiment conducted for the validation of numerical model. The model is used to analyze the gas production from free gas zone below hydrate reservoir by depressurization. The results show that the depressurization of overlying hydrate zone can provide continuous supply of gas to improve the output of production well and evidently prolong the lifespan of gas reservoir. INTRODUCTIONGas hydrates are ice-like crystalline compounds in which gas molecules are encaged inside voids in a hydrogen-bounded lattice structure of water molecules under suitable conditions of low temperature and high pressure. The conservative estimate of the total quantity of gas in hydrate is two times the energy contents of the total fuel fossil reserves recoverable by conventional methods (Burshears 1986). The coring of gas hydrate in South China Sea has confirmed the existence of hydrate in that ocean area. The present estimate quantity of natural gas in hydrate in South China Sea is about 60-70 billion tons (Wu et al. 2008). The hydrate reservoir underlain by a gas zone may be the most promising to be exploited when gas producing from the gas zone. The Messoyakha gas field in Siberia is regarded as this kind of hydrate accumulation, in which about 36% gas production is believed to come from hydrates dissociation. Some field experiments in Prudhoe bay/Kuparuk river area of United States and Mallik oil field of Canada have confirmed the existence of this kind of hydrate reservoir.

AB  - ABSTRACTThermal conduction and phase transformation are physical-chemical processes during the dissociation of gas hydrate-bearing sediments. Heat transfer leads to the expansion of hydrate dissociation front and the weakening of soils accompanied by the seepage of fluids and the deformation of sediments. As a consequence, ground failure may occur which can damage engineering structures and lead to environmental disasters. Hydrate dissociation in sediments is investigated using tetrahydrofuran (THF) hydrate sediments under various thermal strengths, and the time-dependent development of a hydrate-dissociation front is elucidated. An axial-symmetrical theoretical model and a numerical method are proposed based on experimental observations and analysis of the physical processes. Numerical and experimental results for evolution of the hydrate-dissociation front are in good agreement.

AB  - Abstract The objective of this study is to quantitatively assess the flow, thermal and geomechanical response of sloping oceanic accumulations of hydrates to stimuli that can induce dissociation, such as depressurization-induced gas production activities, with emphasis on the evaluation of the geomechanical stability of the well assembly and of the reservoir. Using numerical simulation, we analyze the coupled flow, thermal, thermodynamic, chemical and geomechanical processes involved in the response of sloping hydrate accumulations exposed to dissociation-inducing stimuli associated with depressurization-based activities for the production of gas from the hydrate-bearing sediments. The study includes a sensitivity analysis of the system behavior to the angle of the slope in order to determine its effect on the system behavior, and cover the system long-term behavior following the cessation of the stimuli. We determine that gas production from hydrate-bearing media may cause subsidence that increases stresses along the well and reduces gas production, but does not appear to enhance the risk of hillslope stability while production continues. The risk of oceanic landslides increases slightly after the end of gas production as a result of the increase in the pressure in the reservoir where the hydrate (which imparts the bulk of mechanical strength to the unconsolidated oceanic sediments) is depleted or exhausted, but at no time is the system stability compromised for any slope angle. The paper provides an integrated quantitative analysis of the coupled processes that are involved in dissociating hydrates using themost advanced simulators, and makes significant contributions to the evaluation and risk assessment of potential problems associated with future production from oceanic hydrate deposits, in addition to providing insights that may lead to mitigation of the problems.

AB  - ABSTRACT In this particular paper we propose a new, and simple technique to predict one of the most important physical properties of hydrates namely the heat of hydrate dissociation (∆Hd ) at temperatures above 273.15K. It is shown that it is possible to determine ∆Hd by knowledge of the size of the guest gas molecules. To a first approximation, the enthalpy of dissociation is independent of the type and the concentration of the guest gas, with the size constraint. Also as a notable outcome most natural gases containing appreciable amounts of methane and propane should have essentially the same heat of dissociation. INTRODUCTION In natural gas production and processing, hydrates are normally considered to be nuisances because free water combines with natural gas molecules to form crystals which plug flow channels and impede flow. One recent literature citation (Boniface, 1990) of this particular phenomenon is hypothesized to have caused the Piper Alpha platform disaster in the North Sea. Great efforts have been devoted to prevent hydrates from forming and from dissociating once they are formed. Dissociation is normally affected by depressurizing the transfer line, before cleaning the line with a device called a "pig". Models for hydrate dissociation have been proposed by the laboratories of Bishnoi (Kim et al., 1987; Jamaluddin et al., 1989), (Holder et al., 1982, 1986), (Kamath and Godbole, 1987) and this laboratory (Ullerich et al., 1987; Selim and Sloan, 1985, 1989). In all of the reported dissociation models, the most important physical parameter is (lHd ) , the heat of dissociation, defined as the heat required to turn the hydrates into flowing phases of gas and liquid water. The purpose of this work is to provide means of quick estimate of the heat of dissociation, if the gas composition is known.

AB  - ABSTRACTWe present results of numerical simulation of dissociation behavior of methane hydrates in laboratory experiments conducted at the Institute for Geo-Resources and Environment in Tsukuba, Japan. The hydrate was formed in packed sand columns and the dissociation behavior was studied under different stimulation conditions including hot-water injection and/or pressure reduction. A number of variables including amount of gas produced, temperature along the column and pressure difference across the column were monitored. A numerical model for hydrate behavior was developed, based on the FEHM (Finite Element Heat and Mass) Computer Code, the Los Alamos National Laboratory (LANL)''s in-house porous flow simulator. Capability to simulate the general behavior of hydrates in porous media was added to the simulator, including the kinetic, thermodynamic and heat transfer processes. Multiple conceptual models were used to simulate the experimental data. The simulation results indicate that incorporation of both dissociation and hydrate formation is necessary to better match the experimental data.INTRODUCTIONHydrates of methane gas represent a substantial energy resource. It is believed that methane stored in hydrate form may exceed the energy content of the total fossil fuel reserves (Makogan, 1988, Kvenvolden, 1988). Despite the vastness of this resource, it is not yet significantly exploited. A large amount of work has been done to understand fundamental behavior of pure gas hydrates (Sloan, 1997). On the other hand, hydrate behavior in porous media is not yet completely understood. Improving understanding of the fundamental hydrate behavior in porous media such as its formation/dissociation behavior, fluid flow behavior is important in order to determine effective production strategies. A number of researchers have reported work related to hydrate behavior in porous media. Selim and Sloan (1990) reported on hydrate dissociation experiments using hot water injection.

AB  - ABSTRACTA core holder was installed in a High-Speed X-ray CT scanner to observe the dissociation behavior of methane hydrate-bearing sediment. Artificial methane hydrate-bearing sediment was made and dissociated by the depressurization method. As a result, pore pressure in the sediment decreased immediately and the sediment temperature decreased proportionally to dissociation pressure. The CT luminance value decreased with the decomposition because hydrates in the sediment pore space replaced by methane gases.INTRODUCTIONIn order to use methane hydrate as an energy resource, it is necessary to establish decomposition methods for efficiently extracting methane gas from the methane hydrate-bearing layer. As a representative gas production method, there are depressurization method and thermal recovery method.Artificial methane hydrate-bearing sediment was made in a core holder type pressure vessel as reported in a previous study (Chuvilin et al., 2003), and a decomposition experiment was conducted by the above methods. These experiments demonstrated that the permeability of gas and water through the methane hydrate sediment largely influenced gas production rate. It is therefore important to know how the dissociated methane gas and water flow through the methane hydrate-bearing sediments.An X-ray Computed Tomography (CT) scanner, which can examine samples nondestructively, can be a powerful tool in such applications. There are several studies about investing natural gas hydrate sediments using medical X-ray CT equipment (Uchida et al., 1997; Uchida et al., 2004). Jin et al. (2004) studied the structure of gas hydrate sediments using a microfocus X-ray CT. However, it is difficult to apply standard medical X-ray CT to natural gas hydrate dissociation because it usually takes a long time to scan one image.Sato et al. (2005) developed a high-speed X-ray CT device and related imaging techniques.

AB  - ABSTRACTNatural gas hydrate that exists in the sediment is thought to constitute a large natural gas reservoir and is expected to be an energy resource in the future. In order to make recovery of natural gas from hydrates commercially viable, hydrates must be dissociated in-situ. Inhibitor injection method is thought to be one of the effective dissociation method as well as depressurization and thermal stimulation. In this study, dissociation behavior of an artificial hydrate core sample in inhibitor aqueous solution (methanol aqueous solution) was investigated experimentally. A newly constructed experimental set-up equipped with core holder achieves to investigate the dissociation behavior of hydrate core sample under similar condition under seafloor. Warm inhibitor aqueous solution is injected into the core sample. The heat supplied by the solution dissociates hydrate. Experiment is carried out varying the temperature and concentration of inhibitor. As a result, it becomes clear that inhibitor that changes the hydrate stability condition accelerates the hydrate dissociation rate effectively. Additionally specific feature that temperature of solution from outlet of core changes continuously, while outlet temperature does not change in case of pure water. This result suggests that the inhibitor concentration around hydrate surface should change continuously.INTRODUCTIONNatural gas hydrate is crystalline compounds that can contain large amount of natural gas in it (Sloan, 1998). Owing to resent seismic explorations and geological researches, it is widely known that natural gas hydrate that exists in the sediment constitutes a large natural gas reservoir and is expected to be an energy resource in the future (Brooks et al., 1986; Kvenvolden, 1988; Kvenvolden et al., 1993; Okuda, 1993; Gornitz and Fung, 1994; Sassen, 2001). In order to make recovery of natural gas from hydrates commercially viable, hydrates must be dissociated in-situ.

AB  - A heat transfer model in NGH sediments during drilling fluid deep-circulation and a dynamics model of NGH decomposition, in which the temperature-difference driving process is mainly considered, are established to evaluate NGH dissociation and gas and water production during deep-sediment penetration. A local overpressure generation model from NGH dissociation is constructed to calculate the induced overpressure and shallow gas (SG) and shallow water flow (SWF) formation under various conditions. Investigated are the effects of drilling fluid circulating temperature and NGH saturation on NGH dissociation and overpressure (SG and SWF) formation processes. The results indicate that the heat conduction from circulating drilling mud to NGH formation is so slow that local overpressure will only be developed within about 1.5m around the wellbore for 9 days of drilling fluids deep-circulation under typical operation conditions. For the typical NGH bearing sediment, an overpressure as high as 2.4MPa will be induced within the formation about 1.5m around the wellbore after about 9 days of drilling fluid deep-sediment circulation. This will exert great threat on the safety of cement sheaths and NGH sediment caps. During deep-sediment penetration and drilling mud circulation, the NGH saturation has more significant effects on NGH decomposition and local overpressure development than mud circulating temperature. 100% increase of drilling mud circulating temperature will result in only 10% increment of the local overpressure around the wellbore, while 100% increase of NGH saturation will result in 130% augment of in-situ overpressure.

AB  - Summary. Vast quantities of natural gas deposits exist in the form of solid hydrates. Methane gas hydrate was formed and dissociated for the first time in Berea core samples. A three-phase ID model was developed to simulate the process of gas production from Berea sandstone samples containing methane hydrate by means of a depressurization mechanism. The model closely matched the experimental data of gas and water production, the progress of the dissociation front, and the pressure and production, the progress of the dissociation front, and the pressure and saturation profiles. IntroductionNatural-gas hydrates are crystalline, ice-like substances belonging to a class of compounds called clathrates. These chemical compounds have natural-gas molecules bound within almost spherical water cages through physical rather than chemical bonds. Two natural-gas-hydrate crystal structures result from the combination of these water cages. The crystal properties of both structures have been reviewed in detail. When all cavities of either structure are occupied, there are about 15 gas molecules per 85 water molecules. Therefore, the enclathrated gas concentration is much higher than the gas solubility in water (usually on the order of one part per thousand). The effect of this concentration is that each volume of hydrate can contain as many as 170 volumes of gas at standard conditions. Kvenvolden estimated that the total gas reserve in hydrates is 1.87x10(17) std m3. Many schemes have evolved for the recovery of such a large resource of natural gas bound in the solid state. The three most practical schemes are (1) thermal stimulation, in which an external practical schemes are (1) thermal stimulation, in which an external source of energy is used; (2) depressurization, in which the pressure of an adjacent gas phase is lowered to cause decomposition; pressure of an adjacent gas phase is lowered to cause decomposition; and (3) inhibitor injection, in which methanol or some combination of inhibitors is used to disequilibrate the system. Of these schemes, only the first two have been addressed through mathematical modeling. Thermal-stimulation models have emerged from four laboratories. Depressurization, on the other hand, has been the method used in the single example of hydrate production from the Messoyakha field in the U.S.S.R. Verigin et al. proposed an isothermal depressurization model in which heat was assumed to flow instantaneously from the surroundings to the hydrate body. Holder and Angert proposed a methane-hydrate global depressurization model in which the heat of dissociation came from the sensible heat of the reservoir itself. Burshears et al. extended this model to gas mixtures. Yousif et al. proposed a model similar to the Russian moving-boundary model, but allowed for a temperature gradient within the hydrated zone; this model, which has had some limited experimental confirmation, shows the inverse relationship of production with time, relative to the work of Verigin et al. In all the models proposed to date, the flow equations in a hydrate zone were not considered as a complement to the equations of mass and energy. One purpose of this work was to model the hydrate-depressurization process considering equations of change for both mass and momentum for each of the three phases present (gas, water, and hydrate) in the porous medium. It was our purpose to provide experimental measurements of slow, isothermal purpose to provide experimental measurements of slow, isothermal hydrate depressurization in porous media for confirmation or refinement of the model. Depressurization Model Consider a porous medium of uniform porosity occupying the region 0 less than x less than L. Initially, hydrate, water, and gas are at uniform pressure, p0, and temperature, To. At time t=0, the pressure at the boundary x=0 is lowered to a new pressure that is less than the equilibrium pressure, pe, and is held constant thereafter. Hydrate dissociation begins; pressure and saturation distributions develop throughout the system. Water and gas flow through the system because of the resultant pressure gradient and are produced at the boundary x=0. For simplicity, we assume that the depressurization process is carried out under isothermal conditions. Such an assumption is valid only if the boundary pressure is not far enough below the equilbrium pressure to ensure slow dissociation. With this restriction, the pressure to ensure slow dissociation. With this restriction, the transport equations governing hydrate dissociation and the flow of gas and water through the porous medium are (1) (2) (3) The quantity -mH in Eq. 3 represents the local mass rate of hydrate dissociated per unit volume as a result of depressurization. The quantities mg and mw in Eqs. 1 and 2 represent the corresponding local mass rate of gas and water produced per unit volume, respectively. These are related by (4) (5) The local gas-generation rate caused by hydrate dissociation may be obtained from the Kim-Bishnoi model: (6) During the dissociation process, the volume occupied by the gas and water continuously increases with time as a result of depletion of the hydrate phase. Accordingly, the PV occupied gas and water and the permeability of the porous medium will be changing continuously with time. Let phi wg denote the PV occupied by water and gas per unit volume of porous medium. Assuming that the hydrate phase forms a continuous film coating the interior of the solid phase forms a continuous film coating the interior of the solid surface of the porous medium, we may use the parallel-cylinder model to obtain the following relationship for the specific surface area occupied by water and gas: (7) SPERE P. 69

AB  - Abstract Constant energy molecular dynamics simulations are used to study the role of mass and heat transfer in the decomposition of methane hydrate. The rate of methane hydrate decomposition in a constant energy simulation is affected by heat and mass transfer arising from the breakup of the hydrate framework and release of the methane gas into the liquid phase. As the hydrate undergoes endothermic dissociation, temperature gradients are established between the remaining solid hydrate and the solution phases. Hydrate dissociation occurs in a concerted fashion with rows of sI cages parallel to the interface decomposing simultaneously. This leads to the release of large amounts of methane gas near the solid-liquid interface which can form bubbles that affect the rate of mass transfer between the phases. These phenomena can affect the rate of methane hydrate decomposition in natural methane hydrate reservoirs. I. Introduction Understanding the mechanism of methane hydrate decomposition under conditions similar to those of the hydrate sediments found on continental margins, under the ocean floor, and under the permafrost in the Arctic can assist in designing controlled methane recovery processes.[1-4] Hydrates can become unstable when heated or depressurized and this can lead to uncontrolled hydrate decomposition and catastrophic methane release. A sustained method of methane extraction from hydrate reservoirs is yet to be established. From experimental calorimetric measurements methane structure I (sI) clathrate has a heat of dissociation of 18.13 ± 0.27 kJ/mol (hydrate ? ice + gas) at 273 K and 101 kPa[5] and 54.4 ± 1.4 kJ/mol (hydrate? liquid + gas) at 292 K over a range of pressures up to 20 MPa.[6]

AB  - ABSTRACTIn this work, we studied the step-down dissociation process of methane hydrate in three typical inorganic salt solutions (sodium chloride, potassium chloride and calcium chloride). Based on the experimental results and Kim-Bishnoi model, a kinetic model of hydrate dissociation was derived. The results showed that, with the decrease of pressure, the pressure difference between the reactor and the three-phase equilibrium increased, and the hydrate dissociation was enhanced, that is, the methane hydrate dissociation rate increased. With the increase of the initial injection in mass concentration of inorganic salt solutions, the methane hydrate dissociation rate was accelerated. When the pressure was above 2.0 MPa, the dissociation rate mainly depended on the mass concentration of inorganic salt solutions. And if the pressure was below 1.5 MPa, pressure became the main affecting factor to control the dissociation rate. At the same pressures, the dissociation rate of methane hydrate in NaCl was the fastest, followed by KCl and CaCl2 during the mass concentration of 5%∼30%, and the higher the mass concentration was, the closer the dissociation rate was among the different solutions. The results were helpful for the selection of depressurization and inorganic salts during the process of development of hydrates or removing hydrate plugs.INTRODUCTIONNatural gas hydrates are considered as a potential energy resource in the 21st century, and bring worldwide attention onto their production (Makogon Y. F. et al., 2007; Lu et al., 2011). At the same time, hydrate formation in the upper annulus, BOP stacks and choke/kill lines can also pose serious threats to the safe and effective completion of deepwater drilling operations (Zamora M et al., 2000). So far, many technologies are developed to produce natural gas hydrate (Lu et al., 2016). The main technologies can be summed up to four kinds, including depressurization method (Li et al., 2012), thermal stimulation method (Wang Y et al., 2013), chemical injection method (Li G et al., 2007) and CO2 replacement method (Bai D et al., 2012; Komatsu H et al., 2013). And the first three methods can also be used to remove pipe plugging, among which the depressurization in conjunction with thermal stimulation is the most popular combination. Compared with the kinetic inhibitors and anti-agglomerants, thermodynamic inhibitors are usually selected to prevent hydrates in the oil field with the advantage of effectiveness and low-price (Tavasoli H et al., 2011; Mohammadi A H et al., 2010). However, this method still has many problems in the oil field operation, such as over-dosage, inhibitor selection, etc., which lead to an increasing cost in gas hydrate exploitation and an aggravated environment around oil field.

AB  - We have carried out an experimental study on dissociation of methane hydrate (MH) by hot-water injection as a thermal stimulation method. On the basis of the experimental results, a numerical model of MH dissociation was designed to develop a gas production simulator. The numerical model consists of a 3-phase, 3-component system, such as gas, MH and water. As MH was not mobile due to its solid material, we defined the gas-water 2-phase flow with MH formation. Further, absolute permeability and relative permeability with MH formation were measured experimentally and formulated as functions of MH saturation. Using the developed simulator, we conducted history matching of laboratory-scale experiments for MH dissociation by hot-water injection. INTRODUCTIONMethane hydrate (MH) is an ice-like solid substance in which a water molecule structure contains embedded methane molecules under low-temperature and high-pressure conditions. When 1 m3 of MH is decomposed, approximately150 m3 of methane gas are produced. In the near future, MH will be a potential resource of natural gas, because of the vast amounts of reservoirs that exist in marine sediments and in permafrost regions worldwide (Makogon, 1988; Okuda, 1993; Sato et al., 2001a, b). Some extraction methods of MH from reservoirs in marine sediments have been proposed, such as depressurization, thermal stimulation and inhibitor injection (Makogon, 1981). These are all based on the in-situ dissociation of MH that is transformed into methane gas and water. Only methane gas can be produced from the reservoirs in marine sediments. Fig. 1 shows the concept of MH extraction from marine sediments. It is supposed that this process consists of the following complicated physical phenomena: • The porosity and permeability of porous media are changed as a result of MH dissociation. • Dissociated gas and water migrate through pore space, which is formed by the extinction of MH crystals that function as a binder between sand grains.

AB  - AbstractDeep Star funded a unique hydrate plug dissociation field test in a 900-psi 4-inch flowline gathering system operated by Kerr-McGee Corporation/Devon Energy in the Powder River Basin in Wyoming. In addition to DeepStar, the field test was supported by seven DeepStar member f m s (Amoco, ARCO, BP, Chevron, Kerr-McGee, Shell, and Texaco) by loan of equipment and analytical and computer services. During the field test, the formation of naturally occurring hydrate plugs was allowed in an existing flowline by stopping methanol injection. After formation, plugs were remediated by a unique one-sided depressurization. This reduction of the pressure on one side of the plug to below the hydrate decomposition curve results in a substantial pressure drop across the plug, as well as partial dissociation of the low pressure end of the plug that is outside the hydrate region. Plug formation and remediation were monitored by five data stations along the line. The pressure drop across a plug was monitored as a function of time to determine plug permeability while the plug was stationary. The pressure drop across a plug and the plug length were used to determine plug yield strength at breakaway. A dual-station gamma-ray system was used to measure slug and plug lengths and velocities at one data station. IntroductionHydrates are ice-like solids that form in hydrocarbon flowlines. Hydrates can deposit on the flowline inner wall and agglomerate in the flow stream, and with time, hydrates can block the flowline. Hydrate operational problems are most severe in high pressure flowlines in cold environments, such as in deep waters around the world where the seawater tem- perature is typically between 34° and 40°F. Hydrates are members of a chemical class of compounds Hydrocarbon water systems. Hydrates are solids composed of water and a gas (methane, CO,, etc.). The water forms a crystal lattice of cavities with pentagonal and hexagonal surfaces. Each cavity, or cage, may enclose a single mkthane (or other foreign) molecule.In some ways. hydrates are similar to ice. Hydrates have a density close to that of ice, and have an appearance like frost or ice. However, in contrast to ice, the decomposition temperature of hydrates increases with increasing pressure at pressures below 15,000 psi. A hydrate thermodynamic equilibriumcurve, or decomposition curve, (bold line) for a hypothetical oil/water/gas production system is shown in Fig. 1. The decomposition curve starts at around 100 psi and 34°F and rises to 3,000 psi at around 70°F. Hydrates may form at temperatures below and pressures above the hydrate decomposition curve. Also shown in Fig. 1 is a pressure-temperature profile curve (thin line with arrows) of produced fluids in a flowline from deepwater wells to a shallow water platform 40 to 60 miles away.

AB  - ABSTRACTWe developed a ring shear apparatus with a permeability measurement system in order to clarify the relationship between methane hydrate dissociation and faults of methane hydrate-bearing sediment. Sandy sediment with tohoku No. 7 [Minagawa, 2007] sand was examined in a preliminary experiment. Loading with 8.0MPa and ring shearing of 3.0m with a speed of 0.00204m/min decreased the permeability of the sandy sediment from 4.0x10-12m2 to 4.0x10-16 m2 for water flow in a vertical direction. Grain-size distribution analysis with scanning electron microscopy (SEM) indicated that the decrease in permeability was caused by a decrease in grain size around the shearing surface.

AB  - ABSTRACTThe mechanical properties of hydrate bearing sediments may deteriorate as a result of hydrate dissociation due to heating of the wellbore casing, with possible adverse effects on the stability of the casing. The authors have created a numerical model in plane strain in order to simulate the stability of a well-bore supported with a casing. The model captures the interaction between the formation, casing, cement and cement-casing bond. The simulation results demonstrate that the safety factor of the casing is very dependent on the quality of the cement, for with strong cement, it is multiples of the safety factor of the casing with weak cement. The safety factor for the casing with weak cement, in the presence of hydrates in the formation, reduces due to hydrate dissociation and the subsequent deterioration of the mechanical strength of the formation. This paper shows that in this case an effective cement placement around the casing becomes crucial in order to keep the casing factor within acceptable limits.INTRODUTIONCasing deformation resulting from reservoir compaction and surface subsidence during the primary production stage has been analysed and reported by many investigators 1,2,3. Generally the following effects can be considered: Pressure depletion in the formation, which can lead to subsidence and possible shearing of the casing Heating the formation, which can generate high stresses in the formation Deterioration of the sediment mechanical properties due to heating as for hydrate bearing sediments, which can induce large stress in the casing.Casing integrity for well drilled in hydrate bearing sediments presents a challenge that is explored in this paper. Gas hydrate, or clathrates, are ice-like deposits containing a mixture of water and gas, the most common gas being methane. Other gases of small molecular size such as CO2? H2S, ethane and higher hydrocarbons are also found in natural gas hydrates. Gas hydrates are stable under high pressure and low temperature conditions, and hence they can be found in deepwater settings at relatively shallow depths below the seafloor and in permafrost regions 4. The dissociation of gas hydrates can take place due to a reduction in pressure and /or an increase in temperature, or due to the injection of certain chemicals that may affect hydrate stability. Once melted due to the circulation of hot fluid in the casing. Hydrate bearing sediments will suffer degradation in their mechanical properties (e.g, strength and stiffness), accompanied by overpressure development . Moreover the gas released by hydrate dissociation may undermine the quality of the cement supporting the casing (if dissociation takes place before the cement is fully cured ) and hence reduce the collapse resistance of the casing6. This the well by the surrounding sediments in response to heating. Some of the sediment considered are hydrate bearing sediments (HBS). The cements examined could be strong cement (foam cement) or weaker cement (hard cement). The cement-casing bond strength is investigated in the modelling. The modelling is performed using FLAC3D, which is a continuum code developed by Itasca Consulting Group 7,8.

AB  - Summary. The two most promising techniques for producing natural gas from hydrate reservoirs are depressurization and brine injection. This paper examines the dissociation characteristics of methane hydrates during these processes. A correlation for the rate of hydrate dissociation during brine injection as a function of salinity, brine temperature, brine injection rate, pressure, and hydrate/brine surface area is presented. Depressurization experiments show that hydrate dissociation results in a decrease in the rate of pressure decline and contributes significantly (15% to 70%) to the cumulative gas production. IntroductionExtensive deposits of naturally occurring gas hydrates have been found in many regions of the world. Because the formation of gas hydrates requires such favorable thermodynamic conditions as low temperatures and high pressures along with physical contact of natural gas with water, in-situ natural gas hydrates occur in three types of environments: (1 Arctic onshore sediments overlain by a continuous thick permafrost layer (e.g., Prudhoe Bay and Kuparuk River area of Alaska's North Slope, Canada's Mackenzie delta and Northwest Territories, and Messoyakha and other arctic regions of Russian Siberia); (2) sediments underneath arctic offshore waters (e.g., Beaufort Sea shelf and slope, Bering Sea slope, Navarin and Aleutian basins, North Pacific Ocean, and the Gulf of Alaska; and (3) deep marine offshore sediments in tropical regions (e.g., off-shore Guatemala, Gulf of Mexico, Blake Bahamas, Baltimore Canyon, North Sea, and offshore California). Because of the potentially large size of this resource, gas hydrates are considered as a future, unconventional resource of natural gas. Recovery Methods for Hydrate Reservoirs Gas hydrates are relatively immobile and impermeable; hence, it is essential to decompose them into gas and water before gas can be produced from hydrate reservoirs. The transformation of solid gas hydrates to gas and water requires latent heat of hydrate dissociation. Several techniques proposed for decomposing natural gas hydrates are based on three common principles: (1) reduction in reservoir pressure below the equilibrium hydrate-dissociation pressure, as in the depressurization method; (2) heating the reservoir above the hydrate-dissociation temperature by external means, as in such thermal recovery methods as hot-water, steam, or brine injection; and (3) injection of chemicals, such as methanol and glycol, that act as hydrate inhibitors and reduce the hydrate-dissociation temperature. Each method has merits and disadvantages. Holder et al. reported that the heat required to dissociate hydrates is only 10% of the heating value of the produced natural gas. Thus, the thermal recovery methods are energy efficient from the thermodynamic viewpoint. In steam injection, however, the heat losses in the well-bore and reservoir can be severe, especially for thinner hydrate zones. Hot-water injection will yield lower heat losses than steam injection, but the injectivity of water in the hydrate reservoirs will govern the applicability of this method. Fracturing can be used to improve water injectivity, but that may result in lower heat-transfer efficiencies because of channeling effects. Use of glycol and methanol for dissociating hydrates is governed by economics because large quantities of these expensive chemicals are needed to ensure sufficient gas production. With results of the mathematical model for the hot-brine simulation technique, Kamath and Godbole showed that injection of hot brine to dissociate hydrates is thermally more efficient than steam or hot water because brine also acts as a hydrate inhibitor. Brine causes reduction in dissociation temperature which reduces reservoir heating, causes latent heat of dissociation and heat losses, and increases the gas production rate. In the depressurization method, hydrates dissociate by means of heat conduction from the surrounding formations. The rate of dissociation, however, is controlled by the thermal conductivity of the surrounding formations. In cases where hydrates overlie a free-gas zone, this technique is advantageous because hydrate dissociation can contribute significantly to gas production from a free-gas zone. This method has been used commercially to produce natural gas from hydrates in the Messoyakha field in the USSR. Hydrate-Dissociation Phenomenon The hydrate-dissociation phenomenon is more complex than melting or sublimation processes because it involves the presence of three phases: gas, water, and solid hydrates. Experimental data on dissociation characteristics of propane and methane hydrates during hot-water injection showed that the rate of hydrate dissociation is a function of the temperature-driving force at the hydrate/water interface and interfacial area. The heat transfer to dissociating hydrates is considered to be analogous to the nucleate boiling phenomenon. Selim and Sloan considered the hydrate-dissociation process under thermal stimulation to be a moving-boundary ablation process and presented a mathematical model that assumes that the water formed by dissociation is blown away from the hydrate surface by the produced gas. Ullerich et al. conducted an experimental study to measure methane hydrate-decomposition -rates under constant heat-flux conditions. Their experimental results agreed with Selim and Sloan's model within 10%. Selim and Sloans extended their earlier model to consider hydrate dissociation in porous media. Roadifer et al. presented a 2D finite-difference thermal model to simulate dissociation of hydrates in porous media in cylindrical geometry by considering the process to be a classic movingboundary Stefan problem. Kim et al. experimentally studied the intrinsic kinetics of the decomposition of methane hydrates with a semicontinuous stirred tank reactor. They described the process as destruction of the host (water) lattice at the surface of a hydrate particle and desorption of the guest (methane) molecules from the surface. Jamaluddin et al. 11 recently developed a mathematical model for the decomposition of a hydrate block under thermal stimulation conditions by coupling the intrinsic kinetics with the heat-transfer rates. Other hydrate-reservoir-simulation studies under thermal stimulation conditions include frontal sweep and fracture flow models for hot-water injection, 12 a single-well cyclic-steam simulation model, and a hot-brine stimulation model. McGuire also presented a model for hydrate dissociation under a depressurization scheme. Holder et al. presented simulation results for depressurization of a hydrate reservoir overlying a free-gas zone. SPEFE, December 1991 P. 477^

AB  - Abstract A mathematical model for hydrate dissociation has been developed. The model assumes dissociation of a pure hydrate using a constant heat flux incident an a pure hydrate using a constant heat flux incident an a planar semi-infinite medium with constant physical planar semi-infinite medium with constant physical properties. The water formed during dissociation is properties. The water formed during dissociation is assumed to be blown away by the gas so that the dissociation process may be regarded as a moving-boundary ablation problem. The governing differential equation describing the rate of dissociation are presented and solution is obtained using the Von-Karman integral method. Results from this solution are presented in graphs which can be used to estimate the amount of hydrate dissociated as a function of time. Introduction Natural gas hydrates represent a substantial in situ natural gas reserve and resource. In order to recover the natural gas from this resource, it is necessary to dissociate the water structure surrounding the natural gas molecules and remove the gas. Several ways for dissociating hydrates have been suggested. These include thermal stimulation, in-situ combustion, depressurization, and injection of hydrate inhibitors. holder et al. (1982) showed that the thermal recovery technique is energy efficient from the thermodynamic viewpoint. McGuire (1981) and Bayles et al. (1984) claim that thermal stimulation techniques are most attractive for gas hydrate dissociation. In the present work a mathematical model for hydrate dissociation present work a mathematical model for hydrate dissociation under thermal stimulation is presented. A planar one-dimensional semi infinite system is considered; although generalization to cylindrical spherical or finite geometry presents no difficulty. Furthermore, a radiant heat source, as a mean for thermally dissociating the hydrate, is assumed in the present model. This heating method has been selected since it is easy to control in the laboratory relative to a prescribed temperature or a convection boundary condition. It is currently being used experimentally by Ullerich (1985) for hydrate dissociation. Thus, experimental data from this investigation can be compared directly to predictions from the model. Generalizations of the predictions from the model. Generalizations of the model, however, to other heating conditions pose no problem. problem. MATHEMATICAL FORMULATION Consider a hyrate body initially at a uniform temperature Ti and occupying the semi-infinite region O less than x less than . At time t=O a constant heat flux F is applied to the boundary surface at x=O. Dissociation starts and as a result the boundary surface moves in the positive x-direction. Meanwhile, the temperature of the boundary rises from Ti to Ts which is the temperature in equilibrium with the prevailing pressure. Thereafter, the temperature of the moving pressure. Thereafter, the temperature of the moving boundary remains constant at Ts. To simplify the analysis, it is assumed that the water resulting from the dissociation process is completely removed from the surface process is completely removed from the surface immediately on formation. Effectively the gas blows the water away from the surface. Such an assumption is usually encountered in ablation problems (Goodman, 1964). There will therefore be no liquid phase over the dissociation surface and we need only consider the heat transfer problem in the undissociated solid phase. Let tsd be the time required for the boundary surface to reach the equilibrium temperature Ts. For moderately large values of heat input, F, tsd will be fairly small so that the motion of the boundary surface may be ignored during that initial period. Thus, for t less than tsd the problem may be regarded as a fixed-boundary problem while for t>tsd the problem becomes a problem while for t>tsd the problem becomes a movingboundary problem. The fixed-boundary problem may be then regarded as a heating problem preceding dissociation. The appropriate differential equations and associated boundary and initial conditions are given by: for t less than tsd (1) (2) (3) (4) P. 75

AB  - Abstract Paleooceanographic evidence has been used to postulate that methane from oceanic hydrates may have had a significant role in regulating climate. However, the behavior of contemporary oceanic methane hydrate deposits subjected to rapid temperature changes, like those now occurring in the arctic and those predicted under future climate change scenarios, has only recently been investigated. Field investigations have discovered substantial methane gas plumes exiting the seafloor along the Arctic Ocean margin, and the plumes appear at depths corresponding to the upper limit of a receding gas hydrate stability zone. It has been suggested that these plumes may be the first visible signs of the dissociation of shallow hydrate deposits due to ongoing climate change in the arctic.   We simulate the release of methane from multiple oceanic deposits, including the effects of fully-coupled heat transfer, fluid flow, hydrate dissociation, and other thermodynamic processes for systems representative of segments of the Arctic Ocean margin. The model encompasses a cross section of marginal sediments from the upper extent of the hydrate stability zone down to depths beyond the expected range of century-scale temperature changes. We impose temperature changes corresponding to predicted rates of climate change-related ocean warming and examine the possibility of hydrate dissociation and the release of methane. The simulation results are consistent with the hypothesis that dissociating shallow hydrates may contribute to the formation of undersea methane plumes, and that dissociating hydrate along can result in significant methane fluxes at the seafloor. However, the methane release is likely to be confined to a narrow region of high dissociation susceptibility, defined by depth and temperature, and that any release will be continuous and controlled, rather than explosive. These results also indicate the possibility that hydrate dissociation and methane release may be both a result and a cause of climate change. This modeling also establishes the first realistic bounds for methane release along the arctic continental shelf for potential hydrate dissociation scenarios, and ongoing work may help confirm whether climate change is already impacting the stability of the vast oceanic hydrate reservoir.   Introduction Gas hydrates are solid crystalline compounds in which gas molecules are lodged within the lattices of water clathrate crystals1. Natural gas hydrate deposits occur in geologic settings where the necessary low temperatures and high pressures exist for their formation and stability--in the permafrost and in deep ocean sediments. The existing literature indicates that the global methane hydrate reserves are enormous. These estimates began with an initial ?consensus value? of 10,000 Gt through work by various investigators.2,3,4 More recently, Milkov5 proposed a total of 500-2,500 Gt of methane-derived carbon, but two of the most recent studies have produced a wider range, from an upper estimate of 74,400 Gt of methane carbon in hydrate form6 (27,300 Gt along continental margins) a lower estimate of 3,000 Gt of methane in hydrate and 2,000 Gt of gaseous methane existing in a stable state under current climate conditions7.

AB  - AbstractDeposits of naturally occurring methane hydrate have been identified in permafrost and deep oceanic environments with global reserves estimated to be twice the total amount of energy stored in fossil fuels. The fundamental behavior of methane hydrate in natural formations, while poorly understood, is of critical importance if the economic recovery of methane from hydrates is to be accomplished. In this study, computed X-ray tomography (CT) scanning is used to image an advancing dissociation front in a heterogeneous gas hydrate/sand sample at 0.1 MPa. The cylindrical methane hydrate and sand aggregate, 2.54 cm in diameter and 6.3 cm long, was contained in a PVC sample holder that was insulated on all but one end. At the uninsulated end, the dissociated gas was captured and the volume of gas monitored. The sample was initially imaged axially using X-ray CT scanning within the methane hydrate stability zone by keeping the sample temperature at 77°K. Subsequently, as the sample warmed through the methane hydrate dissociation point at 194°K and room pressure, gas was produced and the temperature at the bottom of the sample plug was monitored while CT images were acquired. The experiment showed that CT imaging can resolve the reduction in density (as seen by a reduction in beam attenuation) of the hydrate/sand aggregate due to the dissociation of methane hydrate. In addition, a comparison of CT images with gas flow and temperature measurements reveals that the CT scanner is able to resolve accurately and spatially the advancing dissociation front. Future experiments designed to better understand the thermodynamics of hydrate dissociation are planned to take advantage of the temporal and spatial resolution that the CT scanner provides.IntroductionIn the oil and gas industry, gas hydrate research has traditionally focused on designing improved methods to prevent its formation in conduits where it impedes fluid transport in subsea or permafrost operations (1,2,3). More recently, the interest in hydrates has been directed towards understanding of the vast potential of gas hydrates as a natural gas resource (4). Field, laboratory, and theoretical work have begun to focus on the many aspects of gas hydrates including reserve evaluation, hydrate recovery, gas production, hydrate formation, hydrate properties, dissociation, depressurization modeling, and thermal gas production from hydrates (5). To help refine current models of gas production from natural gas hydrate accumulations (6), a better understanding of the physical processes that occur during methane hydrate dissociation is critically important. Many physical and hydrologic properties of hydrate/sediment aggregates require evaluation to gain a further understanding of the potential for gas recovery from hydrates. These properties include relative permeability, thermal conductivity, heat capacity, and compaction. While various aspects of gas hydrate formation and dissociation have been investigated on both natural (7) and synthetic (8,9) gas hydrate test materials, synthetic hydrates offer the advantage of better sample control and uniformity than natural materials. Furthermore, representative natural hydrate samples have proved to be very difficult to collect. Imaging methods, such as X-ray Computed Tomography (CT), have been used to characterize naturally occurring hydrates (10) or to directly observe their dissociation while reducing the ambient pressure below the stability pressure (11). In this study, we describe CT scanning experiments on an aggregated sample of methane hydrate with quartz sand, and show how this technique can be used successfully to image an advancing dissociation front due to heat influx applied to one end of the sample, at a constant pressure of 0.1 MPa.

AB  - Based on an assumed vertical pipeline in seabed, which contains sand and gas hydrate sediment, the deformation and stress of pipeline and sediment are numerically simulated with the different area of gas hydrate dissociation by using the business software ABAQUS. The effects of gas hydrate dissociation area and the thickness of overlaying sand sediment on the stability of pipeline are estimated. It is shown that gas hydrate dissociation obviously affects the deformation of pipeline and sediment. With the expansion of dissociation area, the deformation of pipeline and sediment increase obviously, the shear stress and the stress yielding area in sediment increase too. The pipeline is elastic and stable first, and then becomes to bend and finally be whole instability. When the thickness of overlaying sand sediment increases, the deformation of pipeline and surrounding sediment also increase because of the gravity and the sliding force of overlaying sand sediment.INTRODUCTION Gas hydrate is a new potential source of energy in the 21st century. More and more countries concentrate on surveying, studying gas hydrate now, and trying to produce methane gas from methane gas hydrate sediment in the future. But most of the previous researches pay much more attention to the exploitation of gas hydrate and concern about the in-situ investigation of natural gas hydrate and some laboratory simulation tests on synthesized samples containing methane gas hydrate.Previous studies have been concluded that gas hydrate dissociation can lower the effective stress in gas hydrate sediment and induce slope failures. The second Storegga slide in Norway (Locat J, Lee HJ, 2002; Hovland, M, Orange, D et al, 2001), Cape Fear slide in east coast of America and the landslide in continental shelf of west Africa (Kayer RE, Lee HJ, 1991; Sultan N, Cochonat P, Foucher J, 2004) and some other slides (Gilles, G, David, G, and Aaleksandr M, 1999) in ocean are all resulted by gas hydrate dissociation. So it is very important to know if the offshore structures in gas hydrate sediment are stable when gas hydrate dissociates.

AB  - AbstractHigh efficiency, economic, and safe exploitation of natural gas hydrate is an important researching topic. Mechanical-Thermal exploitation is new presented potential efficient method for shallow marine hydrate exploitation, and contains the following procedures: In-situ mining o: hydrate-bearing sediments, cutting the sediments into small bodies mixing the sediments with surface injected seawater, transporting the multiphase fluid with hydrate dissociation in the exploitation well, and backfilling the sediments, etc. The physical processes of small bodies of hydrate-bearing sediments and water flow accompanying hydratt dissociation are described in the main controlling parameters. Ther some trial observational tests are conducted to obtain information or the dissociation process of gas hydrate in small bodies under water. heating condition. IntroductionGas hydrate (GH) is a solid compound of hydrocarbon gas and water molecules. Gas hydrate-bearing sediments (GHBS) consist of hydrate water or/and gas, sand/clay etc. GH exists in cementing or filling status with soil skeleton, and widely distributes in the sea, permafrost and deep lakes (Kvenvolden and Lorenson, 2001; Koh, 2002; Song et al. 2014).Countries such as Russia, Canada, America and Japan have carried ou trial productions of GH in the permafrost (Makagon et al., 2005, 2013 ConocoPhillips, 2012a, b; Collett et al., 2012;) and deep marine (Fuji et al., 2013; Chee et al., 2014; Terao et al., 2015). The methods of GI-exploitation include thermal injection, depressurization, and CO2 displacement. The trial production of GH gives the confidence tha increasing temperature or/and decreasing pressure could release methane from GHBS in a short period, but the efficiencies of these productions are hard to satisfy a commercial-viable application.The physical processes in the production contain heat conduction, phase transformation, multiphase seepage and soil deformation (Moridis et al., 2009). The ratio of the characteristic times is 109:107:106:1. The heat conduction is the slowest physical effect, and controls the coupling processes. Lack lasting supply of heat into the GHBS leads to the low efficiencies of the in-situ trial production, and constrains the utilization of the methods such as depressurization and thermal injection (Hong et al., 2003; Zhang et al., 2014a).The formation and geological characteristics of GHBS in South China Sea are more complex and inhomogeneous. The reserve is large but in a scattered spatial distribution. The sediment is soft and the permeability is low. Through a preliminary estimation of thermal injection, the expansion length of hydrate dissociation zone gets to merely about 30 m after 20 years, leading to a serious situation of high investment and low profit, especially at the period of low price of international oil and natural gas (Zhang et al., 2014a, b).

AB  - Methane hydrate reformation was analyzed experimentally under the dissociation process. The authors investigated how the temperature and salinity of injected brine, and a hot-brine injection coupled with depressurization, affect methane hydrate reformation during dissociation. An experimental apparatus was constructed to dissociate the hydrate, which was to inject hot brine into an artificial hydrate-bearing sand column. The hydrate reformation could be recognized by observing a sharp increase of internal pressure. The salinity of hot brine was an effective factor in preventing hydrate reformation, while the temperature of hot brine played a minor role in the range of this study. The hot-brine injection that followed depressurization was more effective in inhibiting the hydrate reformation than the inverse case. INTRODUCTIONMethane hydrate, one of the gas clathrates, is composed of water molecules forming a rigid lattice of cages with most of the cages each containing methane molecules. It has been expected to become one of the alternative energy resources, but is currently considered unconventional. The environment found in both deep oceanic and permafrost regions can promote the formation of gas hydrates, where the condition of low temperature and high pressure prevails. As of now, the production methods are not commercialized but based on in situ dissociation of the hydrate into gas and water phases. The conceptual models of dissociation are divided into heat stimulation, depressurization, inhibitor injection, and any combination of these. The effectiveness of hot-brine injection, the association of heat, and salt as an inhibitor have been experimentally investigated (Kamath and Godbole, 1987; Kamath et al., 1991; Tang et al., 2005). The continuous injection of hot brine is essential to be efficient. However, if additional hydrate growth (i.e. the hydrate reformation) occurs due to a recombination of water and dissociated methane during continuous injection, the efficiency would decrease.

AB  - ABSTRACTMethane Hydrate (MH) is considered to be one of the new-generation energy resources. To support the method of extraction of methane gas from MH, laboratory experiments have been performed at the National Institute of Advanced Industrial Science and Technology (AIST), Tsukuba in Japan. In this paper, we present the results of the numerical simulation of these experiments. In these calculations, Finite Element Heat and Mass Transfer code, developed at the Los Alamos National Laboratory was used.INTRODUCTIONMethane Hydrate (MH), which occurs worldwide, is expected to be a major future energy resource. MH research is being conducted in many countries. In Japan, the Research Consortium for Methane Hydrate Resources in Japan (MH21 Research Consortium) has been controlled the R&D project from 2001(MH21 Japan, 2002). National Institute of Advanced Industrial Science and Technology (AIST) has conducted to develop the production methods of methane gas from MH reservoir in this project. In order to understand the basic process of MH, laboratory experiments were performed under this project. In this study, we present the results of numerical simulation of these experiments.Description of experimentsSeveral authors have reported work related on hydrate dissociation experiments (Yousif and Sloan, 1991, Kamath et al. 1991 and Masuda et al. 1999). These experiments were performed with Berea sandstone cores. In these laboratory experiments, Toyoura sand was used to make artificial sediment. As the details of the laboratory experiment of MH were reported by Sakamoto et al. (2004), we provide an outline of these experiments.The size of MH column was 65 mm in diameter and 540 mm in length. The apparatus is shown in Figure 1. Next, methane gas was injected in the vessel and water was replaced with gas. The vessel was frozen and MH was cooled with irreducible water and free gas.

AB  - ABSTRACTNatural gas hydrate that exists in the sediment is thought to constitute a large methane gas reservoir and is expected to be an energy resource in the future. In order to make recovery of natural gas from hydrates commercially viable, hydrates must be dissociated in-situ. Inhibitor injection method is thought to be one of the effective dissociation method as well as depressurization and thermal stimulation. But there is only limited information about dissociation kinetics in inhibitors, while there exist substantial phase equilibrium data.In our previous study, the experimental set-up had been developed to achieve the precise thermal analysis. The length of the core holder had been extended to 5 times longer to reproduce the thermal gradient in the core. In this study, the dissociation behavior of a hydrate core sample in methanol aqueous solution has been investigated using the developed experimental set-up. Warm methanol aqueous solution was injected through the core samples, which imitate natural gas hydrate sediment under seafloor. This approach could make clear that the specific feature of dissociation behavior using inhibitor injection. Temperature change was rather different from the case of water injection that made the hydrate dissociate fast. Also mass transfer at down stream was cleared that could not be detected by previous experimental apparatus. Recrystallization was observed.INTRODUCTIONNatural gas hydrates are crystalline compounds that can contain a large amount of natural gas (Sloan, 1998). Owing to recent seismic exploration and geological research, it is widely known that natural gas hydrate that exists in the sediment constitutes a large natural gas resource and is expected to be an energy source in the future (Makogon, 1981; Brooks et al., 1986; Kvenvolden, 1988; Kvenvolden et al., 1993; Okuda, 1993; Gornitz and Fung, 1994; Sassen, 2001).

AB  - ABSTRACT:In the recent activities of off-shore drillings conducted in Tokai-oki and Kumano-nada off the coast of Japan, MH21 research consortium of Japan confirmed methane hydrate in sandy and/or mud-sand alternation layers. Dissociation of methane hydrate existing in pore of marine sediments in deep water may result in strata deformation surrounding possible production wells in the future. A specially designed pressure vessel was used to clarify compaction behavior of methane hydrate bearing sediment during the dissociation of methane hydrate. In the study, methane hydrate was formed artificially in Toyoura sand which was densely compacted in the vessel, and compaction behavior on hydrate dissociation was monitored along with the measurements of vertical displacement, temperature and pore pressure. It was found that the displacement of Toyoura sand during hydrate dissociation approached finally to that of plain Toyoura sand. The experimental results imply that the final deformation is mainly caused by the depressurizing performance for methane hydrate dissociation. INTRODUCTIONDrilling survey for methane hydrate in the region of Kumano-nada to Tokai-oki has brought a prospective evidence of hydrate reservoir under the deep seafloor off the coast of Japan. MH21 research consortium of Japan has been developing a production simulator or a hydrate reservoir simulator from the beginning of the MH21 project. Our research group is providing a consolidation calculation module for the production simulator. Meanwhile, there is not much information on compaction behavior of sand reservoir during dissociation of methane hydrate. It is still difficult to have better understanding of real phenomena during dissociation of methane hydrate in production. Especially, mutual relationships among pore pressure, temperature and deformation in hydrate bearing sediment. Experimental achievement has not been made so far over strata deformation with regard to hydrate dissociation in sediment strata.

AB  - AbstractDesign of deep foundations within oceanic gas hydrate-bearing sediments (HBS) can be problematic and calls for special attention to incorporate the effect of gas hydrate melting. As naturally occurring gas hydrates in the seabed sediments begin dissociation process due to temperature or pressure changes, the pore pressure increases associated with volume expansion of the gas released during gas hydrate dissociation will likely result in fractures filled with pressurized fluid products open accompanied by softening of soil in gas and water intrusion zone together with seafloor and subsurface sediment motions.In this paper, a numerical approach is described to investigate the effects of gas hydrate dissociation induced by constant heating from a hot wellbore on sediment engineering properties and the radial extent of hydrate dissociation influence zone. The effects of the following process during gas hydrate melting on soil parameters are discussed: (1) thermal stresses; (2) gas exsolution during heating; (3) seepage- induced swelling effects and (4) fracturing. Estimation of hydrate dissociation influence zone employs numerical assessment of fracture formation taking into account of pore seepage of fluid and gas from fractures, which is premised on either (1) development of a pattern of laterally expanding horizontal fractures evenly spaced vertically throughout the hydrate-bearing zone and centered on the wellbore, or (2) development of vertical fractures which will intersect the seafloor to allow released gasses to vent into water column. If the fractures form vertically from the origin of hydrate dissociation, the effects of hydrate melting on sediment parameters for determining deep foundation capacities will be essentially confined within the dissociation front; on the other hand, in the event of horizontal soil fracture formation, the radial extent of dissociation influence zone on soil properties will extend beyond the dissociation front especially for relatively high gas hydrate concentration.Discussion of deep foundation design (tension-leg platform (TLP) piles) in hydrate environment considering effects of hydrate dissociation due to elevated temperature is also presented herein. The potential sediment strength loss and soil loads exerted on the pile resulting from sediment motions induced by fracture growth should be incorporated in the design process.

AB  - AbstractA new experimental set up dedicated to the hydrate dissociation studies is presented. In this new equipment, hydrate dissociation can be achieved by depressurization and/or heating and/or thermodynamic inhibitor injection methods. After a description of the equipment, its capabilities are illustrated by tests with a water + condensate + dispersant additive system. The hydrate formation has been performed in static conditions and closed system. The hydrate formation in the cell is well detected; hydrates form first near the condensate/concentrated emulsion interface. The hydrate was formed essentially with gas dissolved in the condensate phase. Examples of dissociations by depressurization of the cell are presented. The temperature and pressure at different locations of the cell are recorded. The hydrate phase dissociation is clearly highlighted at different points and its impact on the liquid condensate + water and gas phase environment is also seen. The gas and liquids released from the cell are recorded versus time.This experimental set up is a very good tool to form hydrate or hydrate plug in realistic conditions. Here for example tests represent a shut-in in hydrate stability zone. The system offers the possibility of studying both the hydrate formation and all the methods of hydrate dissociation. IntroductionAs offshore production is going on in deeper and deeper water depth, the pressure and temperature in the production facilities are entering deeper and deeper the hydrate stability zone. In these conditions hydrate formation is feared because it will quickly lead to a plug formation and a production shutin. The deferred or loss of production and the possible high cost of a mitigation rig to melt the plug will induce a significant loss of revenue. Regarding these potential problems, hydrate inhibition and control are key issues of new offshore deepwater field development in which hydrate plug formation must be totally avoided (1).When looking at the literature, there is little information on hydrate plug problems and remediation (2, 3). On the other hand, it must be pointed out that experimental researches performed on the hydrate plug dissociation are also limited. Statoil (4) and the NTH (5) worked on gas hydrate plug formation and dissociation during the nineties. More recent works have been performed either in CSM (with ice plug converted into hydrate) (6) or at the Saint Etienne School of Mine on ethane hydrate plug (7).Recently, several articles dealing with hydrate plug dissociation modeling have been published (8-11) and a great effort to improve the models has been made. Hydrate plug dissociation data is and will be needed to test these models and move towards a more accurate and realistic prediction of plug dissociation time. Experimental set upDescriptionThe experimental set up is a 2" internal diameter line of 80 cm length cell. The cell is placed in a temperature controlled chamber (Figure 1). The controlled chamber works in the range of 0 to 60°C. The maximum working pressure of the cell is 150 bars. This cell can accept all non corrosive fluids: water, condensate, crude and solid particles.

AB  - Abstract Technip developed the Electrically Trace Heated Pipe in Pipe (ETH-PiP) technology to overcome some of the challenges associated with deeper and remote offshore oil and gas production. This active heating technology applies power to achieve a production fluid temperature above the hydrate equilibrium or wax appearance temperatures either continuously, during normal production, or intermittently, during shutdown periods. In the unlikely event of hydrate plugging of production lines, active heating can be used for remediation. The objective of this work was to demonstrate that a long, non-permeable hydrate plug can be dissociated in a safe and controlled manner with the ETH-PiP technology. Technip through a JIP program that started in 2012 at the IFPEN facilities at Lyon with Total E&P, ExxonMobil Development Company and Woodside Energy Ltd. have been investigating hydrate dissociation in heated flow lines and studying the associated risks of local pressure build-up and plug run-away. A 6 " OD and 18 m long ETH-PiP prototype was manufactured and connected to the Lyre loop. It was equipped with sensors for accurately monitoring the dissociation process. A first experimental campaign was focused on studying different dissociation heating strategies. A second experimental campaign, presented in this paper, studied hydrate plug dissociation under severe conditions: dissociation in a closed volume; dissociation under high differential pressure; dissociation with unbalanced heating; and dissociation in presence of viscous oil. This paper summarizes the experimental procedures and presents some findings of the second experimental campaign. Massive hydrate plugs of up to 200 kg were formed with high water to hydrate conversion rates. The plugs were characterized under differential pressures of up to 35 bar. The characterizations revealed that pressure communication across hydrate plugs was strongly affected by the presence of free water or oil inside the plug porous structure. Among the dissociation strategies, the dissociation in a closed volume was studied and the pressure management under these conditions was tested.

AB  - Abstract OBC (Ocean Bottom Cable) is a common tool used in the exploration of oil and natural gas fields. But its application to deep sea areas still has to be studied. In this paper we introduce the development of a new 4-conponents monitoring system called ‘DSS' (Deep-sea Seismic System) using multi-component seismic sensors aim to delineate the methane hydrate dissociation zone for the offshore methane hydrate production trial scheduled in FY2012. Back in the year 2006 we developed RSCS (Real-time Seismic Cable System) which was composed of three component gimbaled geophones. The reflection seismic survey trials conducted in the Nankai Trough sea area confirmed the the high quality records that can be obtained with the system. Following the same design concept, we improved the RSCS receiver by reducing its size to 2/3, adopting accelerometers and a hydrophone. The new system was named as ‘DSS'. The receiver case has a protective metallic exterior and the cable is protected with steel-screened armoring, allowing for deployments up to 2,000m water depths and burial using ROV for sub-seabed deployment. This system realizes a unique survey style in which the receivers are left on the seabed between pre-test baseline survey and post-test repeated survey, this interval might be up to 6 months long. The fixed location of the receiver is very important for time-elapsed monitoring surveys. The newly developed DSS, comprising 36 receivers, was deployed and buried on the seabed off the Atsumi Penisnula in August 2012 to conduct a pre-test baseline survey at 1,000m water depths. The pre-test baseline survey was successfully completed and the obtained data was of very high quality. The post-test repeated surveys are planned forApril and August, 2013. Introduction MH21 (Research Consortium for Methane Hydrate Resources in Japan) is planning to carry out the offshore methane hydrate production trial during the FY2012. In this production trial, it is very important to know and understand how the methane hydrate dissociation progresses. The dissociation process progress and changes can be captured only by long-term reflection seismic monitoring which is conducted in intervals as a pre-test survey and a post-test survey, before and after the production trial. The RSCS, developed as a dedicated reflection seismic survey system, was available and its capabilities have been confirmed when we successfully obtained clear BSR (Bottom Simulating Reflector) records during survey trials conducted off Shima cost in 2006. But RSCS receiver size and weight make it very difficult to achieve the requirements for methane hydrate dissociation process monitoring, which requires a receiver interval of 25m at water depths of 1,000m. The estimated cable load was very high and its precise deployment to deep water was too difficult due to the hydrodynamics of the receiver stream. Based on the RSCS design concept, we have developed "DSS?? with a more compact and lighter receiver. We have successfully carried out experimental performance trials off-shore in November 2011, and carried out pre-test survey in August 2012. This paper describes about DSS development and the result of pre-test survey.

AB  - Abstract We seek to quantify the impact of hydrate dissociation on the strength of hydrate-bearing sediments. Dissociation of gas-hydrates in marine sediments converts the solid hydrate structure into liquid water and gas. Together with the associated pore pressure increase, this process reduces the stiffness of the sediments, which may fracture or be fluidized. If sediment failure occurs, seafloor subsidence and landslides can severely damage offshore infrastructure. To evaluate the mechanical properties of a sediment sample, we simulate loading of a disordered pack of spherical grains by incremental displacements of its boundaries. The deformation is described as a sequence of equilibrium configurations. Each configuration is characterized by a minimum of the total potential energy. This minimum is computed using a modification of the conjugate gradient algorithm. We verify our model against published data from experiments on glass beads. Our simulations capture the nonlinear, path-dependent behavior of granular materials observed in experiments. Hydrates are modeled as load-bearing solid particles within the pores. To simulate the consequences of dissociation, we reduce the solid fraction by shrinking the hydrate grains. The effect of the associated excess pore pressure is modeled by isotropic compression of the solid grains, and reduction in macroscopic effective stress. Weakening of the sediment is quantified as a reduction of the effective elastic moduli. Introduction Gas-hydrates are solid materials formed under a range of high pressures and low temperatures. Dissociation converts them into liquid water and free gas. The volumetric expansion of gas can lead to an appreciable increase in pore pressure,1 reducing the effective stress. Thus, dissociation impacts the mechanical properties of hydrate-bearing sediments (HBS) by reducing both the solid fraction and the effective stress. Hydrate dissociation caused, for instance, by hot fluids produced from deep formations, can destabilize the ocean floor and lead to massive landslides1 that can damage nearby structures such as off-shore platforms. On the one hand, obtaining undisturbed HBS samples requires special coring which preserves the in-situ conditions. On the other hand, artificial creation of representative samples is difficult.2 For these reasons, there is no single definitive model for the distribution of hydrates within the pore space.3 This distribution depends on the formation mechanism, along with many other factors.

AB  - ABSTRACTTo determine the critical gas hydrate saturation for the field production test condition, a computational numerical model that reflects the conditions of a mini pressure cell decompression dissociation experiment according to gas hydrate saturation was constructed. The numerical model was verified by comparing and analyzing the experimental and numerical simulation results. Further, the dissociation behavior and gas/water production of various gas hydrate saturation conditions were analyzed. As a result, the critical gas hydrate saturation was determined by changes of gas and water productivity.INTRODUCTIONGas hydrate is formed in solid form by the combining natural gas and water at low temperature and high pressure. The combination of natural gas molecules and water molecules in gas hydrate occurs by the physical bonding of natural gas molecules into the lattice created by water molecules (Lee et al., 2009). Gas hydrate is attracting attention as a source of clean energy because methane (CH4), a major component of gas hydrate, is environmentally friendly in that it reduces the emission of carbon dioxide (CO2) from combustion (Shin et al., 2015).It is present in permafrost and deep ocean sediments (Collett, 2002). It is estimated that approximately 10 trillion tons of gas hydrate are buried around the world (Fig. 1). Korea, Japan, the US, India and other countries that recognized the importance of gas hydrate as future energy source are carrying out national research and development (R&D) programs for gas hydrate (Ryu, 2016). For these gas hydrates to be valued as energy sources, it is necessary to develop a production technology that is stable and economical (Huh and Lee, 2017).It is estimated that 600~800 million tons of gas hydrate could be buried at the Ulleung Basin, East Sea of Korea (Huh, 2005). In 2007, drilling was completed at site UBGH1, along with the first successful acquisition of gas hydrate material in Korea. In 2010, 13 drilling operations were conducted on UBGH2 to evaluate the gas hydrate reserve and to select test production site (Lee et al., 2011). The main properties of the sandy layer containing gas hydrate were estimated based on borehole data (Seo et al., 2010; Shin et al., 2012). Also, a computational numerical model was performed to identify gas hydrate dissociation behavior within the experimental system and to conduct the sensitivity analysis on sediment properties (Gil et al., 2017; Lee et al., 2017). The KIGAM (Korea Institute of Geoscience and Mineral Resources) conducted a study linking the geotechnical numerical analysis to consider the ground stability problem of a field test production candidate site consisting of unconsolidated material (KIGAM, 2010). As such, many studies on the development of gas hydrate in the Ulleung Basin have been conducted. However, problems such as low production, uncertainty of wildcat stability prediction and sand production control have been appeared through the process of designing on-site test production. The test production was postponed to sole problem (Huh and Lee, 2017). Previous research conducted to solve such problem found that the probability of the critical gas hydrate saturation is likely to exist, and the experiments were conducted to determine the critical gas hydrate saturation in field conditions (KIGAM, 2016).

AB  - AbstractHydrate self-preservation property has been reported by some researchers in recent years. So as to test the dissociation rate of hydrates in different temperatures and pressure conditions. The authors conducted laboratory experiments of methane hydrate dissociation in order to examine its potential for application to product natural gas from hydrate. The gas methane's used in this work were artificially prepared using the methane hydrate. Methane hydrate dissociation was measured at atmosphere pressure within temperature range between -7°C and 5°C, and relatively slow dissociation was confirmed at around -5°C. The dissociation rates of the gas hydrates observed can be used to evaluate the gas quantitatively of the hydrate fields, and to safely and eeconomically produce natural gas from hydrates deposits.1. IntroductionGas hydrates are ice-like crystalline materials that contain water and gases with small molecules, which were first observed in the laboratory in 1810 (Chatti, 2005). It was not until nearly 150 years later that they were observed in nature (Link, 2003). Gas hydrates are inclusion compounds composed of water cages that trap guest molecules. It is estimated that over 99% of the guest content is methane (Tulk, 1999). Gas hydrate can form naturally on Earth or as a result of made conditions. Naturally occurring gas hydrate in sediments (permafrost regions and subsea sediments) can be a potential natural gas resource. Natural gas hydrates offer a largely unexploited means of energy recovery and transportation and they could play a significant role in past and future climate changes (Sloan, 2003). One volume of hydrate could release 150 to 180 volumes natural gas at standard conditions (Collett, 1998). Current estimates of the worldwide quantity of hydrocarbon gas hydrates range between 1015 to 1018 m3. Even the most conservative estimates of the total quantity of gas in hydrates may surpass by a factor of two the energy content of the total fuel fossil reserves recoverable by conventional methods (Collett, 2001; Solan, 1998). Thus, developing methods for commercial production of natural gas from hydrates has enormous economical and strategic importance (Ji, 2003).In a recent paper discussing the estimates of worldwide gas hydrate resources, it was argued that there was still no clear cut convergence of estimates over the last twenty years and that the number of estimates is so small that serious doubt can be raised about the inferences drawn from the estimates (Lerche, 2001; Thomas, 2001). Despite the enormous range in reported gas hydrate volumetric estimates, even the lowest estimates seem to indicate that gas hydrates are a greater resource of natural gas than conventional accumulations. The magnitude of this resource could make hydrate reservoirs a substantial future energy resource. While current economic realities do not favor gas production from the hydrate accumulations, their potential clearly demands evaluation. It is important to note, however, than none of these assessments have predicted how much gas compound actually be produced from the world's gas hydrate accumulations.

AB  - Abstract To determine whether ultrasonic wave velocities are affected by the occurrence and amount of methane hydrate in the pore spaces of sediments, we measured ultrasonic velocities in artificial methane hydrate-bearing sandy sediments during the formation and dissociation processes of methane hydrate. An artificial core specimen was made based on the properties of a natural core recovered from a site in the Nankai Trough near Japan. A core holder was used that permitted the independent application of both confining and pore pressures to the artificial core using a rubber sleeve and two syringe pumps. Piezoelectric ceramic sensors were positioned at both end faces of the core and used to oscillate and detect the compressional and shear ultrasonic waves. The formation of methane hydrate, by pressurizing water in the pore spaces of the core sample using methane gas, was associated with an increase in both wave velocities. The increase in ultrasonic velocities was particularly marked at saturations of methane hydrate in the pore spaces above 30% and the maximum velocity of the compressional wave exceeded 3,000 m/s. While ultrasonic wave velocities decreased with the dissociation of methane hydrate due to depressurization or heating, they exhibit hysteresis during formation and dissociation. These findings indicate that the velocities depend on the occurrence of methane hydrate in pore spaces as well as the concentration. Introduction Methane hydrate has considerable potential for use as a new energy resource. Marine methane hydrate occurs in a variety forms several hundred meters below the sea floor. The form considered to be the most well suited to exploitation is that contained within the pore spaces of sandy sediments, as it has relatively larger gas permeability compared to other forms. Since shallow sandy sediments are not usually consolidated, the methane hydrate within pores acts to increase the mechanical strength of the sediments which, consequently, affects production methods. It is thought that methods employing ultrasonic wave velocities are effective for studying the occurrence of interstitial methane hydrate in sandy sediments, and also for undertaking resource assessments of methane hydrate. To determine whether ultrasonic wave velocities are affected by both the occurrence and the amount of interstitial methane hydrate, we measured ultrasonic wave velocities in artificial methane hydrate-bearing sandy sediments during the formation and dissociation of methane hydrate. A resonant column method was developed to study the seismic velocities of methane gas hydrate-bearing sand1,2. Velocities of compressional and shear waves, as well as the dynamic modulus were investigated at methane hydrate saturations below 35%; saturation is defined as the volume ratio of methane hydrate to pore space. Although measurements were performed under dry conditions, the properties under water-saturated conditions were theoretically calculated. The compressional and shear wave velocities increased to 2500 m/s and 1500 m/s at methane hydrate saturation of 35%, respectively. In the present study, ultrasonic wave velocities were measured under water-saturated conditions at methane hydrate saturations of less than 75%. The velocities were also measured at the dissociation of methane hydrate due to depressurization and heating.

AB  - Abstract The potential existence of methane hydrate deposits in the Ulleung Basin of the Korean East Sea was suggested by the Korea Institute of Geoscience and Mineral Resources between 2000 and 2004 and a pilot production project is planned for 2015 as the world's second offshore hydrate production project. The basin has a water depth of 1500-2300 m; however, the depth of the hydrate occurrence zone is relatively shallow (about 100-200 MBSF) for gas hydrate production. There is high potential for geomechanical stability problems such as marine landslides, seafloor subsidence, and wellbore instability. In this study, 2D axisymmetric numerical modeling is conducted to simulate gas hydrate production from the Ulleung basin by depressurization. The simulation incorporates the physical processes of hydrate dissociation, the pore fluid flow and the geomechanical response of hydrate-bearing sediments. During depressurization, deformation of sediments around a production well is generated by the pore pressure difference in the depressurized and dissociation region. This tendency becomes more pronounced due to a stiffness decrease of hydrate-bearing sediments caused by hydrate dissociation.

AB  - Abstract A general formulation for a coupled Thermal-Hydraulic-Mechanical with hydrate Dissociation (THMD) system is developed and applied to sand prediction for conventional gas and gas hydrate bearing sediments (GHBS). Two-phase fluid and conductive heat flow are coupled to an elastoplastic geomechanics model. Series of solutions for simplified models are presented. Fundamental geomechanics behaviors before and after plastic yielding, sanding, and gas hydrate dissociation are defined, discussed, and simulated differently and sanding onset for both conventional gas formations and GHBS are defined by an effective plastic strain (EPS) criterion. The accuracy and reliability of the proposed conventional model are verified by comparing the model prediction with the results of hollow cylinder tests on two different types of sandstone. The advantages of using the EPS over stress-based criteria as an indicator for onset of borehole collapse and sand production are discussed. Introducing a moving gas hydrate dissociation zone (front), the fundamental geomechanics behaviour and elastoplastic deformation of the skeleton formation are highlighted. The effects on sand prediction due to the characteristics of non-linear plastic yielding criteria and gas flow in porous media are also emphasized.

AB  - Abstract This research presents an experimental study of gas production to clarify the dissociation characteristics of depressurization or depressurization with well-wall heating methods. To clarify the dissociation characteristics, we used an artificial core specimen that was produced using the properties of a natural core recovered at a site in the Nankai Trough near Japan. A pressure vessel was used in which confining and pore pressures were applied independently to the artificial core using a rubber sleeve and syringe pumps. Time change of production volume of gas and water, temperature and pressure were measured. The initial experimental parameters were set to simulate the conditions at near Japan sea sediments. The dissociation analysis was evaluated by the overall methane hydrate dissociation rate coefficient that calculated from production gas volume. As a result, the rate constants were increase at the conditions of degree of depressurization or well-wall heating temperature increasing. The overall dissociation rate constant is express as a function of chemical potential and gas volume changes at the production conditions, and its formula is described with a simple form. A heat transfer from ambient area causes the mainly part of chemical potential change. Therefore, the well-wall heating helps methane hydrate dissociation, but the influence is not so large because of its heat transmitting to only small dissociation area. Our result is shown that the gas production rate is a sensitive function of well pressure and temperature. Our equation is verified under the different sensible heat condition experiments. Introduction Methane hydrates are crystalline, ice like compounds of methane gas and water molecules that are formed under certain thermodynamic condition. Methane hydrates in the earth's subsurface within permafrost and sub-sea environments are thought to hold a vast amount of potentially producible natural gas. A number of recovery processes have been suggested for producing gas from hydrates in sediments. Sloan has presented an extensive review of the suggested methods including depressurization, thermal simulation, and inhibitor injection1). In Japan, methane hydrate has also considerable potential for use as a new energy resource. As a production method of natural gas from methane hydrate-bearing layer, depressurization or depressurization with well-wall heating method seems to be effective in economical efficiency. The depressurization method is decreasing the system pressure below the pressure of hydrate formation at a specified temperature. The depressurization with well-wall heating method is combined the thermal simulation method and depressurization method. This method only heats the well wall at the hydrate bearing layer, it is considered that initial and running cost becomes low. Therefore, a number of dissociation data are necessary for the assessment of the efficiency and to establish decomposition method2).

AB  - Abstract Gas hydrates are crystalline, ice-like compounds of gas (e.g., methane) and water molecules that are formed under high pressure and low temperature. Many of the transport properties of porous media containing hydrates are unknown and difficult to measure experimentally. The goal of this work is to match laboratory experiments of hydrate formation and dissociation in cores to estimate some of these transport properties. An implicit, thermal, compositional simulator is used which accounts for four components (hydrate, water, methane and salt) and five phases (hydrate, aqueous, gas, ice, and salt precipitate). The transformation of methane and water to hydrate is modeled by a reaction with the kinetics controlled by the hydrate surface area. The key unknown is the variation of permeability within the core. Permeability and its spatial variation are used as parameters to match the experimental results. Introduction Gas hydrates are ice-like clathrates of gas and water molecules formed under high pressure and low temperature (Sloan, 1998). Methane and water react to form gas hydrates according to the equation:                                                                            (1) where n is the hydration number. Hydrates are formed by gases like methane, ethane and cabon dioxide at hydrate stable pressure and temperature conditions. Three types of crystalline structure, namely structure I (SI), structure II (SII), structure H (SH), in order of increasing size, have been found (Sloan 1998). SI methane hydrate is common in natural deposits. The large amount of gas hydrates present in the earth's crust can be a potential source of energy or a potential hazard if the gas hydrate dissociate due to global warming and methane gas leaks in the atmosphere.  Finding an efficient and safe method of producing natural gas from hydrate deposits is important commercially. Four methods and their combinations have been proposed to produce gas from hydrate reservoirs: depressurization, thermal stimulation, inhibitor injection, and CO2 injection (Makogon, 1997; Ji et al., 2001; Graue et al., 2006). Simulation models are needed to find efficient ways of producing natural gas from hydrate deposits. Different numerical models have been proposed to estimate the gas production from hydrate reservoirs (Tsypkin, 1991; Ji et al., 2001; Moridis, 2002; Sun & Mohanty 2006). In analytical model by Ji et al. (2001), the mobility of the water phase is ignored. The analytical model by Tsypkin (1991) takes into account the flow of water, but it assumes a fixed relative permeability for each phase. These analytical models assume equilibrium decomposition, i.e, hydrate is assumed to dissociate instantaneously once the equilibrium condition is reached. Numerical models take into account multiphase flow, heat transfer and hydrate kinetics. The knowledge of transport properties and kinetics in porous media is necessary to build an accurate simulator for gas production from hydrate reservoir. Geological formation model of methane hydrate in marine sediments have been proposed by Xu and Ruppel (1999) and Rempel and Buffett (1997). Bhatnagar et al. (2006) have developed generalized 1-D model for hydrate saturation applicable to different geological settings.

AB  - Abstract Formation of gas hydrates in oil and gas production systems constitutes a major flow assurance challenge and the consequences to the smooth production operation could be catastrophic. Recently, there is a shift of focus from total hydrate prevention to risk management which is more economical with reduced storage and injection facilities. Therefore, we have formulated two novel imidazolium-based Ionic Liquids (IM-based ILs) for thermodynamic methane hydrate inhibition. Heating, insulation, and addition of thermodynamic or kinetic inhibitors are strategies to prevent hydrate formation. The COnductor-like Screening MOdel for Realistic Solvents (COSMO-RS) was used to screen and rank several potential IM-based ILs based on their hydrogen bonding energies. 1-ethyl-3-methylimidazolium glutamate (EMIM-GMT), 1-butyl-3-methylimidazolium glutamate (BMIM-GMT) and 1-(3-cyanopropyl)-3-methylimidazolium glutamate (CPMIM-GMT) with hydrogen bonding energies of −62.01 KJ/mol, −61.46 KJ/mol and −67.21KJ/mol respectively were selected and synthesised for performance evaluation. Methane gas of 99.995% purity was used with deionised water to conduct thermodynamic dissociation tests using the SETARAM micro-Differential calorimetry (μDSC 7 Evo-1A). The μDSC was calibrated by comparing the offset dissociation temperature data of deionised water with published data from the literature. Thereafter, the dissociation profiles were obtained at pressures 30, 50, 75, 100, 125, and 150 bars. Results show that for 0.1wt% of the three IM-based ILs, the dissociation temperature increases with pressure and a good thermodynamic inhibition with temperature shift in the range from 0.87 to 1.14°C was observed. The EMIM-GMT achieved the highest geometric average temperature shift of 1.14°C while the CPMIM-GMT and BMIM-GMT shifted the hydrate dissociation envelop by 0.91°C and 0.87°C respectively. Thus, the thermodynamic inhibition performance of EMIM-GMT is better than most of the current EMIM- and BMIM- Halide groups of IM-based ILs with the individual and combined average shift of less than 1.0°C. In this study, we have shown that the effectiveness of an IM-based IL as a thermodynamic methane hydrate inhibitor is largely a function of its hydrogen bonding energy between the water molecule and the IL ions. The relative order of performance of the three IM-based glutamate ILs is EMIM > CPMIM > BMIM.

AB  - This paper presents a model for natural gas hydrate dissociation from the methane hydrate reservoir by depressurization or temperaturefalling of the well. In this model, the controlling equations are consisted of quality conservation, momentum equilibrium and energy conservation equations. Four media: Free methane (gas), methane hydrate (solid), rock skeleton, and water (liquid) are in thermodynamic equilibrium. The heat suction by the dissociation and the convectionconduction are considered also. The geological formation is assumed to be uniform and the flow of free methane is regarded as flow through a porous media with porosity. It is shown that the dissociation rate increases with the increase of depressurization and the increase of initial saturation of gas hydrate and degrades fast with the distance from the boundary. The changes of the pressure on the boundary have large effects on the dissipation of the pore pressure. The changes of the heat conductivity have little effects on the dissociation of gas hydrate and the dissipation of pore pressure. INTRODUCTION Hydrate is treated as a potential energy resource for the 21st century because a large amount of methane gas is trapped in hydrate reservoirs. In the past 30 years, considerable effort has been made for commercial production of natural gas from hydrate reservoirs. Until now, all methods are still limited to experimental scale, except for one gashydrate field in western Siberia, which was exploited successfully (Makogon,1997). To recover natural gas from hydrate dissociation, depressurization or temperature falling are effective methods which are based on breaking the temperature-pressure equilibrium conditions of gas hydrate. Extensive reviews of gas hydrate were reported by Englezos (1993). Makogon (1997) and Sloan (1998), Burshears et al. (1986), Selim and Sloan (1989), Tsypkin (2000), Masuda et al. (1999) presented different methods for analysis of the dissociation process of gas hydrate by depressurization.

AB  - Abstract Studies presented in [1] show that during gas production from the fields located in the permafrost regions intensive hydrate formation occurs in the bottom-hole zone. The process begins from the moment of bringing well into production, and approximately in 100 days all free water transforms into a hydrate. As a result, well productivity within this period reduces to about 20%. One of the ways of well productivity recovery is the use of different types of heaters. The paper presents theevaluation of the above method efficiency. To study the dynamics of hydrate formation and dissociation the modified mathematical model proposed in [1] has been used. During the computational experiment the effect of heating intensity, gas well production rate and permeability of gas-bearing reservoir on dynamics of the formation and dissociation of natural gas hydrates has been studied. The results of calculations for the intensive heating show that regardless of the distance from a well, rate of hydrate saturation growth and its absolute magnitude significantly depend on permeability and production rate and that hydrate formation occurs in a comparatively narrow zone near wells where all pore water transforms into a hydrate. But this hydrate-free zone is stable during successive gas extraction for a long time. If the heater temperature only slightly exceeds the equilibrium temperature of hydrate formation but its active period is much longer, then its influence is more localized than in the first variant. Moreover, here the size of the hydrate-free zone depends both on gas flow rate and bed permeability. Introduction Studies presented in papers [1,2] have shown that during gas production from the permafrost zone fields the intensive hydrate formation occurs in the bottom hole zone of a well. The above process initiates from the moment a well is brought into production, and approximately in 100 days all free water transfers into a hydrate. As a result, well productivity decreases by about 20% during this period. At some distance from the bottom hole zone hydrate saturation non-monotonically depends both on time and radial coordinate. Moreover, this tendency is more pronounced during gas extraction at constant bottom-hole pressure. Similar behavior is observed for water saturation, and the latter becomes higher in the distant zone of the bed as compared with its initial value. The above effect can be explained by the fact that at a large distance from a well, hydrate saturation lowers with time that brings about the excess free water, which remains stationary due to the character of phase permeability dependence on water saturation. When gas is extracted at a constant production rate the curves of the change in the bottom hole pressure have two typical rectilinear sections, the first of which is characterized by a comparatively small pressure drop and, accordingly, slight decrease of well productivity. Then pressure drops abruptly that indicates the completion of hydrate formation and considerable decrease in well productivity.  One way to recover well productivity is the use of different types of heaters. The paper presents the estimation of the efficiency of the above method.

AB  - Gas hydrates (naturally occurring ice-like combinations of gas and water have the potential to provide an immense source of natural gas from the world?s oceans and polar regions. However, the technical challenges of economically producing gas from hydrates are substantial. Proposed recovery methods such as dissociating or melting gas hydrates by heating and/or depressurizing the reservoir are currently being tested. One such test was conducted recently in northern Canada by the partners in the Mallik 2002 Research Well Program.Before the test, the Mallik 5L-38 well was cored, and gas hydrates and associated sediments were recovered for study. An extensive geophysics research program was also launched, which included seismic and advanced well log studies. A 5-day thermal test was then conducted within a 13-m interval of highly concentrated gas hydrates. The well was cased and a pipe circulating hot water was landed to the base of the perforated test section. The heating of the formation caused the hydrate to dissociate into water and natural gas, with the dissociated gas expanding into the wellbore. The amount of gas produced at the surface was monitored using gauges.Resistivity logs were used to answer the important question of how deeply the hydrate dissociation extended into the formation. The open hole logging suite run prior to the thermal test included array induction, array laterolog, nuclear magnetic resonance, and 1.1-GHz electromagnetic propagation logs, as well as resistivity images. The reservoir saturation tool was run both before and after the thermal test to monitor formation changes. A cased hole formation resistivity log was run after the test.The radius of dissociation as a function of depth was determined by means of iterative forward modeling of cased hole formation resistivity response. Pretest baseline resistivity values in each formation layer (Rt were established from the deep induction and laterolog curves. The resistivity in the region of hydrate dissociation near the wellbore (Rxo was determined from electromagnetic propagation and reservoir saturation tool measurements. The dissociation radius was systematically increased in each layer, and cased hole formation resistivity tool response was iteratively modeled with a finite element code. A solution for the dissociation radius in each layer was obtained when the modeled log overlaid the field log.Pretest production computer simulations predicted that dissociation should take place at a constant radius. However, the post-test resistivity modeling showed that this was not the case. The resistivity-derived dissociation radius was greatest near the outlet of the circulating pipe, where the highest temperatures were recorded. The radius was smallest near the center of the test interval, where a conglomerate section with lower porosities and permeabilities appears to have inhibited dissociation. The free gas volume calculated using the resistivity-derived dissociation radii yielded a value within 20% of the surface gauge measurements. These results indicate that most of the produced gas was actually measured, and that resistivity modeling and inversion show promise for future use in gas hydrate monitoring.

AB  - ABSTRACTPermeability is critical for gas production from the methane hydrate sediment and spatial distribution of hydrate saturation during hydrate dissociation via depressurization around quadruple point especially. The numerical model of hydrate dissociation coupling ice formation kinetics was developed and verified by comparing and analyzing the experimental and simulation results. Further, the spatial distribution of hydrate saturation and gas production performance were investigated. As a result, depressurization below quadruple point, the extent of hydrate saturation dissociation around the perforation of well are enhanced with the decreasing permeability at the same degree of hydrate dissociation while the differences in the out wall are not clear. The spatial distributions of hydrate saturation present the uniform mode rather than a sharp dissociation front as in cases of ice generation. A higher reservoir permeability resulted in an earlier peak gas generation time and a higher peak gas generation rate. Ice would generate and release additional heat for hydrate dissociation especially in the condition of adiabatic boundary.INTRODUCTIONGas hydrates are ice-like crystalline compounds in which solid lattices of water molecules accommodate gas molecules in a cage-like structure or clathrate (Demirbas, 2010). Since MH is a solid material without mobility, it is necessary to dissociate MH to methane gas and water in site for gas recovery. MH is expected as one of the new energy resources in the future, because the amount of hydrocarbon resources in MH are larger than total amount of oil, natural gas and coal resources worldwide (Makogon,1982; Milkov, 2004; Koh, 2009). The dissociation methods are classified into depressurization, thermal stimulation, and inhibitor injection (Sloan, 1990).Hydrate dissociation is a complicated process, incorporating heat transfer, fluid flow, and hydrate dissociation kinetics (Sun, 2006). In addition, numerous laboratory-scale experiments and simulations have been undertaken to investigate the effects of heat transfer on hydrate dissociation both by depressurization alone and in combination with thermal stimulation (Tang, 2007; Wang, 2016). For hydrate dissociation induced by depressurization, the deep depressurization below the quadruple point could be an enhanced method for gas production and more gas recovery in a most huge instrument (Konno, 2014). The same result is found in a large experiment by (Wang, 2016). On the other hand, depressurization below the quadruple point would induce ice generation which could block the flow channel in porous media (Moridis, 2009). A three dimensions numerical model is developed to simulate hydrate dissociation behavior by (Bai, 2009), and the formation of ice influence gas production severely.

AB  - Summary This paper describes the first uniform formation of natural gas hydrates in Berea sandstone cores by use of a flow system. The hydrate formation was monitored by pressure drop and changes in electric resistance along three cores of three different permeabilities. Formation procedures, such as annealing to ensure uniformity, and the effects of surfaces on equilibria are discussed. Hydrates were dissociated through depressurization, as is done for gas recovery from the Messoyakha hydrate reservoir in the USSR. During the dissociation, two types of rate behavior were observed as functions of the displacement of the dissociation pressure from the equilibrium value. Conclusions and implications for the production of natural gases from hydrate deposits are discussed. Introduction Natural gas hydrates are inclusion compounds in which certain-molecular-weight gases stabilize the cages formed by hydrogen-bonded water molecules under favorable conditions of pressure and temperature. X-ray diffraction studies1 have shown that small molecules of nonpolar gases can stabilize either of two specific structures called Structures I and II. Fig. 1 shows a unit cell of each structure. A unit cell of Structure I contains eight cavities (two small and six large) and is formed by 46 hydrogen-bonded water molecules, while a unit cell of Structure II contains 136 water molecules and encloses 24 cavities (16 small and 8 large). At maximum occupancy (each cavity is filled with one gas guest molecule), 1 mol of hydrate of either structure yields about 0.15 mol gas and 0.85 mol water. The molecules of such gases as methane, ethane, propane, isobutene, CO2, H2S, and N2 are known to stabilize the microcavities formed by either of the two hydrate structures. The formation of either Structure I Structure II is related to the ratio of the guest molecule size to the cavity size and to the thermodynamic conditions of temperature, pressure, and gas composition. A more comprehensive exposition of hydrates and their structures may be found elsewhere.2 Gas hydrates were considered nuisances for the gas industry since Hammerschmidt's3 discovery that hydrate formation causes plugging of gas pipelines. Following discoveries of substantial gas hydrate deposits in the USSR4 and in the Canadian permafrost,5 however, gas hydrates began to receive attention as a potential energy resource. Bearing in mind that 1 m3 of PV filled with hydrate can yield a maximum of 184 std m3 of gas, substantial amounts of gas could be produced from these hydrate deposits. Makogon6 and Kvenvolden7 independently estimated the amount of hydrated gas to be two orders of magnitude greater than the current proved natural gas reserves in the world. The only reported production of a gas hydrate field is that from the Messoyakha field6 in the USSR. Verma et al.8 found that gas hydrates can also form from water/liquid-hydrocarbon mixtures. It is believed9 that hydrate formation has caused some North Slope oil deposits to increase in gravity and viscosity by stripping the light components (CH4 to C4H10) of these oils in a process called denuding. Several studies10-14 have been made to simulate natural gas hydrate formation in nature and to investigate possible schemes to produce these deposits. Previous laboratory attempts,15-17 however, have shown little success at quantifying uniform hydrate formation and dissociation in consolidated porous media. The objectives of this work were to form methane gas hydrates in Berea sandstone core samples and to measure the dissociation rate of such hydrates at constant pressure and temperature in an attempt to simulate gas hydrate production by a slow depressurization process. Experimental Apparatus and Procedure Fig. 2 is a diagram of the apparatus used for hydrate formation and dissociation in Berea sandstone core samples. The core was enclosed with heat-shrink plastic tubing and contained within a stainless-steel pressure sample bomb. An external pressure, which was a minimum of 1 MPa greater than that within the core, was maintained on the outside of the heat-shrink tubing with a manual hydraulic pump. The electric resistance was measured with four pairs of electrodes implanted at equal distances along the core length under the heat-shrink tubing, as shown in Fig. 3. In addition to pressure drop, measurement of the electric resistances provided another method to check for both the amount and uniformity of hydrate formation. Data acquisition was accomplished with a Kiethley-500™ series system connected to an IBM-XT™ personal computer. Ref. 18 gives a more detailed description of the apparatus. Experimental Procedure. The core sample was initially evacuated and saturated with 1.5 wt% NaCl solution. Then, several PV's of brine solution were circulated under high pressure through the core to ensure full saturation and stability. Later, gas injection began at the experimental pressure (7 to 8 MPa) and temperature (273.7 K). Gas injection continued until the desired water and gas saturations were established in the core. The produced water and gas volumes were closely monitored during this step. The outlet valve was then closed, and gas injection was maintained during hydrate formation; when no more gas uptake was possible, the inlet valve was closed. At this stage, the bath temperature was maintained at 273.7 K to allow hydrate formation to continue at a pressure always in excess of the equilibrium value for a period of 4 to 34 hours. When no change in the pressure and electric resistance with time was observed, the hydrate formation was assumed to have ceased. In many instances, especially with the lower-permeability cores, a pressure drop of up to 2.8 MPa across the core was detected after the hydrate was formed. Then, one or more cycles of an annealing process were performed to eliminate this pressure drop and to ensure more uniform hydrate distribution along the core. In the annealing process, hydrate was dissociated and reformed by cycles of heating (to 279.8 K) and cooling (to 273.7 K) the core. After hydrate formation, dissociation began at constant outlet pressure and bath temperature. The rate of gas produced during this step was measured by water displacement into a graduated cylinder over 1-minute intervals. At the end of the dissociation process, the amount of water produced during this step was determined.   Experimental Procedure.

AB  - Abstract Due to its increasing abundance, cleaner and lower emissions upon combustion, natural gas (NG) has been considered as the best transition fuel away from coal and oil to a carbon-constrained world. Methane gas is the major component in NG accounting for 70-90%, and is also the major constituent found in natural gas hydrates (NGHs). The amount of CH4 preserved in NGHs is vast and estimated to be 20,000 trillion cubic meter (TCM) worldwide. This outweighs the proved NG reserve on earth, which is 865.4 TCM, and doubles the combined reserve of all fossil fuels. Thus, NGHs have been considered as a potential future energy source. Extensive geological surveys and drilling programs have been carried out during the past two decades at various countries (Canada, USA, Japan, S. Korea, India, China, etc.) to identify the location of these NGH reservoirs, to quantify the amount of gas deposited and to recover hydrate cores to analyze their thermophysical and geomechanical properties. Extensive research have also been carried out in laboratories to synthesis gas hydrate mimicking marine and permafrost conditions, and to study their fundamental behavior of formation and dissociation. In this study, we numerically analyzed an experiment of methane hydrate bearing sediment (P = 6.2 MPa) with hydrate saturation SH = 40% dissociation process induced by depressurization (P = 4 MPa) in a 1.0 L reactor with the production of water and gas. The simulation-predicted cumulative gas production shows an excellent agreement with the experimental measurement. In addition, from the evolution of phase saturation over time, it is revealed that hydrate dissociates from outer boundary to inner core. In addition, methane gas migrates to the reactor outer boundary first and accumulates to the upper section of the reactor mainly due to buoyance effect, while water drains down to the bottom of the reactor due to gravity. The parametric study on the fulids and thermal transport parameters (absolute permeability, k and HBS composite thermal conductivity, kθ) and the kinetic parameter (K°) concluded that the gas production process is predominated controlled by thermal and kinetic reaction paramters, while flow paramters does not play a significant role in the current smallscale reactor.

AB  - Abstract The world-first offshore production test of gas hydrate was just performed in the deep water Nankai Trough along the Pacific coast of Japan in March, 2013. A week-long flow test successfully produced methane gas by depressurizing method from the subsea methane hydrate reservoir. While methane gas was successfully extracted from natural hydrate, there is a strong urge for understanding the dissociation behavior and characterizing production process of hydrate through the depressurization method. This is a crucial knowledge for the future commercial production of gas hydrate. The dissociation of methane hydrate is an endothermic reaction, and the drop of formation temperature is expected to occur as the dissociation progresses. By capturing the phenomenon of temperature decrease in-situ, the data attributed to the dissociation of methane hydrate can be obtained during production. Two monitoring wells, uniquely designed for minimizing thermal disturbance and better thermal coupling were drilled in the vicinity of the production well, and the two types of temperature sensors using DTS (Distributed Temperature Sensing) and array-type RTD (Resistance Temperature Detector) were deployed in the monitoring wells and recorded the data not only during the flow test period but also before and after the test. DTS covered the entire wellbore interval while the array-type RTD sensors were strategically placed across the gas hydrate reservoir with higher temperature resolution and accuracy. In both monitoring wells, the temperature decreases were observed distinctively with both sensors as the flow test progressed over a week. The data quality check confirmed both measurements were conformable to the design specification and demonstrated the strong advantages of having both sensors in this monitoring system for further interpretation to investigate the dissociation behaviors. The framework for temperature data analysis was defined to perform thermal characterization of gas hydrate reservoir during the production test stage. The preliminary analysis on the temperature transients was performed, and the results that could explain the dissociation behaviors were obtained.

AB  - Natural gas hydrates exist in geological formations and constitute a potentially large natural gas resource for the future. To recover natural gas from hydrates, these must be dissociated in situ. At the present stage, the depressurization method is expected to be a main dissociation procedure. In this study, the inhibitor injection method or steam injection method combined with depressurization, and inhibitor injection with a higher methanol concentration, have been examined using laboratory-made methane hydrate-bearing sediment. Comparison with other methods made it clear that the combined method contributed the fastest gas production rate. The advantages of the combined method become remarkable at a higher pressure condition (smaller depressurization from initial pressure). The production rate of the combined method becomes faster as the pressure is lower. In the case of a high concentration injection, it becomes clear that the higher inhibitor concentration effectively contributes to the faster gas production rate, and a significant dilution of methanol by pure water from hydrate dissociation was observed, compared to the lower concentration case. INTRODUCTIONNatural gas hydrates are crystalline compounds that can contain a large amount of natural gas (Sloan, 1998). Owing to recent seismic exploration and geological research, it is widely known that the natural gas hydrate that exists in the sediment constitutes a large natural gas resource and is expected to be an energy source in the future (Makogon, 1981; Brooks et al., 1986; Kvenvolden, 1988; Kvenvolden et al., 1993; Okuda, 1993; Gornitz and Fung, 1994; Sassen, 2001). To recover natural gas from commercially viable hydrates, hydrates must be dissociated in situ. Also, there is a demand to enhance the recovery ratio of natural gas. The authors had investigated the inhibitor injection method and steam injection method for accelerated methane hydrate dissociation (Kawamura et al., 2006a, b, 2007, 2008 a, b).

AB  - Abstract Hydrate formation in production and control lines has been a serious issue in the oil industry, especially in the deepwater offshore market. This article focuses on a compact temporary plant designed to be assembled on offshore rigs for heating and injecting high flow rate water to break hydrates. Hydrates are formed under determined conditions (high pressure at low temperature) in which natural gas hydrocarbon molecules are trapped in ice molecules, forming crystal structures and plugging or choking lines, causing operational problems. When preventive solutions, such as chemical inhibitors or thermal insulation, do not work, the formed hydrate must be broken or dissociated to set the lines free. One option is active heating, in which hot fluid is circulated to increase the temperature and break the hydrate ice structures. Consequently, a compact plant, with combined direct and indirect heating, was designed to deliver a customized solution for an offshore rig. Drill or salt water pumps were used to supply cold water at 12 bpm at 25 °C, and two steam generators were used to inject steam into the flow, mixing inline and delivering water at 49 °C at the mud tanks. This tank water was pumped through mud pumps at 12 bpm, passing through four steam heat exchangers (SHE) to deliver water at a final temperature of 90 °C. The total process used six steam generators and four SHE to heat water from 25 to 90 °C at 12 bpm. The compact design for the high flow rate injection plant was only possible with combined and independent processes. Direct heating by steam injection was used inline downstream from the drill water pump to preheat the water to 49 °C while feeding the mud tank. Indirect heating used four SHE downstream of the mud pump to deliver water at 90 °C at the seabed.

In order to make recovery of natural gas from hydrates commercially viable, hydrates must be dissociated in-situ. Inhibitor injection method is thought to be one of the effective dissociation method as well as depressurization and thermal stimulation. But there is only limited information about dissociation kinetics in inhibitors, while there exist substantial phase equilibrium data. In our previous study, the dissociation behavior of a hydrate core sample in inhibitor aqueous solution (i.e. methanol aqueous solution) had been investigated using an experimental set-up equipped with core holder. In this study, the experimental set-up was developed to achieve the scale-up experiment and the precise thermal analysis. The length of the core holder was extended to 5 times longer to reproduce the thermal gradient in the core. Using the apparatus, warm pure water was injected through the core samples, which imitate natural gas hydrate sediment under seafloor. . Two kinds of experiments were presented in this paper. And another was that without using it for comparison. From these results the advantage of the temperature gradient system became clear.

AB  - The phenomenon of reforming methane hydrate was analyzed experimentally under dissociation process. The authors investigated how temperature and salinity of injected brine, and a hot-brine injection coupled with depressurization affect methane hydrate reformation during dissociation. An experimental apparatus was constructed to dissociate the hydrate, that was to inject hot-brine water into an artificial hydrate-bearing sand column. The reformation area could be recognized where internal pressure increased sharply. Salinity was the most important factor to prevent hydrate reformation while temperature played a minor role. A hot-brine injection followed after depressurization was more effective in inhibiting the hydrate reformation rather than the inverse case. INTRODUCTION Methane hydrate, one kind of gas clathrates is naturally composed of water molecules forming a rigid lattice of cages with most of the cages each containing a molecule of natural gas, mainly methane. It has been expected as one of unconventional but alternative energy resources. The environment found both oceanic sediments and permafrost regions can promote the formation of gas hydrates, where low temperature and/or high pressure prevail. It requires to dissociate hydrate into gas and water phases to recover methane from hydrates. The dissociation occurs if the equilibrium condition is broken by heat stimulation, depressurization, hydrate inhibitor injection, and any combination of the aforementioned methods. It has been known that hot-brine injection among them might be effective due to the association of heat and salt as inhibitor. It is essential to inject brine continuously in hot-brine injection. However, if additional hydrate growth, as it is called hydrate reformation, occurs due to migration of water and dissociated gas during continuous injection, the efficiency would be decreased. To prevent the reformation is one of key factors on planning the production facilities. Sakamoto et al.(2007a, 2007b) analyzed experimentally the methane hydrate dissociation by hot-water injection according to temperature of injected water, reservoir pressure and hydrate saturation and observed the hydrate reformation.

AB  - AbstractFinite volume method with unstructured mesh were constructed in a 3D, porous media by assuming the media spherical type. For the convection–diffusion equations for momentum, mass, and temperature, a third-order up-winding scheme and a second-order central differencing scheme were adopted to approximate the convection and the diffusion terms in non-equilibrium state, respectively. The time differential terms were discretized by a second-order explicit scheme. The original code was developed by Jung and Sato (2005). At the surface of MH, the model reported by Sean and Sato (2007) has been employed. The overall scheme of CFD has been examined in determining the intrinsic dissociation rate of methane and CO2 hydrate. In this study, one regular and face-centered cubic arrays with surface dissociation model attached were shown to simulate the hydrate dissociated in homogeneous porous media. The relative dissociation rates in two cases were evaluated and compared to the existing experimental results. Our 3D finite-volume model scheme has been demonstrated to be a simple tool for prediction of hydrate dissociation in porous media, and could be used to determine some complex phenomena occurred in sediments that are coupled with velocity, mass and heat transfer, or the mechanical stress.

AB  - ABSTRACT:Gas hydrate is one of the new energy resources because of vast amount of reservoirs in marine sediments. Recently, research and developments for the gas hydrate production have been conducted in some countries. To evaluate the production from the reservoirs, it is necessary to understand the behavior of dissociation in-situ condition. However, the rate of dissociation of gas hydrate has been unknown, especially in the situation of pore space of marine sediments. In this paper, the rate of dissociation of methane hydrates occupied in pore space is discussed. Based on the microscopic observation using Raman spectrometer, the mechanism of dissociation in pore space has been clarified. The rates of gas hydrate dissociation were measured under various unstable conditions, such as pressure decrease and heat stimulation. Dissociation model to simulate the interaction between hydrate crystals and pore space was considered on the basis of the experimental results. Through the above discussion, the estimation method for dissociation rate of methane hydrates was developed and validated. The simulation results using the developed model agree well with the data obtained from bulk-scale experiments. INTRODUCTIONMethane hydrate is ice-like solid substance in which water molecule structure contains embedded methane molecules under low-temperature and high-pressure conditions. Three major extraction methods of gas hydrates from the reservoir in marine sediments has been proposed, such as depressurization, thermal stimulation and inhibitor injection. These are all based on the in-situ dissociation process of gas hydrates that is transformed into methane gas and water. Fig.1 shows the production image for gas hydrates from marine sediments. Only methane gas can be produced from the reservoirs in marine sediments. To evaluate the productivity of methane gas from the reservoirs, it is necessary to understand the phenomena of dissociation and to estimate the rate of dissociation in the environment of marine sediments.

Abstract Studies presented in [1] show that during gas production from the fields located in the permafrost regions intensive hydrate formation occurs in the bottom-hole zone. The process begins from the moment of bringing well into production, and approximately in 100 days all free water transforms into a hydrate. As a result, well productivity within this period reduces to about 20%. One of the ways of well productivity recovery is the use of different types of heaters. The paper presents theevaluation of the above method efficiency. To study the dynamics of hydrate formation and dissociation the modified mathematical model proposed in [1] has been used. During the computational experiment the effect of heating intensity, gas well production rate and permeability of gas-bearing reservoir on dynamics of the formation and dissociation of natural gas hydrates has been studied. The results of calculations for the intensive heating show that regardless of the distance from a well, rate of hydrate saturation growth and its absolute magnitude significantly depend on permeability and production rate and that hydrate formation occurs in a comparatively narrow zone near wells where all pore water transforms into a hydrate. But this hydrate-free zone is stable during successive gas extraction for a long time. If the heater temperature only slightly exceeds the equilibrium temperature of hydrate formation but its active period is much longer, then its influence is more localized than in the first variant. Moreover, here the size of the hydrate-free zone depends both on gas flow rate and bed permeability. Introduction Studies presented in papers [1,2] have shown that during gas production from the permafrost zone fields the intensive hydrate formation occurs in the bottom hole zone of a well. The above process initiates from the moment a well is brought into production, and approximately in 100 days all free water transfers into a hydrate. As a result, well productivity decreases by about 20% during this period. At some distance from the bottom hole zone hydrate saturation non-monotonically depends both on time and radial coordinate. Moreover, this tendency is more pronounced during gas extraction at constant bottom-hole pressure. Similar behavior is observed for water saturation, and the latter becomes higher in the distant zone of the bed as compared with its initial value. The above effect can be explained by the fact that at a large distance from a well, hydrate saturation lowers with time that brings about the excess free water, which remains stationary due to the character of phase permeability dependence on water saturation. When gas is extracted at a constant production rate the curves of the change in the bottom hole pressure have two typical rectilinear sections, the first of which is characterized by a comparatively small pressure drop and, accordingly, slight decrease of well productivity. Then pressure drops abruptly that indicates the completion of hydrate formation and considerable decrease in well productivity.  One way to recover well productivity is the use of different types of heaters. The paper presents the estimation of the efficiency of the above method.

AB  - This article, written by JPT Technology Editor Chris Carpenter, contains highlights of paper OTC 28905, “Advances in LHDIs and Applications,” by Y.D. Chin and A. Srivastava, Subsea Engineering Technologies, prepared for the 2018 Offshore Technology Conference, Houston, 30 April–3 May. The paper has not been peer reviewed. Copyright 2018 Offshore Technology Conference. Reproduced by permission. This paper summarizes historical advancements in low-dosage hydrate inhibitors (LDHIs) over the past 2 decades, discusses their advantages and limitations, and their selection criteria. Historically, hydrate risk has been managed by keeping fluids warm, removing water, or injecting thermodynamic hydrate inhibitors (THIs), commonly methanol (MeOH) or monoethylene glycol (MEG). THIs require high dosage rates; therefore, that technique can pose limitations to production systems in the form of supply, storage, and umbilical-injection constraints. Additionally, high dosages of MeOH can cause crude contamination for downstream refineries. LDHIs continue to offer significant efficiency and cost benefits over other techniques. Introduction THIs have long been used by the industry because of their ability to shift the hydrate-equilibrium curve toward higher pressures and lower temperatures by changing the activity of water molecules. MeOH and MEG have proved the most popular types of THI because of their low cost and widespread availability. Though THIs are low-cost, the volume requirement per barrel offsets the cost benefit. A group of chemicals developed later, LDHIs, differ from THIs because they do not shift the hydrate curve; rather, they interfere with the process of hydrate formation through different mechanisms. The dosage requirement of these inhibitors is much lower than that required for THIs. LDHIs include two categories, kinetic hydrate inhibitors (KHIs) and antiagglomerants (AAs). KHIs increase the induction time for hydrate formation by interfering with the nucleation process or the crystal-growth process. Special surfactants disperse hydrate particles as they form, reducing the tendency of hydrates to stick to the pipe’s inner surface, reducing the chance of plug formation. AAs modify the agglomeration of hydrate particles, decreasing hydrate-crystal size by affecting hydrate morphology. This leads to a hydrate slurry flow, which decreases the chance of pipeline blockage. Inhibition mechanisms of both KHIs and AAs are discussed in detail in the complete paper, as is the historical development of these LDHIs. LDHI Applications Performance Parameters. The two primary parameters for LDHI performance measurement include the following: Hold Time. This is defined as the time between when a rapidly cooled fluid is at a constant temperature below the hydrate-equilibrium temperature and when hydrates first appear. For KHIs, the hold time decreases steeply with the increase in subcooling. Dosage Rates. To establish actual dosage rates for a LDHI in a specific fluid, technical-feasibility testing would be required with the actual LDHI and fluid under actual pressure and temperature conditions. An approximate range of expected LDHI dosage rates can be given as examples as follows. Gas System. For a gas system operating with condensed water, the dosage-rate guideline is 5 gal LDHI/bbl of condensed water. Breakthrough of formation water with a saline content of at least 3 wt% would reduce the rate to between 0.5 and 1.0 gal LDHI/bbl of formation water, although it should be recognized that this would be a different LDHI from the one used with condensed water.

AB  - AbstractMost of the world's resources of hydrocarbons energy remain in the form of methane hydrates or clathrates. These exist naturally as frozen crystalline lattice consisting of molecules of water that have formed an open, cage-like lattice that encloses molecules of methane. For example, if one percent of the methane hydrates deposits in the Gulf of Mexico were to be commercially drillable and produce able, the United States would not be dependent upon foreign imports of oil and gas for the foreseeable future. However, and it must be mentioned early on, methane hydrates present a litany of drilling-related challenges to the conventional methods. To a great degree, this explains why there have been only a few attempts to drill for commercial quantities. Much has been discussed and learned about where methane hydrates of "commercial quantities" are located, reservoir thickness and depth, etc. Commercial quantities have been quantified onshore typically in artic permafrost regions and offshore on the slopes of continental shelves where pressure and temperatures are suitable and methane and water co-exist. Scientific expeditions such as those conducted by the Integrated Offshore Drilling Program (Texas A&M) have extensively mapped and quantified huge deposits, globally. However, little has been written about technologies that exist that appear to have unique potential to enable the safe and effective drilling and production of commercial quantities. In addition to hydrates being only quasi-stable, the crystalline structure packs methane so efficiently, depending upon the purity of the hydrate, it can contain between 70 and 164 times the volume of free gas at standard temperature and pressure vs. the volume of the hydrate prior to dissociation. Because hydrates will dissociate or release free gas upon a decrease of pressure, increase of temperature, or combinations thereof, premature dissociation around the wellbore and within annulus returns to the surface must be avoided during the drilling process. A primary purpose of this paper is to suggest that Managed Pressure Drilling (MPD) technology may be uniquely applicable to the successful drilling for commercial quantities. "MPD is an adaptive drilling process used to more precisely control the annular pressure profile throughout the wellbore. The objectives are to ascertain the downhole pressure environment limits and to manage the annular hydraulic pressure profile accordingly." Add to this IADC definition of Managed Pressure Drilling an ability to avoid a premature increase in temperature within the wellbore annulus - summarizes the context of this presentation. Given the "size of the prize" and with encouragement by the U.S. Department of Energy, the President of the United States, Japan and others that have announced commitments to developing the technology base to allow commercial production of methane from hydrates deposits by the year 2015, a purpose of this endeavor is to assist in launching serious discussion about methane hydrate drilling technology. MPD has been practiced onshore for at least the past two decades with good success.

AB  - SummaryThe platform PETROBRAS 25 (P-25) is operating at Albacora field, located at the northeast portion of Campos Basin, offshore Brazil, about I 10 Km from the coast, in a water depth that varies from 230 to 1600 m. This unit, originally a drilling platform, was converted into a production floating system with process capacity of 100,000 bpd of oil and 3,000,000 m3/d of gas, P-25 is moored in a water depth of 520 m, receiving the production from 13 satellite wells and 2 diverless subsea production manifolds (MSPDL-I e MSPDL-2), with 8 wells each. These 2 manifolds were considered the deepest in the world at that time, installed in 500 and 620 m, and are improved with features like multiplex control pod and vertical connection. To reach this important mark, a lot of things have been done, including operational procedures to prevent hydrate formation. Nevertheless, seven months after the unit started producing, a total blockage in two wells in each manifold caused by hydrates occurred. The purpose of this paper is to describe how hydrate formation took place and the actions taken to unblock the manifold and restore the production. IntroductionHistorically, the hydrate formation in petroleum multiphase flow lines occurs after a shutdown or when the well went on stream. One classic example is, after an emergency shutdown in the unit, the down-hole safety valve (DHSV) of the well closes. Then could occur some gas segregation right down the DHSV and some free water right over it. When the well is open, the contact gas-water on a high pressure and low temperature ambient occurs around the DHSV, creating conditions to hydrate formation and, as a consequence, the production line is plugged. To avoid hydrate formation in P-25, the following procedure was adopted: Before open any well, we circulated diesel on the wellhead, flowing by the gas-lift line and keeping WI, W2 and XOV valves open. We calculated the gas-lift and production lines volume and filled them with diesel. Whenever it was possible, we launched a low-density foam pig, lead by the diesel flow, cleaning completely the lines. Then, we equalized the pressure over the DHSV valve, pumping diesel and keeping the MI valve open and WI valve closed, When, there was a diesel injection right through the DHSV, we pressurize the hydraulic line to open this valve. After the confirmation of the DHSV opening, we put the well on stream.Problem DetectionThe start-up of the wells AB-43 (MSPDL I) and AB-38 (MSPDL2) follows the procedure that was described before, with some changes, because these wells are connected to the subsea production manifolds. As we can see in the P-25 submarine system diagram (figure I), connecting each manifold to the platform, there are a main production line (10 in at MSPDL-I and 8 in at MSPDL-2), a main gas-lift injection line (4 in for both manifolds), a test production line (4 in for both manifolds) and a service line (8 in for both manifolds) used to individual measurement of the gas-lift injection.

AB  - Abstract The application of extended subsea networks and transportation of unprocessed well-streams are amongst favorable options for reducing field development and operational costs. These pipelines normally convey a cocktail of multiphase fluids, including mixed electrolyte produced water and liquid and gaseous hydrocarbons and may therefore be prone to hydrate formation, which potentially can block the pipe and lead to serious operational problems. For deep water operation, even saturated saline solutions may not provide the required protection, unless combined with chemical inhibitor. The reported data on hydrate formation in mixed salt and chemical inhibitor are very limited and in some cases inconsistent.  In this work, a model is introduced to predict the hydrate free zone in mixed salt and chemical inhibitor designed for offshore and deep water applications. The model is based on combination of the Valderrama modification of the Patel-Teja equation of state with non-density dependent mixing rules and a modification of a Debye-Hückel electrostatic term, which is applied to systems containing salt and chemical inhibitor by correcting the properties of the aqueous phase such as dielectric constant, density and molecular weight. A linear mixing rule is used for determining the dielectric constant of salt-free mixture by introducing an interaction parameter (in dielectric constant mixing rule), which is tuned using the freezing point data of aqueous solutions containing salt and organic inhibitor. The binary interaction parameter between salt and organic inhibitor is adjusted using water vapor pressure data in the presence of salt and organic inhibitor. The predictions are compared with experimental data and a literature model, demonstrating the reliability of the developed model. Introduction Accurate knowledge of phase behavior in water-hydrocarbon systems, especially in the presence of salt and/or organic inhibitor is crucial to the design and operation of oil and gas pipelines and production/processing facilities. The application of extended sub-sea gathering networks and the transportation of unprocessed well-streams are favorable options for reducing field development and operational costs. These lines will convey a mixture of multi-phase fluids, including mixed electrolyte produced water and hydrocarbons. One serious concern is that these pipelines and production/processing facilities are prone to hydrate formation, giving rise to pipeline blockage, operational problems and other safety concerns. These can be avoided by either operating outside the hydrate region or transporting hydrates as slurry. The economics of the first option is largely dependent on the accurate determination of the hydrate phase boundary, whereas the amount of hydrates to be transferred could be the main factor in the success of the second option.[1] Many models have been developed that are able to predict the phase equilibria of mixtures containing both electrolyte and non-electrolyte compounds. This is usually done by either introducing complex mixing rules to an equation of state or by coupling the equation of state (short-range interactions) with a Debye-Hückel (D-H) electrostatic term (long-range interactions). The available models are normally developed for electrolyte solutions in the absence of organic inhibitors (e.g., alcohols). However, in cases where the inhibition effect of the produced saline water is not adequate for avoiding gas hydrate formation, organic inhibitors (e.g., methanol, glycol) are added to the pipelines, resulting in a system containing both salt and organic inhibitor. In these cases, it is necessary to take into account the hydrate inhibition effect of combined salt and organic inhibitor. The simplest possible solution is to assume that the combined effect of salts and organic inhibitors on the water activity is the sum of their separate effects. Nasrifar et al.[2] showed that additivity of activities could be assumed if the interaction between the salt and organic inhibitor is neglected. Later, Jager et al.[3] suggested that theoretical models must properly account for the interaction of all species in the water solution in order to predict the effect of mixed inhibitors correctly.

AB  - ABSTRACT The paper presents an experimental investigation on formation rate of methane hydrates. The aim of this study is development of production plant of natural gas hydrates. Formation rate of methane hydrates under constant pressure, which is considered to be suitable condition in the continuous formation process, was obtained by this experiment. In this paper, driving force for hydrate growth under the condition is defined by the supercooling at higher stirring rate. It is also shown that experimental pressure depends on formation kinetics. INTRODUCTION Natural gas hydrates are expected as unconventional natural gas resources because the amount is estimated at rich by worldwide distribution. One of the characteristics of hydrates is a high accumulation of gases. Therefore the usage of gas hydrate can be a new way of transportation and storage. In respect of the transportation and storage by using gas hydrate, object of the process is not only natural gas digged as hydrate but also as conventional gas state. It is necessary to develop the technology to produce rapidly natural gas hydrate in large quantities and also the technology of re-gasification. Consequently, the investigation about formation rate and dissociation rate of gas hydrate is important for industrialization. The formation apparatus of gas hydrate in laboratories are usually batch process that certain amount of gas and water are enclosed in a reaction vessel in advance. For industrial usage such that the production plant of natural gas hydrate, continuous process is indispensable. Therefore a semi-batch apparatus which could continuously supply gas during the formation period was used in order to obtain the formation rate of gas hydrate, In this paper, hydrate from methane gas was studied as a fundamental investigation since methane is a major content of natural gases.

AB  - Summary It is generally accepted that the volume of natural gas contained in the world's gas hydrate accumulations greatly exceeds that of known gas reserves. There is also growing evidence that natural gas can be produced from gas hydrates with existing conventional production technology. Advancements in nuclear-magnetic-resonance (NMR) logging and wireline formation testing have allowed for the characterization of gas hydrate reservoirs at the pore scale. Integrated NMR and formation testing studies from northern Canada and Alaska have yielded valuable insight into how gas hydrates are physically distributed in sediments and the occurrence and nature of pore fluids (i.e., free-water along with clay- and capillary-bound water) in gas hydrate-bearing reservoirs. Information on the distribution of gas hydrate at the pore scale has provided invaluable insight on the mechanisms controlling the formation and occurrence of gas hydrate in nature along with new data on gas hydrate reservoir properties (i.e., porosities and permeabilities) needed to accurately predict gas production characteristics for various gas hydrate production methods.   Introduction - Gas Hydrate Reservoir Models In recent years significant progress has been made in addressing key issues controlling the formation and occurrence of gas hydrate in nature. One of the most important factors that contribute to the formation of gas hydrate is the physical properties of the host reservoir. The study of gas-hydrate samples indicates that the physical nature of in-situ gas hydrates is highly variable (reviewed by Sloan and Koh, 2008). Gas hydrates are observed (1) occupying pores of coarse-grained rocks; (2) nodules disseminated within fine-grained rocks; (3) a solid substance, filling fractures; or (4) a massive unit composed mainly of solid gas hydrate with minor amounts of sediment. Most gas hydrate field expeditions, however, have shown that the occurrence of concentrated gas hydrate is mostly controlled by the presence of fractures and/or coarser grained sediments in which gas hydrate fills fractures or is disseminated in the pores of sand-rich reservoirs (Collett, 1993; Dallimore and Collett, 2005; Riedel et al., 2006; Collett et al., 2008a, 2008b; Hutchinson et al., 2008; Park et al., 2008; Yang et al., 2008; Fujii et al., 2008). Torres et al., (2008) concluded that hydrate grows preferentially in coarse-grained sediments because lower capillary pressures in these sediments permit the migration of gas and nucleation of hydrate. The growth of gas hydrate in clay-rich sediments, however, is more poorly understood and appears to be limited to mostly massive occurrences.   URTeC 1579782

AB  - Summary Seismic recognition technologies are widely adopted in the exploration and development of oil and gas fields. There are significant physical property contrasts between the gas hydrate, including its entrapped gas zone, and host rocks. This allows identification for them with seismic techniques. The previous research findings prove that acoustic methods are highly effective in determination of hydrates distributed widely. This is because hydrates have strong acoustic reflection effect. Their acoustic velocities are as twice as those of seafloor sediments. If the sediment underlying a hydrate entraps natural gas, its acoustic velocity will become much lower, resulting in vivid characteristics of reflections. This paper firstly discusses the seismic signatures of hydrates based on a physical model. The gas hydrate possibly presented in the target is then identified from seismic data by seismic phase characteristics and AVO attributes.

AB  - Natural gas (NG), which normally consists chiefly of methane, is a widely distributed resource, and until recently was generally thought to occur within the lithosphere as either a free or dissolved gas. During the 1960s, however, Soviet scientists began to recognize that NG could additionally occur in nature as a "solid gas:" that is, in a stable ice-like form. For historical reasons, this NGcontaining solid was referred to as "methane hydrate: '' though a more technically correct name for this compound is a water clathrate of natural gas. It is now recognized that methane hydrates can occur in two basically different environments where the relatively low temperatures and high pressures necessary for hydrate formation are widespread. The first area where these zones of hydrate stability can occur is in or near terrestrial permafrost regions, which encompass vast areas of the world''s landmass. The second region where hydrate formation is favored covers more than 90% of the world''s ocean basins. The amount of NG trapped in the hydrate form has been estimated by some Russian workers as more than 1 x 10 18 m3 (STP) (Barraclough, 1980). The total worldwide energy consumption is currenlty about 7.6 x 10 l2 m3/yr gas equivalent. If we assume that only one-half of the Russian estimate is correct (0.5 x 10" m3), only 30% of this revised estimate can be produced (0.15 x 10 18 m3), and the worldwide energy consumption increases to 1 x lO 14 m3/yr gas equivalent, there is enough producible NG from this resource to supply the worldwide energy consumption for 1500 years. The logging results from two wells in different environments that penetrated methane hydrate are compared. The first well, Northwest Eileen State No. 2 (NW Eileen # 2), is located on the North Slope of Alaska. The second well, Hole 570, is located offshore in the Pacific Ocean about 60 km south of the coast of Guatemala in 1698 m of water. Estimates of the methane gas in a hydrate zone in each well were calculated from the logs as: Well Hydrate Thickness Gas Estimate NW Eileen # 2 9.0 m 412 x 106m3/km2 Hole 570 15.0 m 240-1400 x 106m3/km2 The logs from both wells are similar in character, clearly define the methane-hydrate zones and suggest existence of possible commercial natural gas deposits.

AB  - ABSTRACT From the 5 year preliminary study, BSR was found in the East Sea, Korea. 1st phase of the national gas hydrate program has been conducted for three years from 2005. During this phase, 2-D and 3-D seismic surveys and sedimentary core sampling were carried out. After processing and interpretation of the acquired data, prospective area and drilling sites were selected. In 2007, KIGAM research team successfully sampled natural gas hydrate at the selected drilling sites using piston corer. Massive and disseminated gas hydrate samples were also found during the drilling of around 200 m depth. INTRODUCTION Gas hydrates are solid, ice-like materials containing molecules of gas bound in a lattice of water molecules. Gas hydrates are stable under conditions of low temperature and high pressure and thus, are found in sub-oceanic sediments in the polar regions and in continental slope sediments (Sloan, 1998). Gas hydrates draw a great attention for the last 20 years as a new clean energy resource substituting conventional oil and gas. Many countries including U.S., Japan, Canada, Germany, China and India have launched extensive research programs to study the characterization of gas hydrates and eventually to produce them from the ocean. Preliminary Korea gas hydrates study was carried out during the period from 2000 to 2004 and bottom simulating reflector (BSR) was found in the East Sea, Korea (Lee and Im, 2005), thereafter intensive gas hydrate study has begun from 2005. During the 1st phase of the program from 2005 to 2007, the extensive 2-D seismic survey, 3-D seismic survey and sedimentary core sampling were carried out and evidences indicating the possibility of presence of gas hydrates were secured. The geophysical evidences, such as BSR, chimney structure, gas seepage structure, enhanced reflector and acoustic blanking zone.

AB  - Abstract A new method to predict incipient gas hydrate formation in systems containing an aqueous phase in the absence or presence of inhibitors is proposed. proposed. The method which is based on the statistical termodynamic model of van der Waais and Platteeuw for clathrates is implemented in a computational codes Results of several simulations are analysed and compared with experimental data from 67 systems of the literature and Petrobras fields, obtaining good agreement between calculated and observed dissociation pressures, chiefly in multicomponent hydrocarbon systems. pressures, chiefly in multicomponent hydrocarbon systems. Owing to its good performance, the method can be applied as a robust tool in process design or in field operations in which gas hydrate equilibrium calculations are necessary. Introduction Gas hydrates ( or simply hydrates) are ice-like crystalline compounds that form when water and gas come into contact, normally at low temperatures and high pressures. Hydrates belong to a peculiar group of substances known as clathrates, which are compound containing two or more components joined hot by an ordinary chemical bond but by the complete enclosure of one type of molecule inside a suitable structure formed by another molecule. Since the discovery of the first hydrate, studies on these compounds have been purely academic and thus restricted to the scientific community. With the development of the US petroleum industry starting in the thirties, the study of hydrate formation gained momentum, particularly when Hammerschimidt proved that the pipeline clogging problems typically encountered during winter months were cased by the formation of hydrates rather than of ice, as had been thought previously. Innumerous researchers soon began studying this phenomenon and produced a number of predictive methods based on theories ranging from simple empirical predictive methods based on theories ranging from simple empirical correlations to the detailed microscopic study of intermolecular forces. Due to Brazil's climate, specifically to its high temperatures, hydrate formation in petroleum facilities had never presented a serious problem. However, with the steady advance of production activities into problem. However, with the steady advance of production activities into deeper and deeper waters, the possibility of low seafloor temperatures causing hydrates to form inside pipelines has increased substantially. Although the literature presents a number of predictive methods, at the time that these were proposed they were only compared against experimental data on simple gas systems. Their application to more complex gas systems, such as natural gas, may lead to serious errors. The purpose of this study was to optimize process design and operational procedure concerned with the formation of natural gas hydrates, by providing reliable predictions of the conditions under which the phenomenon will occur and which include the presence of inhibitors. A new predictive method based on van der Waais and Platteeuw's theory is proposed and implemented in FORTRAN ANSI 77 computational code. The proposed and implemented in FORTRAN ANSI 77 computational code. The results of several simulations are analyzed and compared with the experimental data on multicomponent mixtures available in the literature or obtained in Brazilian oil fields. SOME ASPECTS OF THE CRYSTALLINE STRUCTURE OF HYDRATES Hydrates crystallize into two types of structure, known as I and II.

AB  - Summary. An analytical model that describes hydrate dissociation under thermal stimulation in porous media is presented. The model views the dissociation as a process in which gas and water are produced at a moving dissociation boundary. The boundary separates the dissociated zone containing gas and water from the undissociated zone containing the hydrate. A similarity solution to the conservation equations is derived, and results are presented in graphical forms that are useful in numerical computations. In particular, heat fluxes, temperature profiles, and gas pressure distributions are presented for two cases that simulate saturated-steam and hot-water thermal stimulation. A parametric study showed that the dissociation rate is a strong function of the thermal properties of the system and the porosity of the porous medium. The energy efficiency of the dissociation process, defined as the ratio of the heating value of the gas produced relative to the heat input, was also computed. For hydrate thermal stimulation, an energy efficiency value of about nine was found, which appears encouraging for natural gas production from hydrate. IntroductionSubstantial amounts of natural gas hydrates have been found in the earth's sediment beneath the permafrost in Arctic basins and in ocean-bottom sediments along the continental margins of the U.S. Because of this potential resource, the problems associated with the production of natural gas from these hydrate zones have become of greater interest to the hydrocarbon industry. Preliminary simulation studies have been performed for the production of natural gas from hydrate reservoirs through thermal injection, depressurization, and in-situ combustion. Apart from gas production modeling, few studies are available on the heat and mass-transfer rates accompanying hydrate dissociation. Kamath et al. and Kamath and Holder viewed heat transfer during hydrate dissociation as a nucleate boiling phenomenon, while Selim and Sloan viewed it as a moving-boundary ablation process. Experimental results acquired by Ullerich et al. on the dissociation of methane hydrates agreed well with predictions from the ablation model. The heat-transfer models presented by Kamath et al. and Selim and Sloan are useful in modeling pure hydrate dissociation processes. For gas hydrates in the earth's sediment, the heat and mass-transfer rates are strongly influenced by the surrounding sediment. In this paper, an analytical model that describes hydrate dissociation in sediment under thermal stimulation is presented. Results from the model are used to evaluate gas production from hydrate reservoirs by steam or hot-water thermal stimulation. Dissociation Model Consider a uniform distribution of hydrates in the porous medium in Fig. 1, which is initially at a uniform temperature Ti and occupies the semi-infinite region 0 less than x less than infinity. Initially, the hydrates are assumed to fill the entire porosity, phi, so that 1 - phi is the volume fraction of the sediment. At time t=0, the temperature at the boundary x=0 is raised to a new temperature, T0, that is higher than Ti and is held constant thereafter. Hydrate dissociation commences, and as a result, a moving interface that separates the water/gas region from the undissociated hydrate region exists at some distance x=chi(t). Thus, at any time t greater than 0, the water/gas phase [dissociated-hydrates zone (Zone I)] occupies the region 0 less than x less than chi(t), while the undissociated-hydrate zone (Zone II) occupies the region chi(t) less than x less than infinity. Once the hydrate-dissociation temperature is exceeded, the phase interface will move forward at a decreasing velocity. The interface velocity decreases because of the insulating effect of the increasing thickness of the dissociated zone and also because of the energy required to elevate the temperature of the matrix material and resulting gas and water. A sharp density change usually occurs in the pore-filling material across the phase interface. According to the law of mass conservation, the gas will be streaming or transpiring toward the accessible or heated surface. The surface heat flux is consumed in supplying energy (1) to heat the dissociated Zone I, (2) to heat the dissociated gas streaming toward the heated surface and the water resulting from the dissociation process, (3) to dissociate the hydrate at the moving interface, and (4) to heat the undissociated solid matrix. Consequently, the following temperature and pressure distributions develop in the system: (1) a temperature distribution TI(x,t) in Zone I with Td less than TI(x, t) less than T0; (2) a temperature distribution TII(x,t) in Zone II with Ti less than TII(x,t) less than Td; and (3) a pressure distribution p(x,t) for the hydrocarbon gas in Zone I with p0 less than p(x,t) less than pd. Here Td and pd represent the temperature and pressure at the dissociation front, assumed to be in thermodynamic equilibrium. Fig. 1 is a schematic of these distributions. The water resulting from the dissociation process is assumed to remain motionless and is retained within the pores of the dissociated zone. This assumption restricts the analysis to hydrate saturation values of about 0.3. For the sake of simplicity, we assume that the thermophysical properties of each phase are constant. We also neglect viscous dissipation, reversible work of compression, and inertial effects, and rule out the possibility of mutual or external energy transmission. With these restrictions, the differential mass, momentum, and energy balances describing the dissociation process may be written as (1) (2) (3) (4) (5) Eqs. 1 and 2 are the continuity equation and the momentum equation (Darcy's law) of the gas in the dissociated phase. Eqs. 3 and 4 are the energy balances for the dissociated and undissociated phases, respectively. Eq. 5 is the equation of state (EOS) of the gas, assuming ideal behavior; this may be easily modified through use of a more sophisticated EOS or compressibility factors. In the energy balance for the dissociated zone, it has been assumed that the transpiring gas always acquires the local temperature of the sediment--i.e., it reaches an equilibrium heat-transfer condition with the solid. In a similar investigation dealing with the mechanism of heat exchange in sweat-cooled porous materials, Weinbaum and Wheeler demonstrated that the local gas and solid temperatures are nearly indistinguishable throughout the porous structure. The boundary and initial conditions associated with the above equations are (6) (7) (8) (9) (10) SPERE P. 245^

AB  - Abstract Extensive studies have been conducted on hydrate formation in gaseous systems; however, little information is available on hydrate risks in oil systems. This is partly due to difficulties in measuring the hydrate stability zone in oil systems, as well as problems associated with compositional representation of such systems. Furthermore, it is reported that hydrate formation pose less risks in oil systems than gas systems, partly due to the presence of natural inhibitors, formation of water in oil emulsions, and possibly oil wet pipeline walls. However, little is known of the nature and mechanism of the natural inhibition and the response of the system to an increase in the water cut. In this communication, we present details of two experimental set-ups specifically designed to study the hydrate risks in oil systems. They include a visual high pressure kinetic rig for measuring the hydrate stability zone, crystal size, distribution and the rate of hydrate formation and dissociation, and a glass micromodel for visual observation of hydrate formation / dissociation in micro-scale. We report some of the recently obtained experimental results using the above experimental equipment. The results show that the existing techniques should be revisited for generating reliable data in oil system. We also demonstrate that proper characterization of the heavy end and taking into account the possibility of wax formation may play a role in improving the reliability of predictive techniques. The results provide better understanding and evaluation of risks associated with hydrate formation in pipelines carrying oil. Introduction As deepwater offshore production is widely developing, the problem of flow assurance becomes of major importance. In deepwater pipelines, where reservoir fluids including gas, oil and water with dissolved salts and organic inhibitors are flowing together at low temperatures and high pressures, the formation of hydrates may occur leading to pipeline restriction and blockage. In order to plan the pipeline design and operation and prediction of the hydrate phase boundary, using thermodynamic models is required. The development and validation of the models relies upon experimental study of gas hydrates.[1] There is a significant bank of information available for gas systems that form gas hydrates.[1,2] However, there is significantly less information for oil systems, particularly real reservoir fluids. On the other hand, hydrate formation is greatly influenced by the nature of the reservoir fluid produced. The presence of water/oil (W/O) emulsion greatly aids the transportation of hydrates as slurry in deepwater offshore production and transportation and can solve the problem of flow assurance, partly due to the presence of natural inhibitors (e.g., asphaltene), formation of water in oil emulsions and possibly oil wet pipeline walls. Therefore, studying thermodynamics and kinetics of hydrate formation/ dissociation in oil systems is of great interest.  In this communication, a review is made on factors affecting thermodynamics of hydrate formation in oil systems. A thermodynamic model which is capable of predicting different scenarios such as hydrate and wax formation in reservoir fluids is then introduced and capability of the model is investigated. The details of two experimental set-ups specifically designed to study the hydrate risks in oil systems, including a visual high pressure kinetic rig for measuring the hydrate stability zone, crystal size and distribution and the rate of hydrate formation and dissociation and a glass micromodel for visual observation of hydrate formation/ dissociation in micro-scale are presented. Some of the recently experimental results using the above experimental equipments are also presented. The results can provide better understanding of hydrate formation/ dissociation in oil systems.

AB  - This article, written by JPT Technology Editor Chris Carpenter, contains highlights of paper OTC 28578, “Quantitative Ranking and Development of Hydrate Antiagglomerants,” by Shane A. Morrissy, Temiloluwa O. Kuteyi, Mike L. Johns, Eric F. May, SPE, and Zachary M. Aman, SPE, University of Western Australia, and Stuart F. McKay, SPE, Woodside Energy, prepared for the 2018 Offshore Technology Conference Asia, Kuala Lumpur, 20–23 March. The paper has not been peer reviewed. Copyright 2018 Offshore Technology Conference. Reproduced by permission. A common hydrate-management strategy involves the use of large volumes of thermodynamic inhibitors (THIs) to operate outside the hydrate-stability region. However, this strategy represents significant capital expenditure and operating costs. Low-dosage hydrate inhibitors (LDHIs), in the form of kinetic hydrate inhibitors (KHIs) and antiagglomerants (AAs), present an economical alternative to THIs. In this study, a quantitative micromechanical force (MMF) has been deployed to study the performance of seven industry AAs. The results illustrate that an effective AA is one that lowers the cohesive forces between hydrate particles. Introduction AAs prevent hydrate agglomeration of a steady-state hydrate slurry. Hydratephilic AAs are surfactants that adsorb to the hydrate/oil interface in preference to the water/oil interface. Current operating experience suggests that AAs may be unsuited to the high water cuts that are characteristic of late field life. A successful hydrate AA lowers the cohesive force or surface free energy of hydrate particles to prevent agglomeration. Rocking cells and high-pressure visual autoclaves provide a semiquantitative assessment of hydrate blockage. However, a knowledge gap exists with regard to whether current industry AAs actually lower hydrate interparticle cohesive and surface free energy. Techniques to deconvolute the mechanism of the action of AAs are required to better understand how AAs affect hydrate blockage. Experimental Procedure Micromechanical Hydrate Cohesive Force. A third-generation MMF apparatus was used to measure the cyclopentane hydrate interparticle cohesive force. The MMF uses cyclopentane to create Structure II cyclopentane hydrates, the same hydrate structure present in the field. The cohesive-force-measurement technique was adapted from previous re-search on hydrate cohesion and asphaltene cohesion. Interfacial Tensiometry. An optical interfacial tensiometer was used to measure the interfacial tension (IFT) between water and oil phases at ambient pressure and room temperature. A hooked needle with the AA prepared in paraffin oil was placed in a bulk phase of deionized water. The resolution of this apparatus is typically ±1 mN/m and the threshold sensitivity is 1 mN/m. Typically, surfactant-free systems will rap-idly reach equilibrium within 1 minute of creating an oil droplet in water. Conversely, the presence of a surfactant may decrease the IFT as a function of time, asymptotically approaching a steady-state value. Because the AAs studied contain surfactant functionality, each IFT was measured for at least 20 minutes, after which point the IFT was not observed to change with time. Each data point represents an average of at least four independent trials.

AB  - Abstract This paper describes the formulation and basis of the microcomputer, program, HYDRATE.BAS, which calculations hydrate formation conditions of natural gases. The program is based on the Carson and Katz program is based on the Carson and Katz method for hydrate predictions. It is designed for pressures in the range 100 to 2000 psia (700 to 1400 kPa), and temperatures between 32 and 80 degrees F (0 and 26 degrees C). Comparisons with published experimental data indicate average pressure deviations of +/- 30 psi (200 kPa) and temperature deviations, is of +/- 2 degrees F ( 1 degrees C). The program is written in BASIC, for Osborne 1*, IBM PC** and compatibles. PC** and compatibles. Introduction Hydrates are solid crystalline inclusion-compounds (clathrates) which contain two components, referred to as host and guest. Free water molecules form a metastable crystal lattice, which is stabilized by light gas molecules (C1 through C4 paraffins, carbon dioxide, and hydrogen sulfide) occupying the crystal cavities. * Osborne 1 is a trademark of Osborne Computer Corporation ** IBM PC is a trademark of International Business Machines, Inc. Molecules larger than butanes cannot fit into the cavities and thus do not form hydrates. Hydrates cause problems by plugging pipelines, valves, and other process pipelines, valves, and other process equipment. Proper design, therefore, includes, predicting the conditions under which predicting the conditions under which hydrates may form. Several methods are available for predicting potential hydrate forming conditions: - experimental - graphical - graphical-analytical - analytical Early hydrate prediction methods are based on graphical techniques. Carson and Katz produced the first reliable hydrate produced the first reliable hydrate prediction method based on gas composition. prediction method based on gas composition. Campbell describes both graphical and graphical-analytical methods. The analytical technique developed by Parrish and Prausnitz depends on the mechanisms of statistical thermodynamics, and is probably the most widespread method in use probably the most widespread method in use today. Hydrate packages that are available on the market today are based on the Ng-Robinson modifications of the Parrish-Prausnitz technique. Normally the programs run on a timesharing/mainframe system. Recently, this method has also become able for microcomputers. P. 213

AB  - AbstractProduction and transportation of unprocessed wellstreams is economically an attractive option and may significantly enhance the development of many marginal oil and gas fields. These pipelines may however be prone to hydrate formation which potentially can block the pipe and lead to serious operational problems. These can be avoided by either preventing hydrate formation or allowing the formation of hydrates, but preventing their aggregation and transporting them as slurry. The first approach is the current practice in the industry and it can be more cost effective by determining the hydrate phase boundary more reliably. in the oil and gas industry, n-butane is generally regarded as the heaviest hydrate forming compound, and anything heavier than that as a non-hydrate former. Oil and gas condensate systems contain a significant amount of intermediate/heavy hydrocarbon compounds which recently have been found to be hydrate formers. The water produced with oil also contains dissolved salts which inhibit hydrate formation to some extent. If the formation of hydrates is to be avoided, information on the effect of heavy compounds and salts on the hydrate boundary is required. Recent studies suggest that some chemicals at low concentrations may modify the growth of hydrate crystals, preventing their aggregation and hence allowing their transportation as slurry. if the use of crystal growth modifiers are to be considered, it is required to determine the amount of hydrates to be transported as a slurry. This paper reviews briefly the effect of electrolyte solutions, benzene, and methyl cyclo-pentane (MCP) on the hydrate free zone and concentrates on new methods and equipment for measuring the amount and composition of different phases in hydrate forming conditions. An in house numerical model was successfully used for prediction of the hydrate free zone and compositional data. The developed model can be used as an engineering tool to determine the hydrate free zone for transportation of unprocessed well streams in sub-sea pipelines and gathering networks and also the amount of hydrates to be transferred as slurry where the use of growth modifiers is considered as an option. IntroductionGas hydrates are inclusion compounds in which certain compounds stabilise the cages formed by hydrogen bonded water molecules under favourable conditions of pressure and temperature. For hydrates to remain stable, a minimum fraction of these cavities have to be filled with guest molecules. The most common hydrate structures are those of structure I and ii, where each structure is composed of a certain number of large and small cavities formed by water molecules. For a molecule to enter a cavity, its size should be smaller than a certain value. Large molecule guests which can enter only a limited number of large cavities require smaller "help gas" molecules to mainly fill some smaller cavities sufficiently to stabilise hydrate crystals. Gas hydrates have been reviewed in depth by Sloan. The application of extended subsea gathering networks and transportation of unprocessed wellstreams are amongst favourable options for reducing field development and operational costs. These lines will convey a cocktail of multiphase fluids, including mixed electrolyte produced water, and liquid and gaseous hydrocarbons. A good knowledge of the behaviour of these complex systems is essential for confident and economical design and operation of associated fields, pipelines and processing facilities. P. 157^

AB  - Abstract Gas hydrates are recognized as a massive source of fossil fuel that could be far in excess of conventional hydrocarbon resources.  The evaluation of formations that contain gas hydrates is therefore receiving renewed emphasis through contemporary petrophysical technology.  A key factor is the use of logging-while-drilling (LWD) to sense hydrate-bearing intervals before drilling-induced thermal invasion and thence hydrate dissociation take hold.  Recent advances in LWD technology have brought most of the potentially diagnostic tools onto the drill string, so there is little disadvantage in not having a wireline database.  Moreover, modern tools have a sharper spatial resolution and a greater capability for differential depths of investigation.  Petrophysical models have to be capable of distinguishing hydrates from ice in permafrost regions: this complication does not exist subsea.  In general, pristine hydrates are characterized by high resistivity, low sonic transit time, and low density, possibly in conjunction with gas shows from mud logs.  High neutron porosity can also be diagnostic away from permafrost.  Other tools with a role to play include dielectric tools, for distinguishing ice from methane hydrate; electrical imagers, for identifying the mode of hydrate occurrence; and magnetic resonance tools, for contributing to estimates of hydrate volume by difference, because of hydrate invisibility.  These matters are important, because a hydrate-supported structure will not produce as well as a framework-supported structure due to pore collapse with dissociation.  The evaluation process is guided by some laboratory measurements of recovered and synthetic hydrates and sand/hydrate mixtures.  The methodology is illustrated by field examples.  Although formation evaluation for gas hydrates remains largely semi-quantitative, current interests are driving towards interpretation protocols that target estimates of producibility.  Indicators are provided as to how this objective might be best approached. Introduction Gas hydrates or clathrates were discovered in 1810 by the British chemist Sir Humphry Davy.  They were first sampled in deep ocean sediments in the Black Sea (Yefremova and Zhizhchenko, 1974) and subsequently through the Deep Sea Drilling Project (DSDP) (Kvenvolden and Barnard, 1983).  Today, they are recognized as being present in all continents.  Indeed, it has been estimated that gas hydrates contain hydrocarbon resources, typically methane, considerably in excess of the global fossil-fuel energy base.  Their potential energy value has assumed a high profile, because it brings together issues of Earth, sea, environment, climate and society. Because it is technically difficult and expensive to sample preserved gas hydrates for laboratory measurement, well logs are especially important in the evaluation of gas-hydrate-bearing intervals.  The use of well logs to evaluate gas hydrate formations has received attention over the past 25 years in a manner that was naturally conditioned by the logging technology of the day.  Mathews (1986) set out the log signature of methane hydrate using information from the DSDP and the North Slope of Alaska.  Subsequent analyses include Prensky (1995), Collett (1998a), Lovell et al. (2002), and Murray et al. (2005). This paper provides a contemporary overview of the petrophysical evaluation of formations that contain gas hydrates with a view to their exploitation.  The description adopts the terminology of the Petroleum Resource Management System (PRMS) published by the Society of Petroleum Engineers and others (March 2007).  Thus, for example, the term "hydrocarbon volume?? quantifies a gas volume in place referred to standard conditions of 60 °F and one atmosphere.  On the other hand, the term "resources?? relates to that portion of an in-place volume (at standard conditions) that is considered to be recoverable and that may be undiscovered or discovered.  Yet again, the term "reserves?? relates to resources that are discovered, remaining (in the subsurface), recoverable, commercial, and for which there exists a development plan.

AB  - Natural gases under pressure form crystalline hydrates with water.Experimental data are reported on four-phase equilibrium for themethane-propane-water, methane-pentane-water, and methane-hexane-water systems.Temperatures and pressures for equilibrium between gas, water-rich liquid,hydrocarbon-rich liquid, and hydrate were measured, as well as the percentagesof methane and propane in the hydrate. The data indicate that natural gashydrate behaves as a solid solution and that pentanes and heavier hydrocarbonsdo not enter into the solid phase. Vapor-solid equilibrium constants arepresented that permit the approximation of the conditions for hydrateformation, from the composition of a gas.IntroductionNatural gas hydrates have been the object of considerable research in recentyears, because of the trouble they have caused in the natural-gas andnatural-gasoline industries. Natural gas hydrates are white crystallinecompounds of water and gas, which, under pressure, exist at temperaturesconsiderably above the freezing point of water. Because of the relatively hightemperatures at which the hydrates exist, they become a nuisance inhigh-pressure gas operations where water is present, since their formationcauses partial or complete plugging of valves and pipes. From a practicalstandpoint, the trouble incident to hydrate formation has been solved bydehydration of the gas before it enters the plant or pipe line, or by otherremedial measures.Extensive work on gas hydrates in the latter part of the nineteenth century,by Villard and others, gave data on methane hydrate and on ethane hydrate.Schroeder summarized these theoretical studies, Hammerschmidt introduced theinformation on gas hydrates to the gas industry, and Deaton and Frost gathereda considerable number of data on the behavior of natural gas hydrates. Recentpapers have extended both the data and the theory of these hydrates.At present, data are available on temperatures and pressures of hydrateformation for pure methane, ethane, propane, n-butane, methane-ethane mixtures,methane-propane mixtures, methane-butane mixtures, and some 15 natural gases,all in the presence of excess water. However, up to the present time no methodhas been available for predicting the temperature at given pressures or thepressure at given temperatures at which natural gases will form hydrates ifsaturated with water.T.P. 1371

To evaluate slurry based hydrate technology, the flow properties of both water-based and oil-based hydrate slurries were investigated for different hydrate concentrations. This paper summarizes the production of oil-based hydrate slurries and the flow experiments performed on these slurries. The flow experiments were carried out in laminar and turbulent flow in a high-pressure pipe viscometer in the hydrate laboratory at the Norwegian University of Science and Technology (NTNU).

AB  - AbstractExperimental data are presented for hydrate formation conditions for gasmixtures of carbon dioxide and methane. Equilibrium constants for carbondioxide, defined as the mole fraction of carbon dioxide in the gas phase (drybasis) divided by the mole fraction of carbon dioxide in the hydrate (drybasis), were calculated using the equilibrium constants for methane developedin an earlier paper.IntroductionA series of papers have been written on gas hydrates, giving temperaturesand pressures at which hydrates would form. Vapor-solid equilibrium constantshave been developed for methane, ethane, propane and iso-butane by which it ispossible to compute for a specific gas mixture the temperature and pressure atwhich hydrates will form.Carbon dioxide is present in many natural gases in concentrations usuallyfrom 0.1 to 2.0 per cent. It also forms a gas hydrate with water and presumablyenters the solid solution when present with a natural gas which is forming ahydrate. The equilibrium constant giving the ratio of the concentration ofcarbon dioxide in the gas phase to the concentration in the solid phase isrequired for including the effect of the carbon dioxide when computing theconditions for hydrate formation.Direct determination of the concentration of carbon dioxide in solid hydraterequires a difficult separation to be made. Therefore, this research resortedto the measurement of the temperature and pressure at which specific mixturesof methane and carbon dioxide would form hydrates. From the equilibriumconstants previously mentioned for methane, it is possible to compute theequilibrium constant for carbon dioxide, without measurement of the compositionof the solid phase.Fig. 1 shows the conditions at which methane and carbon dioxide formhydrates.T.P. 2578

AB  - ABSTRACT:The capital costs of natural gas hydrate (NGH) and liquified natural gas (LNG) are compared, for the transport of 400 MMscf/d (about 4 billion Sm3 per year) of natural gas for a distance of 5500 km. The NGH chain was found to cost at least one-quarter less than the LNG chain. Independent studies in Norway, Canada and Russia have shown that frozen hydrates at atmospheric pressure remain stable long enough to make long-distance transport of natural gas in the form of hydrate technically feasible. INTRODUCTIONThe demand for natural gas in the world is increasing. Two regions are expected to continue to dominate the increase in gas demand; Europe and Asia Pacific (Commichau 1994, MeIIbye 1994, Voigt 1994). Large natural gas resources, however, are not located near the main population centers in the two regions. The transportation of natural gas over increasingly longer distances will consequently be required in Europe and Asia Pacific. The development of the natural gas industry in the next 5-15 years is 1ikely to be dominated by costs, as evident from statements by Exxon''s Voigt "The industry must continue to reduce project costs, keep gas competitive, and obtain prices in line with full market value" by Mobil''s Commichau "The gas industry faces tremendous challenges, which are mainly of an economic nature" and by Statoil''s MeUbye " ... that increasing volumes have to be transported over increasing distances ... can only be profitable if costs are reduced and prices are increased." Large-scale transport of natural gas is done in pipelines and by ship in liquified form. The cost of natural gas transport is such that pipelines are used for distances up to a few thousand kilometers, while transport of liquified natural gas (LNG) by ship is used for greater distances.

AB  - Technology Today Series articles provide useful summary information on both classic and emerging concepts in petroleum engineering. Purpose: To provide the general reader with a basic understanding of a significant concept, technique, or development within a specific area of technology. Introduction Gas clathrates (commonly called hydrates) are crystalline compounds thatoccur when water forms a cage-like structure around smaller guest molecules.Gas hydrates of interest to the natural gas hydrocarbon industry are composedof water and eight molecules: methane, ethane, propane, isohutane, normalbutane, nitrogen, carbon dioxide, and hydrogen sulfide. Hydrate formation ispossible in any place where water exists with such molecules-in natural orartificial environments and at temperatures above and below 32 degrees F whenthe pressure is elevated. Hydrates are considered a nuisance because they blocktransmission lines, plug blowout preventers, jeopardize the foundations ofdeepwater platforms and pipelines, cause tubing and casing collapse, and foulprocess heat exchangers, valves, and process heat exchangers, valves, andexpanders. Common examples of preventive measures are the regulation ofpipeline water content, unusual drilling-mud compositions, and large quantitiesof methanol injection into pipelines. We encounter conditions that encouragehydrate formation as we explore more unusual environments for gas and oil,including deepwater frontiers and permafrost regions. permafrost regions.Hydrates act to concentrate hydrocarbons; 1 ft 3 of hydrates may contain asmuch as 180 scf of gas. Large natural reserves of hydrocarbons exist inhydrated form, both in deep oceans and in the permafrost. Evaluation of thesereserves is highly uncertain, yet even conservative estimates indicate thatthere is perhaps twice as much energy in hydrated form as in all otherhydrocarbon sources combined. While there is one commercial example of gasrecovery from hydrates, the problems of in-situ hydrate dissemination indeepwater/permatrost environments will prevent their cost-effective recoveryuntil the next century. Basic Structure Hydrates normally form in one of two small, repeating crystal structures,shown in Fig. 1. The two hydrate structures are formed from a basic"building block" water cavity that has 12 faces with 5 sides per face(512). Linking the vertices of the 512 cavities results in Structure 1, withinterstices of large cavities composed of 12 pentagons and 2 hexagons (512 62).Linking the faces of the 512 cavities results in Structure 2, with intersticesof large cavities composed of 12 pentagons and 4 hexagons (512 64). Details ofstructure are given in a recent monograph. Structure 1, a body-centered cubicstructure, forms with natural gases containing molecules smaller than propane;consequently Structure 1 hydrates are found in situ in deep oceans withbiogenic gases containing mostly methane, carbon dioxide, and hydrogen sulfide.Structure 2, a diamond lattice within a cubic framework forms when naturalgases or oils contain molecules larger than ethane but smaller than pentane;Structure 2 represents hydrates that commonly occur in production andprocessing conditions, as well as in the cases of gas seeps in shallow oceanenvironments. The newest hydrate, Structure H, is neglected in this overview;it is yet to be found outside the laboratory. Inside each structure cavityresides a maximum of one of the eight guest molecules. The cavity occupied is afunction of the size ratio of the guest molecule within the host cavity. To afirst approximation, the concept of "a ball fitting within a ball" isthe key to understanding many hydrate properties. Much more certainty existswith respect of properties. Much more certainty exists with respect of themolecular structure of hydrates than to the kinetic mechanism of hydrateformation; hydrate kinetics are currently at the forefront of research. On amacroscopic level, hydrate formation and dissociation may be considered using aphase diagram, such as Fig. 2. In this figure, pressure is plotted vs.temperature, with gas composition as a parameter, for methane/propane mixtures.Consider a gas of any composition given on a line in Fig. 2. At conditions tothe right of the line, a gas of that composition will exist in equi-ibrium withliquid water. As the temperature is reduced (or as the pressure is increased),hydrates will form from the gas and liquid at the line, so that three phases(hydrates/gas/liquid water) will be in equilibrium. With further reduction oftemperature (or increase in pressure), the fluid phase that is not in excess(normally water) phase that is not in excess (normally water) will beexhausted, so that to the left of the line the hydrate will exist with theexcess phase (normally gas). phase (normally gas). Note that all the conditionsgiven in Fig. 2 are for temperatures above 32 degrees F, and that pressuresalong the lines vary exponentially with temperature. This figure alsoillustrates the dramatic effect of gas composition on hydrate stability; as anyamount of propane is added to methane, the structure changes (Structure lStructure 2) to a hydrate with much wider stability conditions. Note the markeddecrease in pressure (or increase in temperature) needed to form hydrates, whenas little as l% propane is in the gas. Hydrates can result from eithersaturated gas or liquid hydrocarbon, without a free-water phase; thesetwo-phase conditions are relatively rare and, thus, not addressed in thisoverview. Three common methods are used to predict the three-phase conditionslike those of Fig. 2. They are, in order of increasing accuracy, thegas-gravity chart,2 the Katz Kj charts,3 and a statistical thermodynamicsmethod.4 The first two calculation methods may be done by hand; a computer isrequired for the third method, which may be used to predict most threephaseconditions with acceptable accuracy. Applications in the Petroleum Industry Inhibition/Dissociation. The four common means of inhibiting/dissociatinghydrates are (1) removing one of the components, either the hydrocarbon orwater; (2) heating the system beyond the hydrate formation temperature at apressure; (3) decreasing the system pressure below hydrate stability at atemperature; and (4) injecting an inhibitor, such as methanol or glycol, todecrease hydrate stability conditions, so that higher pressures and lowertemperatures will be pressures and lower temperatures will be required forhydrate stability. These techniques are called thermodynamic inhibition becausethey remove the system from thermodynamic stability by changes in composition,temperature, or pressure. As long as the system is kept pressure. As long asthe system is kept outside thermodynamic stability conditions, JPT P. 1414

AB  - Abstract A major challenge in offshore development is to ensure unimpeded flow of hydrocarbons. Managing solids such as hydrates is the key to the viability of developing a deepwater prospect. Common methods to prevent and reduce hydrate risks are generally based on injection of thermodynamic inhibitors to prevent hydrate formation or use of kinetic hydrate inhibitors to sufficiently delay hydrate nucleation/growth. Currently, the amount of inhibitor required is either calculated and/or determined based on lab experiments. The amount of inhibitor depends on various parameters, including, water cut, inhibitor loss to hydrocarbon phases, aqueous and non-aqueous fluid compositions, operating conditions. Generally a safety factor is considered and the resulting inhibitor is injected upstream without much downstream measurements. Despite the usual safety margins, gas hydrates are formed which could result in serious operational and safety concerns. This is mainly due to changes in the system conditions (e.g., rates and water cut) and/or malfunction of one of the equipment. In most cases, the amount of inhibitor is more than what is necessary and is not adjusted with seasonal changes, affecting CAPEX/OPEX. As a result of a joint industry project several novel techniques, based on downstream and online measurements have been developed, for: Monitoring the hydrate safety margin to optimise inhibitor injection rates. The system determines the amount of inhibitor in the aqueous phase and the degree of inhibition they can offer. Detecting the initial hydrate formation, as an early warning system against hydrate blockage. The system detects the changes in the system due to hydrate formation with the aim of giving the operator enough time to prevent a blockage. The main advantages of the above techniques are minimising the amount of inhibitor required and preventing pipeline blockages due to hydrates, hence the cost of inhibitor, impact on the environment, cost of remedial actions and deferred production. A number of techniques have been investigated during this project with some techniques selected for prototype development. The developed prototypes have been tested. In this presentation, an update on the latest results of this new approach in flow assurance control is presented. Introduction The past decade has witnessed dramatic changes in the oil and gas industry with the advent of deepwater exploration and production. A major challenge in deep water field development is to ensure unimpeded flow of hydrocarbons to the host platform or processing facilities. Managing solids such as hydrate, waxes, asphaltene and scale is the key to the viability of developing a deepwater prospect. The oil industry is facing a flow assurance issue with hydrate deposits in pipelines where hydrate often forms at inaccessible locations. One of the problems other than blockage is the movement of the hydrate plugs in the pipeline at high velocity which can cause rupture in the pipeline. Any blockage in an oil/gas pipeline due to hydrate is a serious threat to the economics of the operations and also personnel safety. The conventional ways to prevent and reduce hydrate risks in transfer line and process facilities is to remove one of the elements favouring hydrate formation. For example, thermal insulation and external heating techniques are used to remove the low temperature element. Water can be removed by dehydration of the natural gas using glycol system and lowering the operating pressure can reduce the tendency for hydrate to form in the production system. However, these conventional techniques may not be feasible for some fields especially in offshore and deepwater environment due to space limitation and high insulation or heating cost. The deepwater insulation costs are reported typically US$1 million per km of flowline (Sloan, 1998).

AB  - Abstract Inhibitor injection is probably the most popular option for avoiding gas hydrate problems.  However, inhibitor injection rates are normally designed based on worst operating conditions (i.e., maximum pressure and minimum temperature) with significant safety margin (e.g., 3-5 °C).  Although the system pressure normally drops with time, the injection rates are not normally changed.  Furthermore, large quantities of inhibitors are used during start-ups and maintained until the system conditions at monitoring point is well outside the hydrate stability zone.  This is completely understandable considering the costs and risks associated with hydrate blockage which outweigh any savings associated with reducing inhibitor injection rates. However, high inhibitor injection rates are not sustainable later in the life of the reservoir when the water cut increases, hence there is significant interest in developing monitoring and warning systems that can adjust inhibitor injection rates and warn against any potential hydrate blockage. This laboratory has been investigating various techniques for monitoring hydrate safety margin and detecting early signs of hydrate formation for a number of years through several JIPs.  After screening many techniques we have developed two main techniques for monitoring hydrate safety margin (i.e., how far the system is outside the hydrate stability zone) and detecting early signs of hydrate formation.  The techniques have now been tested and implemented in many places around the world.  These techniques enable us to adjust inhibitor injection rates based on system parameters, hence a more reliable and cost effective hydrate prevention strategy.  In this communication we will present the developed techniques and some of the case studies. Introduction Injection of hydrate inhibitors is the most common measure to prevent hydrate blockages apart from dehydration and thermal insulation (including heating). There are three types of hydrate inhibitors in terms of inhibition mechanisms, including thermodynamic hydrate inhibitors (THIs), kinetic hydrate inhibitors (KHIs), and anti-agglomerants (AAs). THIs inhibit hydrate formation by shifting the hydrate phase boundary to lower temperature and higher pressure, moving the operation conditions outside the hydrate stability zone (HSZ), while KHIs do not prevent hydrate formation but delay hydrate nucleation and hinder hydrate crystal growth within a certain degree of subcooling, which allows the hydrocarbon fluids sufficient time to pass through the length of a transport pipeline where the thermodynamic conditions are inside the HSZ [1-5]. Contrary to THIs and KHIs, AAs allow hydrate formation but prevent individual hydrate crystals from agglomerating together, therefore, maintain the hydrocarbon system transportable [5, 6].

AB  - Abstract Gas production and transportation pose challenges for operators. Unprocessed gas streams in production and flow lines containing brine and hydrogen sulfide are particularly corrosive and susceptible to forming hydrates and scale deposits. Methanol is often added to such streams for hydrate prevention; however, methanol increases the corrosion tendencies of pipes and equipment because it can deactivate some Corrosion Inhibitors (CI) and adds oxygen to the system. As a result, if hydrates are controlled with methanol, the system requires extra amounts of properly selected corrosion inhibitors to counteract the oxygen induced accelerated corrosion. Corrosion rates of tubular steel exposed to sweet and sour brines were investigated. The sweet conditions contained carbon dioxide saturated brine, methanol, corrosion and gas hydrate inhibitors. Hydrogen sulfide was added to the system to create a sour environment. Methanol and hydrogen sulfide present in wet gas streams create an environment difficult for corrosion control; they accelerate corrosion rates to the point of rendering some commercial corrosion inhibitors unsuitable for corrosion protection. It was discovered that some gas hydrate inhibitors offer both, hydrates and corrosion protection. In addition it was found that the corrosion inhibiting properties of these gas hydrate inhibitors were enhanced in the presence of hydrogen sulfide. The dual action of the Low Dosage Hydrate Inhibitor (LDHI) described here can limit or even eliminate Corrosion Inhibitors in highly corrosive methanol containing sour gas/water streams; thus, LDHI application improves production and transportation economy by replacing high volumes of methanol with less costly volumes of LDHI and providing additional operational savings on CI. Introduction Gas hydrates form when water molecules crystallize around guest molecules. The water/guest crystallization process has been recognized since its discovery by Sir Humphrey Davy in 1810 it is well characterized and occurs with sufficient combination of pressure and temperature.[1] Light hydrocarbons, methane-to-heptanes, nitrogen, carbon dioxide and hydrogen sulfide are the guest molecules of interest to the natural gas industry. Depending on the pressure and gas composition, gas hydrates may build up at any place where water coexists with natural gas at temperatures as high as 30°C (~85ºF). Formation of undesired gas hydrates can be eliminated or hindered by several methods. The thermodynamic prevention methods control or eliminate elements necessary for hydrate formation: the presence of hydrate forming gas, the presence of water, high pressure and low temperature. The elimination of any one of these four elements from the system would preclude the formation of hydrates. Heating and insulating transmission lines is a common mechanical solution to the hydrate problem often encountered in long subsea pipelines. Gas dehydration is another method of removing a hydrate component. However, in a practical oil and gas operation, water can be economically removed to a certain minimum vapor pressure only and residual water vapors are always present in a dry gas. Hydrate plugs in "dry" gas lines have been reported in the past.[2] Tubular failures due to corrosion and pipelines plugging with solid hydrates are major concerns for gas production and transport operators. Hydrate plugs can form in a short time, often within a few hours at hydrate formation pressure and temperature (p/T) conditions. Corrosion is a significantly slower process taking months or years to manifest itself with hardware failing. Nevertheless, both processes can result in catastrophic consequences if left unchecked.

AB  - Abstract Constant energy molecular dynamics simulations are used to study the role of mass and heat transfer in the decomposition of methane hydrate. The rate of methane hydrate decomposition in a constant energy simulation is affected by heat and mass transfer arising from the breakup of the hydrate framework and release of the methane gas into the liquid phase. As the hydrate undergoes endothermic dissociation, temperature gradients are established between the remaining solid hydrate and the solution phases. Hydrate dissociation occurs in a concerted fashion with rows of sI cages parallel to the interface decomposing simultaneously. This leads to the release of large amounts of methane gas near the solid-liquid interface which can form bubbles that affect the rate of mass transfer between the phases. These phenomena can affect the rate of methane hydrate decomposition in natural methane hydrate reservoirs. I. Introduction Understanding the mechanism of methane hydrate decomposition under conditions similar to those of the hydrate sediments found on continental margins, under the ocean floor, and under the permafrost in the Arctic can assist in designing controlled methane recovery processes.[1-4] Hydrates can become unstable when heated or depressurized and this can lead to uncontrolled hydrate decomposition and catastrophic methane release. A sustained method of methane extraction from hydrate reservoirs is yet to be established. From experimental calorimetric measurements methane structure I (sI) clathrate has a heat of dissociation of 18.13 ± 0.27 kJ/mol (hydrate ? ice + gas) at 273 K and 101 kPa[5] and 54.4 ± 1.4 kJ/mol (hydrate? liquid + gas) at 292 K over a range of pressures up to 20 MPa.[6]

AB  - AbstractGas Hydrates - Occurance, Production and Economics Gas hydrates are crystalline compounds stable under particular conditions of low temperature and high pressure. Relatively large quantities of methane can be trapped in small volumes of hydrates, which represent a substantial in-situ natural reserve and resource in the shallow crust. In order to recover natural gas from this resource, it is necessary to dissociate the water structure and remove the gas. This is the reason why a new method is put forward: Hot Solvent Stimulation after Hydraulic Fracturing, with a method called S.T.S.F. The technique resembles Acid Fracturing but replaces Acid by Hot Solvent for the hydrate dissociation. Moreover, the method can be improved by drilling a second production well in order to control the solvent flow in the fracture and the gas production. The shape of the fracture can be either horizontal or vertical depending on the depth and the in-situ stresses. The following paper describes the development and applications of a heat transfer model, as well as the flow through the dissociated zone by leak-of f from the fracture. The analytical solution, obtained through the introduction of some simplifying assumptions, has two main advantages: it can be used without any digital computing equipment and can be easily handled by field engineers. Graphical results indicate that with S.T.S.F. method gas production and the energy efficiency ratio are three times as high as with any method. The paper ends with an attempt to analyse the economics of natural gas production from gas hydrates, assuming a satisfactory method of hydrates recovery. IntroductionOccurrences of gas hydrates are found at shallow depths of 200-1500m., where low temperatures 100-400K, and moderate pressures, 10 E.-2 to 2 -10 E.3 MPA, prevail. Gas hydrates are ice like crystalline inclusion substances composed of dodecahedral and tetracahedral water molecules cages, where methane and other light weight natural gas are trapped. Relatively large quantities of methane can be stored in small volumes of hydrates (1 cubic metre of 90% saturated hydrate contains about 180 standard cubic meters of methane). Since 1985 Soviet scientist have reported the existence of large deposits of natural gas hydrates in sediments under permafrost in Siberia (MARAGON, 1985). Later, gas hydrates were found under the permafrost in Alaska and Canada. More recently, extensive occurrences of hydrate deposits in ocean bottom sediments have been found along the North American and Mexican continental margin (KVENVOLDEN, 1988). P. 467

AB  - AbstractDeep Star funded a unique hydrate plug dissociation field test in a 900-psi 4-inch flowline gathering system operated by Kerr-McGee Corporation/Devon Energy in the Powder River Basin in Wyoming. In addition to DeepStar, the field test was supported by seven DeepStar member f m s (Amoco, ARCO, BP, Chevron, Kerr-McGee, Shell, and Texaco) by loan of equipment and analytical and computer services. During the field test, the formation of naturally occurring hydrate plugs was allowed in an existing flowline by stopping methanol injection. After formation, plugs were remediated by a unique one-sided depressurization. This reduction of the pressure on one side of the plug to below the hydrate decomposition curve results in a substantial pressure drop across the plug, as well as partial dissociation of the low pressure end of the plug that is outside the hydrate region. Plug formation and remediation were monitored by five data stations along the line. The pressure drop across a plug was monitored as a function of time to determine plug permeability while the plug was stationary. The pressure drop across a plug and the plug length were used to determine plug yield strength at breakaway. A dual-station gamma-ray system was used to measure slug and plug lengths and velocities at one data station. IntroductionHydrates are ice-like solids that form in hydrocarbon flowlines. Hydrates can deposit on the flowline inner wall and agglomerate in the flow stream, and with time, hydrates can block the flowline. Hydrate operational problems are most severe in high pressure flowlines in cold environments, such as in deep waters around the world where the seawater tem- perature is typically between 34° and 40°F. Hydrates are members of a chemical class of compounds Hydrocarbon water systems. Hydrates are solids composed of water and a gas (methane, CO,, etc.). The water forms a crystal lattice of cavities with pentagonal and hexagonal surfaces. Each cavity, or cage, may enclose a single mkthane (or other foreign) molecule.In some ways. hydrates are similar to ice. Hydrates have a density close to that of ice, and have an appearance like frost or ice. However, in contrast to ice, the decomposition temperature of hydrates increases with increasing pressure at pressures below 15,000 psi. A hydrate thermodynamic equilibriumcurve, or decomposition curve, (bold line) for a hypothetical oil/water/gas production system is shown in Fig. 1. The decomposition curve starts at around 100 psi and 34°F and rises to 3,000 psi at around 70°F. Hydrates may form at temperatures below and pressures above the hydrate decomposition curve. Also shown in Fig. 1 is a pressure-temperature profile curve (thin line with arrows) of produced fluids in a flowline from deepwater wells to a shallow water platform 40 to 60 miles away.

AB  - AbstractGas hydrates have been touted as the next generation of energy resources exploitable for commercial gain and anthropogenic use. It would then seem relevant to estimate the potential resources available in order that one has an appreciation of availability. Several such estimates have been made over the years for both onshore and offshore gas hydrates. This paper examines the relative percentages and the ranges of uncertainty for both the onshore and offshore estimates. In addition, the estimated resources are plotted versus the year in which the estimate was made to see if any convergence of results is being achieved with time as more data become available.The main conclusions are that there seems not to be any systematic pattern of convergence of resource estimates with time, nor does there seem to be any narrowing of the uncertainty of the estimates for either onshore or offshore resource estimates as more data have become available over the last twenty years. It would seem that a concerted effort is needed to improve estimates if there is to be any hope of assessing the commercial worth of hydrate resources and of deciding whether hydrates really do represent a significant exploitable energy resource on a worldwide basis.IntroductionAs a cleaner energy source than hydrocarbons, gas hydrates have often been advertised as an appropriate alternative. The fundamental question is whether there is a sufficient resource of gas hydrates, on a worldwide basis, to act as a dominant energy source for the future. To be sure there are also technical problems of extraction and production of hydrates, once found, be it in the onshore or offshore regions. But the technical and commercial risk problems are secondary in the sense that unless there is a sufficient worldwide resource of gas hydrates, then technical methods will not be developed to exploit a constrained limited resource. There would be no profit in so doing. Likewise, even if technical extraction methods already existed, there would be no worldwide xploitation of gas hydrates if the costs of involvement and recovery were to rise to a point were no profit could be made-much as happens with oil and gas fields today, which are often not produced because of too high a cost relative to potential gains.So the sine qua non is to first estimate the resources available. Indeed, this aspect has been recognized as the ultimate driver of potential further developments for over twenty years now (Kaplan, 1974). And, as new information has become available over the years, such has been incorporated in estimates of worldwide resources of gas hydrates both onshore and offshore. Since the early 1990's, after the dissolution of the Soviet bloc, much information has become available that heretofore was the exclusive province of the Soviet Union and/ or the intelligence gathering agencies of the world - most notably the CIA in America.

AB  - Abstract Phase equilibrium of gas hydrates is altered in porous media as compared to bulk systems. Inside porous media, the thermodynamic potential of chemical components changes due to molecular interactions with pore walls and due to the energy required to maintain capillary equilibrium. A pore-freezing model was developed that can be used to predict gas hydrate equilibrium for pure CH4, CO2 and mixed CH4-CO2 systems in saline pore waters for any given pore size distribution. The important feature of this model is that it takes into consideration salting out phenomena, i.e. increase in salt concentration due to gas hydrate and ice formation. It also gives the gas hydrate saturation in porous medium. A new EOS developed for prediction of bulk gas hydrate equilibrium conditions, based on van der Waals - Platteeuw model, is used in the pore freezing model and can also be used to calculate heats of formation of these hydrates for a given pore size and pressure. The results obtained from the model are compared with experimental results. Introduction Gas hydrates are crystalline compounds that occur under appropriate pressure-temperature conditions when water forms a cage-like structure around a smaller guest molecule. The guest molecule can be methane, ethane, nitrogen, carbon dioxide, etc. Gas hydrates are found in natural environments such as sea bottoms, under permafrost areas, and arctic locations such as West Siberian Basin in Russia, North Slope of Alaska, offshore locations such as Gulf of Mexico, Black Sea and Caspian Sea. Theoretical world-wide accumulations of natural gas hydrates exceed known hydrocarbon reserves on a per carbon basis even in modest estimates (Sloan, 1998).[1] Because of the acknowledged magnitude of the resource, there is rapidly growing world-wide interest in exploiting gas hydrate deposits for natural gas production. Depressurization, thermal stimulation, inhibitor injection, or combinations of these methods have been considered as possible means of methane recovery from gas hydrates. New advanced production concepts are also being proposed, such as the injection of a CO2-water microemulsion into the hydrate bearing porous media [McGrail et al. (2004){2}]. However, before large scale commercial recovery of natural gas from gas hydrates can be attempted, important issues regarding reservoir stimulation techniques, safety, and cost must be addressed through reservoir modeling. Fundamental to any reservoir simulation is the ability to accurately calculate the phase equilibrium behavior of the solids and liquids in the system. A large body of thermodynamic data exists for various clathrate hydrates in pure water, sea water, and other aqueous systems (Sloan 1998).[1] However, the effects of geologic media on gas hydrate stability have received comparitavely little attention. The fundamental physics and chemistry associated with gas hydrate formation and dissociation in porous media, and the physicochemical properties of the gas hydrates in sediments remain relatively poorly understood. The purpose of this work is to extend the well-developed thermodynamic theory of bulk gas hydrate equilibrium behavior to non-idealized porous media. The model described here predicts the hydrate equilibrium conditions for hydrate formation/dissociation conditions in a porous medium. The model is also capable of predicting hydrate saturations for any given pore size distribution. Theoretical background: Inside a porous medium, the thermodynamic potential of chemical components is changed with respect to bulk conditions as a consequence of molecular interactions at the pore walls, energy required to maintain capillary equilibrium and increase in ionic strength of residual pore water upon partial freezing due to salt exclusion from gas hydrate or ice formation. All these mechanisms decrease the activity of water in a pore and lead to hydrate formation at lower temperatures at given pressure and at higher pressures for given temperature. Therefore, the hydrate saturation also changes due to change in equilibrium conditions.

AB  - ABSTRACT:Experiments are performed in order to study the effect of hydrate formation on heat transfer in pipes. The hydrate formation in the horizontal flow of the gaseous refrigerant R134a and water is examined in a transparent test section at low pressure. The experiments conducted have shown that the formation of hydrates starts on the pipe wall. For certain flow condition~ the whole perimeter of the pipe wall is covered by hydrates and a solid hydrate layer is achieved. The thickness of the hydrate layer can be related to the measured pressure losses. The thickness of . the hydrate layer can be calculated, if a first order logarithmic function of the radial coordinate is assumed for the temperature field within the hydrate layer. Due to the decreasing flow cross section the heat transfer coefficient at the solid"liquid phase line increases for constant volumetric flow rates of water and gas. If the heat transfer rate to the hydrate layer matches the heat transfer rate transferred to the cooling agent, the hydrate layer will not grow up anymore. A stable hydrate layer is achieved. Criteria for achieving stable hydrate layers are presented. 1 INTRODUCTIONUp to now, crude oil and natural gas from subsea reservoirs are exploited by conveying the mixture of oil, gas, aqueous brine and entrained solids from the well along risers to the processing platforms, where the different phases of the well stream mixture are separated. Oil and gas as unprocessed materials are conveyed to the shore by pipeline or by tankers. The investment and operating costs of this kind of exploitation are high. The exploi~ tation of marginal gas fields is not economical yet. Developing these fields from. already existing platforms offers a possibility for reducing costs ..

AB  - AbstractNaturally occurring hydrates were discovered only 39 years ago (Makogon, 1965). Gas hydrates that contain large volumes of hydrocarbon energy accumulated in a few hundreds of meters of sediments near the earth surface. The potential volume of gas-in-place in a hydrated state is estimated to exceed 1.5x1016 m3. A single m3 of natural gas hydrate contains about 150-160 m3 of gas. About 98% of all gas hydrate deposits are found offshore in deep water in upper sedimentary layers. The most prospective regions are in the oceanic slopes. The thickness of hydrate-bearing rock may reach hundreds of meters, and in some conditions exceed 1 kilometer. Large amounts of free gas or liquid hydrocarbon can accumulate under the impermeable hydrate roof. Such coexistence of deposits can be very efficient for hydrocarbon production.There are many problems to be solved before we can produce gas from hydrate deposits. Natural gas hydrate research is currently being conducted in a number of countries, such as USA, Japan, Russia, and India. International collaboration will accelerate and increase the effectiveness of mastering these new resources of mineral energy accumulated in gas hydrate deposits. Knowledge of conditions of formation, stability and decomposition of hydrate and seawater and the mass ratios of gas and water during phase transition appears to be quite important.IntroductionNatural gas in geological sediments can exist as free gas, gas dissolved in reservoir water, or gas in the solid state. The distribution of gas among these phases is determined by thermodynamic conditions and the composition of the gas and water. Natural gas hydrates are a metastable mineral whose formation, stable existence and decomposition depend upon pressure, temperature, composition and other properties of the gas and water. The volume of gas in the sediments depends upon the geologic conditions in the regions and changes in those geologic conditions over time.The total potential resource of natural gas is over 3x1016 M3. This is further categorized as: Free gas - proved resource of natural gas - 1.56x1014 m3 (BP data, 2003).Solid hydrates - 1.5x1016 m3 (Makogon, 1984; Kvenvolden, 1988).Gas hydrates are clathrate inclusion compounds in which molecules ranging in size from 0.35 nm to 0.9 nm are hosted in a crystalline lattice formed by hydrogen-bonded water molecules. The formation, decomposition, and stable existence of hydrates depends upon the pressure, temperature, composition and other properties of the gas and water. Some hydrate properties have significant implications for energy production. One volume of water enclathrates 207 volumes of methane in the hydrate state, but because the specific volumes of hydrates are 26-32% larger than that of liquid water, one cubic meter of hydrate contains 164 m3 of methane at standard conditions. Hydrate formation is an exothermic process; therefore, hydrates release heat during formation and absorb heat during dissociation. Approximately 6-12 % of the energy contained within the gas hydrate is required to decompose that hydrate in natural conditions. Also, dissociation of methane hydrate to gas and water in a closed volume can generate very high pressures.

AB  - Abstract Due to availability, as well as economical and environmental considerations, natural gas is projected to be the premium fuel of the 21st century. Natural gas production poses risk of flow-line hydrate blockage from co-produced water and hydrateforming species. Common industry practice is the use of large doses of thermodynamic inhibitors such as alcohols; aside from undesirable environmental consequences, sufficient quantities of such thermodynamic inhibitors induces salt precipitation from co-produced water. Thermodynamic inhibitors affect bulk phase properties and inhibit hydrate formation. An alternative is changing interface properties by polymers and surfactants, effective at 3 to 0.5 % (or less) by weight of coproduced water. One group of low dosage hydrate inhibitors (LDHI) are kinetic inhibitors, which affect nucleation rate and growth. A second group of LDHI are anti-agglomerants, which prevent agglomeration of small hydrate crystallites. Despite great potential, work on hydrate anti-agglomeration is very limited. This work centers on the effect of NaCl and MgCl2 in mixtures of two vastly different anti-agglomerants. We use a model oil, water, and tetrahydrofuran as a hydrate-forming species. Results show that both salts—added in sufficient quantities—may result in the agglomeration of hydrates. Our results reveal a non-monotonic agglomeration behavior at low salt and/or large surfactant concentrations. Specifically, dissolved MgCl2 results in agglomeration more than the dissolved NaCl. Our measurements also show that the quaternary ammonium salt—i.e., quat—is more sensitive to dissolved salt than the nonionic rhamnolipid biosurfactant. In this work we show that the rhamnolipid biosurfactant is effective to a low concentration of 0.05 wt. % , yet quat has effectiveness down to 0.01 wt. %. The biosurfactant—with less toxicity and higher biodegradability—is an attractive alternative to chemical surfactants in anti-agglomeration. Results on the model systems show the promise for testing in real fluid systems and the field testing of the ideas. Introduction Due to potential supply from various subsurface formations and clean-burning characteristics, natural gas may provide a larger share of primary energy and surpass oil consumption in the twenty-first century. There is less CO2 produced from burning natural gas than other fossil fuels. Furthermore, produced CO2 can be separated from the combustion products and sequestered more readily than oil combustion products for improved oil recovery or storage in saline aquifers. However, thermodynamic conditions existing in gas production lines often favor formation of crystalline inclusion compounds known as gas hydrates. Water, co-produced with natural gas, forms lattice structures by hydrogen bonding; the structures are stabilized by guest molecules such as methane, propane, etc., under high pressures and temperatures in the range of a few degrees to 25 ºC(Sloan, 1998). Formation of gas hydrates occurs rapidly—unlike corrosion, scale, or wax buildup. This rapidity has undesirable safety and environmental consequences. Hydrate plug formation may lead to production shutdowns and even explosions due to large amounts of methane often contained within such plugs. Traditional hydrate prevention methods include physical means, such as insulation and electrical heating. Change of bulk phase properties through thermodynamic inhibition with methanol (MeOH) and monoethylene glycol (MEG) is widely used. Thermodynamic inhibitors shift equilibrium conditions to lower temperature and higher pressure(Dholabhai et al., 1997). Although well-characterized, these inhibitors often require large concentrations—as high as 60 weight % of co-produced water—which increase costs and have serious environmental impacts(Anderson and Prausnitz, 1986). An additional problem is that large concentrations of such inhibitors induce precipitation of salts when present in co-produced water(Masoudi et al., 2006). Such precipitation could lead to additional flow assurance problems.

The field of flow assurance, the coupling of multiphase flow and production chemistry, was born out of necessity as it has grown in concern to all operators.

AB  - ABSTRACTThe modelling work described here aims at establishing a chain of methods and models to describe flow of hydrate slurries in hydrocarbon transport lines. The chain starts with the rheological characterisation of hydrate slurries. The next level is a cross sectional model using this rheology to describe pipe behaviour of slurries. Finally a pipeline dynamic model describing the interaction of flow, terrain and boundary conditions at the reservoir and receiving plant.From the modelling and experiments it appears that the slurry has a much greater influence on rheology than indicated by standard correlations using average particle concentration. Also an increase in apparent wall roughness is predicted similar to what is observed in loop experiments. Both these effects are due to the skewed particle and velocity distributions predicted by the cross sectional model.

AB  - AbstractThis paper discusses the more significant advances in hydrate control technology in the past twenty years. It also presents a comparison of four of the more widely used methods for predicting the water content of natural gas hydrates and comments on their limitations.Some development is reported on the problem of controlling and preventing hydrate formation in offshore wells and onshore Arctic completions. Control techniques commonly used in these areas comprise variations on long-established practices such as application of heat, lowering system pressure, at least a partial dehydration of gas and/or liquid phases, addition of inhibitors, and purposeful formation of gas hydrates followed by their entrapment, decomposition and discharge of the water phase (known to many as the LTX system).HISTORICAL BACKGROUND:Although Sir Humphrey Davy first reported on hydrates of organic compounds in 1810, it was not until 1934 that Elmer G. Hammerschmidt1 described natural gas hydrates and their formation in natural gas transmission systems. A growing awareness of this problem led to extensive research or. several facets of gas hydrate formation by W.M. Deaton and E.M. Frost, Jr. of the USBM prior to World War II. These studies, though nearly complete, were interrupted by wartime activities and the results were not published until 1946 as USBM MONOGRAPH 8.2These and other investigations established the nature of hydrate formation in multi component mixtures of hydrocarbons and water and the effect of other gases such as H2, CO2, N2 and H2S on hydrate formation by hydrocarbon gases. Methods were developed to calculate the equilibrium conditions of hydrate formation, or in essence to predict the conditions under which hydrate formation is likely to occur in any of several pure and multicomponent hydrocarbon gas systems. Hydrate forming conditions for a number of binary systems containing water and hydrocarbons or CO2 and H2S are shown by the equilibrium curves of Figure 1. Generally, each component has a critical temperature above which no hydrate of this compound is formed. This temperature corresponds to the point of intersection of the equilibrium hydrate-formation curve of the hydrate forming compound. The figure shows H2S with the highest critical temperature. Therefore, natural gas systems containing H2S form hydrates more readily than do gases of the same density without H2S.By 1955, present-day technology had been developed and was in use by the petroleum industry. Several tenets were well-established, such as: Essential Conditions for Gas Hydrate Formation1. Favorable conditions of pressure and temperature of the gas.2. Presence of a liquid water phase.3. Thorough agitation between the phases. Methods for Preventing Gas Hydrate Formation1. Heating gas above hydrate formation temperature.2. Lowering gas pressure on the system.3. Dehydrate the gas to a level where no condensation occurs.4. Use of inhibitors to depress hydrate formation temperature.5. Use of the low-temperature separation process (LTX) which purposely forms hydrates by Joule-Thomson (J-T) expansion, separates them from the cold gas, moves them to a warm zone, and there hydrates are decomposed into hydrocarbons and water. The latter is discharged from the system. Inhibitor Choices1. Methanol2. Ethylene Glycol 3. Diethylene Glycol4. Others, including triethylene glycol, amonia, calcium, chloride brine, oil field brines, heavier alcohols, and aqueous sugar solutions.

AB  - Summary A major challenge in offshore development is to ensure unimpeded flow of hydrocarbons. Managing solids such as hydrates is the key to the viability of developing a deepwater prospect. Common methods to prevent and reduce hydrate risks are generally based on injection of thermodynamic inhibitors to prevent hydrate formation, or use of kinetic hydrate inhibitors to sufficiently delay hydrate nucleation/growth. Currently, the amount of inhibitor required is either calculated and/or determined based on lab experiments. The amount of inhibitor depends on various parameters, including, water cut, inhibitor loss to hydrocarbon phases, aqueous and non-aqueous fluid compositions, operating conditions. Generally, a safety factor is considered and the resulting inhibitor is injected upstream without much downstream measurements. Despite the usual safety margins, gas hydrates are formed, which could result in serious operational and safety concerns. This is mainly caused by changes in the system conditions (e.g., rates and water cut) and/or malfunction of the equipment. In most cases, the amount of inhibitor is more than necessary and is not adjusted with seasonal changes, affecting CAPEX/OPEX. As a result of a joint industry project, several novel techniques, based on downstream and online measurements, have been developed. These techniques could be divided into the following categories: Monitoring hydrate safety margin to optimize inhibitor injection rates. The system determines the amount of inhibitor in the aqueous phase and the degree of inhibition they can offer. Detecting initial hydrate formation, as an early warning system against hydrate blockage. The system detects the changes in the system caused by hydrate formation with the aim of giving the operator enough time to prevent a blockage. The main advantages of these techniques include minimizing the amount of inhibitor required and preventing pipeline blockages caused by hydrates, hence the cost of inhibitor; impact on the environment; cost of remedial actions; and deferred production. A number of techniques have been investigated during this project, with some techniques selected for prototype development. The developed prototypes have been tested in the project sponsors' laboratories and some in commercial production. In this paper, an update on the latest results of this new approach in flow assurance control is presented.

AB  - AbstractThe presence of c1athrates (gas hydrates) is well established observationally in the offshore region of the South Caspian Basin. This paper examines the potential hazards that can occur from hydrates for exploration rigs, production platforms and pipelines. Problems examined include hydrate formation zones, and explosive dissociation as a result of mud flows and/or uplift and rotation of submarine mud volcanoes. In addition, flame initiation by dissociation is also examined as a potential hazard, as are hazards due to drill penetration, warm circulation mud, and drill-bit heating of hydrates. Chemical composition of hydrates is shown to play a critical role in hazard evaluation, and seismic identification procedures for hydrate detection as bottom simulating reflectors (BSRs) are encouraged. Seismically-identified hydrates can be used to estimate thermal gradients in sediments without invasive procedures being required, and so to provide limits on the maximum thickness of hydrates in sediments. In addition, seismic procedures also provide a way of estimating hydrate composition. These non-invasive methods allow identification of worst-case hazard possibilities from hydrates.IntroductionThe offshore region of the South Caspian Basin is noted for a variety of hazards associated with gas-charged mud volcanoes. These hazards include: (i) breccia ejecta; (ii) gas eruptions; (111) mud flows; (iv) flame ignition; (v) earthquakes associated with eruptions; (vi) kilometer-long fissure production to widths of a few meters and escarpments to a few meters or tens of meters; (vii) slumping, pull-away and rotation of volcanic crests; (viii) gas-charging of overlying waters; (IX) gas-charging of highly unconsolidated surficial sedimentary layers, to the point that the seismic impedance of the sediments is occasionally lower than that of overlying waters; (x) clathrate production and dissociation; (xi) vertical and lateral motion of mud diapir crests; (xii) current washing away of surficial and near-surficial diapirs, volcanoes, and mud islands; (xiii) massive overpressure caused by gas and fluid in the mud material. Under particular conditions anyone or all of these hazard factors may be in effect at given times and for given locations. Based on Azeri historical data from mud volcanoes onshore, statistical probabilities were evaluated for breccia, gas eruptions, flaming, mud flows, earthquakes, and fissure production (Lerche et al., 1996), and were also used to provide preliminary assessments for hazards to exploration rigs, production platforms and pipelines in the offshore region of the South Caspian Basin. The remaining hazard factors in the above list do not have good statistical data bases of historical events from which to assess hazard probabilities in the offshore region, although isolated events are recorded. For instance, Dadashev et al. (1995) have compiled a temporal record of the appearances and disappearances of the offshore Chigil-Deniz Bank over the last 130 years, and of the numerous flame eruptions of Bakhar Bank and Zenbil Island. But, by-and-large, data are extremely sparse on mud diapirs and volcanoes in greater than 100 m of water. It then becomes difficult to provide hazard probabilities for the majority of the remaining hazards in the above list. An exception occurs for hydrates, because of direct gravity-core sampling of hydrates at or near the crests of the Buzdag, Elm and Abikh mud volcanoes (Ginsburg et al, 1992; Dadashev et al., 1995) in water depths of 480 m, 660 m and 600 m, respectively.

AB  - AbstractThe conditions at which methane and water form solid hydrates have beenextended from 4,000 to 11,200 pounds per sq. in. The curve at high pressure hadbeen in doubt because of Villard's report of a critical decompositiontemperature. The paper explains the nature of the hydrate curve at highpressure and its dependence on fluid phase behavior. Extropolation of themethane hydrate curve indicates a pressure of 40,000 pounds per sq. in. willcause hydrates to form at a temperature of 100? F.IntroductionThe conditions under which natural gases form hydrates when liquid water ispresent have been studied by several investigators up to pressures of about4,000 pounds per sq. in. The early work by Villard on hydrates of methane andethylene, ethane, and propane included references to critical decompositiontemperatures of the hydrates. Villard's work raised the question as to whetherthe pressure-temperature curve for methane-water hydrate continued above atemperature of 70.7?F. or whether this was the maximum temperature at whichhydrates would form.This paper extends the experimental data on methane hydrate to 11,200 poundsper sq. in. A discussion of phase relations in the hydrate region for thehydrocarbons and of the methane-water system at high pressures isincluded.Previous WorkVillard suspected that methane hydrates could not be formed at temperaturesabove 21.5?C. (70.7?F.) irrespective of the pressure of the liquid-vaporsystem. However, he was limited in his studies by his apparatus in 1888 topressures not greater than 300 atmospheres (4,410 pounds per sq. in.) so thatthere has remained some doubt as to the existence of such a maximum temperaturein this region.For the case of ethylene hydrates, however, Villard does specifically state theoccurrence of what he terms a "critical temperature for the decompositionof the hydrates."T.P. 2579

AB  - Abstract Gas hydrates in reservoirs are generally not in thermodynamic equilibrium and there may be several competing phase transitions involving hydrate. Formation of carbon dioxide hydrates during aquifer storage of carbon dioxide involves roughly 10% volume increase compared to groundwater. Dissociation of hydrate towards under saturated fluid phases involves the same level of contraction. Hydrate phase transitions are generally fast (scales of seconds) compared to mineral dissolution and precipitation and it is unlikely that a time shifted explicit coupling to geo mechanical analysis will be able to capture the appropriate dynamic couplings between flow and changes in stress. The need for geo mechanical integrity of the storage site therefore requires a reservoir simulator with an implicit solution of mass flow, heat flow and geo mechanics. And since carbon dioxide involved in hydrate is also involved in different geochemical reactions we propose a scheme where all possible hydrate formation (on water/carbon dioxide interface, from water solution and from carbon dioxide adsorbed on mineral surfaces) as well as all different possible dissociations are treated as pseudo reactions but with kinetics derived from advanced theoretical modeling. The main tools for generating these models have been phase field theory simulations, with thermodynamic properties derived from molecular modeling. The detailed results from these types of simulations provides information on the relative impact of mass transport, heat transport and thermodynamics of the phase transition which enable qualified simplifications for implementation into RCB. The primary step was to study the effect of hydrate growth or dissociation with a certain kinetic rate on the mechanical properties of the reservoir. Details of the simulator, and numerical algorithms, are discussed and relevant examples are shown. Introduction Natural gas hydrate in the reservoir is continuously attracting the attention of more researchers around the world and the reason is its importance from different aspects ranging from a potential energy resource to environmental threat. Hydrate can occur in sediments below the oceanic floor or in the permafrost wherever the thermodynamic conditions are suitable and water and guest molecules are available. Investigations show that there are huge resources of natural gas hydrate in the earth which due to the high volumetric concentration of methane gas per hydrate volume is considered as a substantial energy resource. Besides, methane combustion releases less CO2 per unit energy release compared to both coal and oil which means a cleaner fuel from environmental point of view. On the other hand methane can be over twenty times more aggressive than CO2 in trapping the heat in the atmosphere and in case of leakage from sediments it can affect the marine life and the climate substantially. There are several scenarios for methane production from natural gas hydrate reservoirs. Depressurization method in which hydrate stability condition is disturbed by pressure reduction according to the water-gas-hydrate equilibrium curve of figure 1 resulting in hydrate dissociation and release of methane. It is currently considered as the most feasible process considering expenses and production rate and has been investigated by many research groups through simulation studies. Thermal stimulation is another method which is based on moving out from stability region by temperature increase. It is considered to be costly due to huge amount of energy waste to the surroundings. The third method is to use inhibitors such as methanol or brine to shift the equilibrium curve and dissociate hydrate according to figure 2 which is also costly. The final method is injection of CO2 into the methane hydrate reservoirs. CO2-hydrate is more stable than Ch4-hydrate. Therefore CO2-hydrate formation will provide the necessary heat to dissociate methane hydrate and it can be considered both as a natural gas production method and a CO2 sequestration process (Graue et al., 2008).

AB  - AbstractWhile it is important to approach each system individually when dealing with new types of performance chemicals, the anti-agglomerants have been found to be suitable for hydrate control in most of the situations encountered in offshore oil production. Anti-agglomerants have now been used in several field applications in deepwater systems - both in subsea wells and dry tree wells - under both flowing and shut-in conditions. During these applications, no hydrate problems were observed. The anti-agglomerants caused no upsets in the topsides operations; there were no emulsion problems, no foaming problems, and no water quality problems. The products were deployed through the existing methanol injection systems without incident. Application rates were significantly lower than if methanol were used. Potential advantages of the anti-agglomerants over methanol include smaller umbilicals, smaller pumps, smaller storage facilities, and less frequent supply trips.IntroductionThe formation of natural gas hydrates is the most universal of the many flow assurance challenges faced during production of oil and gas from deepwater reservoirs. As noted by Mehta, et. al.,1 deepwater production conditions are ideal for the formation of hydrates. Thus there is a need to improve both the system design and operating procedures.Although the existence of gas hydrates was recognized by Davy2 nearly two hundred years ago, it took over a hundred years before their formation was recognized as a problem in gas transmission lines.3 Gas hydrates are essentially compounds of water in which the gas molecules play, both figuratively and literally, only a supporting role. Without this support, however, the whole structure collapses. To understand gas hydrates, water must be understood first. The physical properties of water are dominated by the formation of hydrogen bonds between water molecules. Hydrogen bonds are much weaker than chemical bonds, yet much stronger than the dipole-dipole interactions (van der Waals forces) that allow most materials to form condensed phases. Without the existence of hydrogen bonds, water would be a gas that would be more difficult to liquefy than carbon dioxide, oxygen or nitrogen. One of the most recognized peculiarities of water is the fact that it expand on freezing. This clearly shows that solid water has a more "open" structure than liquid water. While rare, this phenomenon is not nearly as unusual as the fact that the density of water increases as it is heated from 0°C to 4°C. This behavior shows that this open structure, which is the result of hydrogen bonding, persists in liquid water.4When water freezes it releases an extraordinary amount of heat as additional hydrogen bonds are formed. Clearly the formation of solid water is energetically favored, but it is opposed by the strict order (entropy) that is created by its formation. Gas hydrates form because the gas molecules dissolved in the water help support an open, ordered system thereby allowing a solid water phase to form at a higher temperature. The action of the gas is primarily related to its space filling geometry. Molecules of similar size contribute similarly to the stability of the gas hydrate. This model is supported by the fact that the standard entropy of solution for the series of hydrocarbons from methane to butane increases in absolute magnitude as the size of the molecule increases.5 This implies that larger molecules create more order.

AB  - AbstractIn this paper we investigate experimentally the effect of surfactants on the formation kinetics of methane hydrate. The compounds tested include: anionic, cationic and nonionic surfactants. Experimental results indicate that surfactants (at concentrations levels near their CMC) do not influence the thermodynamics, however, they have a strong influence on the kinetics of gas dissolution in the water phase as well as on the overall rate of hydrate formation. In addition, the formed hydrate particles in the presence of the various surfactants exhibit diverse agglomeration characteristics. This work is part of an overall effort to develop the technology required for the safe operation of offshore oil and gas transportation pipelines without inhibitors. IntroductionUndersea oil and gas transportation pipelines in cold waters are often under thermodynamically suitable conditions for the formation of gas hydrates. Traditionally, the industry has designed pipelines and processing facilities to operate outside the hydrate formation pressure-temperature region. This is accomplished by the addition of inhibitors or by the dehydration of the gas/condensate fluids. However, this approach may be prohibitively expensive for offshore pipelines. We believe that a more economical approach is to allow the hydrates to form, and consider their transportation in the form of a slurry, where the formed particles neither deposit nor agglomerate. This paper addresses this problem by investigating experimentally the effect of surfactants on the formation kinetics as well as the physical characteristics of methane hydrate particles formed in the presence of surface active compounds. Surfactants are substances that when they present even at very concentrations, have the ability to significantly alter the surface or interfacial free energies. Therefore, surfactants should have a direct effect on the hydrate formation process. The formed nuclei in the presence of surfactants should have a different critical radius and hence, a higher surface area per unit volume of the system. The later may have a significant effect on the global formation rate under certain regimes of operation. Surfactants form colloidal-size clusters in solutions called micelles. The critical micelle concentration (CMC) is the minimum concentration of the dissolved surfactant above which the clusters (micelles) begin to appear in the solution. At CMC an abrupt change occurs in almost every physical property that depends on the size or number of particles in solution. This behavior is true for all types of surfactants - nonionic, anionic, cationic and zwitterionic - in aqueous solutions. The maximum reduction in surface tension occurs at CMC. As a result we decided to examine the effect of surfactants on hydrate formation kinetics when they are present near their CMC levels. The compounds tested include: anionic and nonionic surfactants. Freezing point depression experiments with thirteen surfactants showed that they do not have any measurable influence at concentrations near their CMC. P. 375^

AB  - ABSTRACTNatural gas hydrate is found worldwide in sediments of outer continental margins of all oceans and in polar areas with continuous permafrost. There are currently 77 localities identified globally where geophysical, geochemical and/or geological evidence indicates the presence of gas hydrate. Details concerning individual gas-hydrate occurrences are compiled at a new world-wide-web (www) site (http://walrus.wr.usgs.gov/globalhydrate). This site has been created to facilitate global gas-hydrate research by providing information on each of the localities where there is evidence for gas hydrate. Also considered are the implications of gas hydrate as a potential (1) energy resource, (2) factor in global climate change, and (3) geohazard.INTRODUCTIONInterest in naturally occurring gas hydrate has increased steadily since about 1969 when Vasil''ev et al. (1970) recognized that natural gas could form gas-hydrate deposits that should occur globally wherever the pressure and temperature conditions are favorable. Recognition of the potential for natural gas-hydrate occurrence was followed by its discovery, first in permafrost regions of northern Russia (Makogon et al., 1971, 1972). It was then observed in sediment of the Black Sea (Yefremova and Zhizhchenko, 1974) and inferred by seismic surveys to be present in sediment of the Blake Ridge, in the western Atlantic Ocean (Stoll et al., 1971; Ewing and Hollister, 1972). By the early 1980s, gas hydrate had been found in outer continental margin sediment of the Middle America Trench offshore from Mexico (Shipley and Didyk, 1982) and Guatemala (Harrison and Curiale, 1982). Since then, the rate of discovery of evidence for gas hydrate has accelerated. The early history of discovery of gas hydrate has been summarized by Kvenvolden (2000). EVIDENCE FOR GAS HYDRATE Three kinds of evidence have been used to identify the presence of natural gas hydrate--geological, geochemical, and geophysical.

AB  - Hydrate reservoirs that are partly exposed towards the ocean floor will not be unconditionally stable even though the local temperature and pressure may be sufficient to maintain equilibrium among pure methane, water and hydrate. In this work we study the stability limits with respect to methane concentration in the seawater in contact with the hydrate. Since the average methane concentration in the oceans is very close to zero, the hydrate will not be thermodynamically stable when exposed to this seawater. The estimated driving forces for dissociation are limited, and the dissociation rate is expected to be correspondingly small. Accurate estimates for the dissociation kinetics in a system with these small driving forces require accurate values for the interfacial tensions as well as other rheological properties involved in the kinetics of dissociation, and the transport of heat and melted molecules away from the hydrate/seawater interface. Work is in progress on the estimation of these properties using molecular simulations. I have also presented a nucleation theory for the kinetics of hydrate formation and growth based on multi-component diffusive interface theory. Theoretical estimates indicate that methane hydrate initiation from the gas side of the gas/water interface may dominate when compared to initiation and growth from the liquid side of the interface. INTRODUCTION One of the problems involved in the modelling of the kinetics of hydrate formation is that many pieces of the mechanisms involved in the total formation process for water and hydrate former to hydrate are still unknown. Basically we might say that the kinetic problem can be divided into 2 main stages, initial nucleation and stable growth. The nucleation stage is related to that of forming hydrate cores that are thermodynamically stable and as such will grow steadily. The actual content of these 2 stages, and in particular the nucleation stage, of the formation process in terms of mechanisms and corresponding detailed kinetic contributions remains experimentally unverified today.

AB  - Abstract The traditional method of managing hydrates in production systems has been complete avoidance. This methodology comes at a high cost of insulation to maintain fluid temperature beyond the hydrate formation temperature and/or chemicals to prevent hydrates from forming. This paper will present methods to assess hydrate formation/plugging tendencies and manage the system in a manner that allows for reduction in insulation requirements and/or chemical usage. ExxonMobil's Upstream Research Company (EMURC) has developed a unique hydrate slurry model based on experience gained in the laboratory and field applications. Cold restarts are different than allowing fluids to remain cold indefinitely (i.e. cold flow) in that the hydrates form for a period of time before the system eventually comes out of the hydrate formation region in "steady-state/normal" production. This presentation will show how the model is used to assess hydrate blockage potentials by integration with a transient multiphase flow simulator. This enables the model to predict amounts of hydrates that form and couple the formation with flow dynamics such as shear conditions, phase fractions, and dispersion characteristics which influence the probability of a hydrate blockage forming. The model has been applied successfully to several applications by assessing various cold restart strategies in which significant cost savings have been realized through the reduction of insulation requirement and/or chemical usage – in some instances it has allowed for the extension of field life.

AB  - This presentation was an SPE Distinguished Lecture during 2004-2005.AbstractGas hydrates, or clathrate hydrates, are ice-like crystallinecompounds, which form through a combination of water and suitably sized ‘guest'molecules under suitable temperature and pressure conditions. They looklike ice, but unlike ice they can form at temperatures well above icepoint.In petroleum exploration and production operations, gas hydrates are aserious economic and safety concern. They can cause partial or totalblockages in pipelines and processing facilities. They are a serioushazard in deepwater drilling, which can potentially block the BOP stack, killlines and chokes, obstruct the movement of the drill string, and cause seriousoperational and safety concerns.In the 1960's it was recognized that considerable quantities of gas hydrate,mainly methane hydrate, occur naturally in the sediments of subsea continentalslopes, and in the subsurface of Arctic permafrost regions. Since thisdiscovery, there has been an increased global interest in natural gas hydrates,with research being driven by a number of factors. These include thepotential for methane hydrates as strategic energy reserve (currently estimatedat twice that of total fossil fuels), the possibilities for CO2sequestration, subsea landslide and tsunamis, the potential dangers posed todeepwater drilling and installations, pipelines and subsea cables, hydratestability and methane (a potent greenhouse gas) release and its effect onglobal climate changes. However, gas hydrates are not all bad news, asthey can have many positive applications, due to their very interestingproperties. They can be used for separation, storage and transportationof oil and gas, CO2 separation and sequestration, watertreatment. They could also have many applications in agriculture, food,pharmaceutical, and medical industries.In this presentation, the various positive and negative aspects of gashydrates are discussed. The presentation will cover the necessaryconditions for gas hydrate formation, their interesting properties, theirformation in sediments, their potential as a source of low carbon fuel, theireffect on global climate changes and glacial periods, subsea landslide andmethane release, as well as some of their positive applications. However,the lecture will focus on flow assurance aspects of gas hydrates, discussingapplied methods for predicting their formation conditions, and techniques usedfor detecting and dissociating hydrate plugs. The lecture will concludewith some case studies.

AB  - AbstractNew, cost-effective, and environmentally acceptable hydrate inhibitors that allow multiphase fluids to be transported untreated over long distances have been under increasing investigation by the oil and gas industry.Replacing traditional hydrate inhibitors such as methanol and glycols with a new generation of hydrate inhibitors can lead to very substantial cost savings, not only for the reduced cost of the new inhibitor but also in the transportation costs and the size of the injection, pumping and storage facilities. Thus it is possible to redesign production facilities on a smaller scale. Such a change-over in hydrate inhibitor technology may also be an environmental requirement in the near future.We will present an overview of patent and other literature on new hydrate inhibitors, including specific chemicals that have been investigated. Our own results on some of these published chemicals will be given and their applicability compared. We will also present data on new inhibitors developed at RF, as well as improved methods of evaluating their activity. A discussion of the relative merits of the two main types of new hydrate inhibitor, "kinetic inhibitors" and "antiagglomerators", will be given.IntroductionThe cost of preventing hydrate formation either by pipeline insulation or by using thermodynamic inhibitors (THIs) such as methanol can be an important economic factor to consider when developing small to medium fields.Kinetic inhibitors (KIs) have been proposed as an alternative chemical treatment to THIs. However, the main drawback with KIs is their limited activity. The best KIs published to date appear only to have applications down to ca. 7-8 C subcoolings into the hydrate region if one is considering multiphase transportation over a reasonable distance. This subcooling effect is equivalent to using ca. 15-18 wt.% methanol. However, the KIs discovered to date are far from structurally optimised, and there are probably other classes of KI that remain to be discovered that are effective at higher degrees of subcooling. Hence, research on KIs is justified on this basis. Even so, improvements to be made in KI activity may still not good enough for some applications at extremely low temperatures or high pipeline pressures. Therefore, as the oil industry needs to control hydrate formation at very high subcoolings, a third method of chemical treatment is being developed. These types of chemicals are called Anti-Agglomerators (AAs).Besides chemical treatment and the use of pipeline insulation, other hydrate control methods include using a jacket of hot water injected from the platform side, and using electric heating cable wrapped around the pipe. Neither technique has a track record yet.Hydrate inhibitors and their ApplicationThe three chemical methods for preventing hydrates from blocking pipelines can be summarised as follows:Thermodynamic Inhibitors (THI). These are added at high concentrations (10-60 wt.%) and alter the chemical potential of the aqueous or hydrate phase so that the hydrate dissociation curve is displaced to lower temperatures or higher pressures. Examples are methanol and ethylene glycol.Kinetic Inhibitors (KI). These are added at low concentrations (<1 wt.%) and do not affect the thermodynamics of hydrate formation. However, they do delay hydrate nucleation and/or crystal growth. When the inhibition mechanism breaks down and fast, auto-catalytic hydrate formation begins, the hydrate agglomerates rapidly and can form a plug.Anti-Agglomerators (AA). These are also added at low concentrations (< 1 wt.%) and prevent the agglomeration of hydrates so that all the hydrate crystals are transportable and do not build up in the pipe.P. 529

AB  - Understanding gas hydrates as an alternative energy source is of increasing interest to the oil and gas industry. Gas hydrates are formed from a combination of water and natural gas and are commonly found in offshore shallow seabed sediments and arctic areas. More specifically, they are formed in areas that are conducive to high pressure and low temperature where water and gas can combine to create a solid ice-like substance.The authors review the current and developing techniques in the area of gas hydrate reservoir formation evaluation. In particular, they delve into the physical responses of the resistivity, nuclear, acoustic, and nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR logging measurements. Key items discussed are the estimation of hydrate saturation; hydrate growth habits and their identification from log data; and the relevancy of such information to possible reservoir exploitation.The paper emphasizes the importance of an integrated approach; i.e., the combination of various log measurements gives a far clearer picture than can any one single measurement. For example, a combination of density and NMR measurements have been shown to be useful in determining hydrate saturation while a combination of the acoustic well log velocities and hydrate saturation can help determine the hydrate growth habit.

AB  - AbstractThe kinetic and thermodynamic inhibition of gas hydrates occurs by disruption of the hydrogen bonding process that otherwise leads to clustering of water molecules as a solid lattice. Consequently, and in order to design better inhibitors for gas hydrates, it is of utmost importance to understand the mechanisms that lead to the formation of gas hydrates.The interaction of the hydrate forming molecules with the water molecules at the onset of hydrate formation is re-examined in light of the results of NMR and X-ray diffraction data, and the statistical mechanics models. This re-examination shows that the large cages of structures I and II hydrates are almost always preferentially occupied regardless of the molecular size of the hydrate former. In other words, the large cages 512 62 and 512 64 of the hydrate structures, I and II, dominate the hydrate nucleation process.IntroductionGas hydrates are solid inclusion compounds similar to ice in appearance but differing in crystal structure. However, their structure is still considered as a derivative of the ice structure. Under favorable conditions of high pressure and low temperature, water physically entraps the molecules of a hydrate former inside a hydrogen-bonded solid lattice. The hydrate former could be in a vapor or a liquid state, miscible or immiscible with the water. Over 100 molecules have been identified as clathrate hydrate formers with water. Among those are the natural gas components N2, H2S, CO2, C1, C2, C3, and iC4. Larger molecules like nC4 require a helper gas to form hydrates. The weak van der Waals type interaction of the entrapped molecules with the water molecules gives the structure its thermodynamic stability. Three crystal structures have been identified for hydrates. These are structure I, structure II, and the more recently identified structure H. A wealth of hydrate phase equilibrium and growth kinetics data has also been accumulated. This was accompanied by the development of the statistical mechanics model of van der Waals and Platteeuw which introduced the first quantitative method to predict the equilibrium conditions of gas hydrates based on their crystal configuration. Despite these important milestones, much is yet to be learned about the molecular mechanisms with which hydrates form. On the other hand, molecular simulation provided important insight about the water-water and guest-water interactions within the hydrate structure. It was also used to determine the interactions of an apolar molecule with its hydration shell in dilute aqueous solutions of the former. Nevertheless, molecular level understanding for the phase transition process of clathrate hydrates is still in preliminary stages.P. 169^

AB  - AbstractFrom one perspective, the pursuit of unconventional resources, including gas hydrate, is completely unnecessary. Worldwide the proven reserves of conventional gas are enormous - in excess of 6,000 TCF - and have doubled over the past 20 years. In 2004 these reserves represented 67 years of consumption. In addition, large new conventional discoveries are still being made. This leads to the question: Why bother with gas hydrate as a resource? To answer that question we must consider gas hydrate in the broader context of natural gas supply and demand. In locations with large reserves and few consumers, natural gas is virtually a worthless byproduct of petroleum operations. Throughout the twentieth century large volumes of gas have been flared or vented for lack of a viable market. While this practice is decreasing due to environmental considerations, nearly 10 BCF of gas continues to be flared or vented worldwide each day. Where there are no pipelines connecting supply to demand, the economics of natural gas are far different from those of oil. Without pipelines, oil is still very easy to transport by ship. Transporting natural gas by ship requires its liquification (and then the regasification of the LNG at a receiving port). This is an expensive process, although with increased experience, the costs associated with the LNG process have dropped significantly in the past 5 years. Indeed, many in industry see LNG as the solution to the natural gas needs of the industrial world. The expansion of LNG markets challenges the viability of unconventional gas resources. The expansion of other conventional gas operations also impacts the future of unconventional resource development. For the United States, new pipelines from the Alaskan and Canadian Arctic and the expansion of infrastructure in the Rocky Mountains may significantly decrease the need for unconventional gas. The pipeline capacity for natural gas in the deepwater Gulf of Mexico is so constrained that the National Petroleum Council has reported that there will be no room for gas from hydrate for 20 years. These issues present a challenge to any unconventional gas resource. In spite of these obstacles, a realistic case can be made for unconventional gas, including gas hydrate. First, there is a growing gap in Canada and the United States between wellhead delivery and consumption. The combined gas production of the US and Canada appears to have peaked in 2002 and is declining at an annual rate of 6%. Meanwhile demand in the United States is increasing. The National Petroleum Council projects the demand to increase from the current 23 TCF/year to 30-34 TCF/year by 2025. LNG will play an important role in filling the gap between supply and demand, yet an over-reliance on LNG raises a number of concerns as well. First, is the vulnerability of supply. Most of the large and growing conventional gas reserves available for export are in unstable regions of the world - the Middle East, the former Soviet Union, Southeast Asia, and West Africa.

AB  - This paper discusses some possible contributions of methane hydrates to global change, especially as the result of global warming. INTRODUCTION Gas hydrates are metastable minerals whose formation, stable existence and decomposition depend upon pressure, temperature, composition and other properties of the gas and water. Hydrates are inclusion compounds, or solid solutions, in which water is the solvent. Molecules of water are joined together by hydrogen bonds to form a lattice which contains large cavities, molecules of gases or volatile liquids are absorbed by incorporation into those cavities. Some hydrate properties are unique. For example, one cubic meter of hydrate contains 164.6 m3 of methane measured at standard conditions, which in hydrate state occupies a volume of only 0.2074 m3 . The specific volume of the hydrate solid is 26 to 32% larger than that of water, compared with a 9% increase for the transition from water to ice. As a result, crystallization at constant volume can produce pressures up to 300 MPa. Conversely, the pressures of free methane gas resulting from dissociation of the solid hydrate at constant volume in a closed container can be as large as 80 to 100 MPa. Gas hydrates commonly form in oil and gas wells and pipelines. As a result, most of the practical interest to date has been directed towards the prevention or removal of hydrates in oil and gas production equipment. The existence of hydrates in nature was proved in the 1960''s (Makogon, 1965; 1966). Natural gas hydrates are among the most widespread minerals present on our planet in a metastable state. Because the main components of the natural gas hydrates are water and methane, these hydrates represent a tremendous potential source of mineral energy for future applications. However, more than 98 % of the naturally occurring hydrates are located under the seas, primarily in continental shelf-oceanic slope transition zones.

AB  - Abstract Flow Assurance continues to remain a major challenge in offshore production operations. Current methods for avoiding gas hydrate problems are generally based on one or a combination of the following three techniques: (1) injection of thermodynamic inhibitors (e.g. methanol, ethylene glycol) to prevent hydrate formation, (2) use of kinetic hydrate inhibitors (KHIs) to sufficiently delay hydrate nucleation/growth, and (3) maintaining pipeline operating conditions outside the hydrate stability zone by insulation and/or active heating and/or by controlling pressure.1 However, for many production operations, particularly deepwater fields, those requiring long tiebacks, and mature reservoirs (where water cuts can be very high), the above techniques may not be economical and/or logistically practical. Thus the industry needs novel and improved techniques to tackle flow assurance problems for such challenging conditions. The new approach presented in this paper -HYDRAFLOW- aims to meet this need. HYDRAFLOW is a novel ‘cold flow' concept, which breaks from the tradition of straightforward hydrate prevention. Instead, gas hydrate formation in pipelines is intentionally induced and managed, eliminating the need for expensive thermal/chemical inhibition while improving the economics and practicalities of multiphase fluid transport. Experimental analyses of low and high GOR systems for various different production scenarios with and without AA (Anti-agglomerant) have been undertaken as part of HYDRAFLOW concept development. The effect of simulated shut-in on fluid transportability has also been tested. A new experimental set-up for measuring the viscosity of the fluid system under high-pressure conditions has been designed and commissioned in order to evaluate the rheology of the systems under investigation. Results prove that the concept is viable (at least under laboratory conditions), and strongly suggest that HYDRAFLOW technology could offer significant benefits over existing flow assurance strategies, providing a novel low CAPEX/OPEX solution for challenging (e.g. deepwater, long tie-backs, mature fields) operations. Introduction Generally, most of the existing gas hydrate flow assurance techniques are based on avoiding solid hydrate formation. This is normally achieved by either reducing water content, reducing heat loss to the environment (e.g. by insulation and/or active heating) or the injection of thermodynamic and/or kinetic hydrate inhibitors. However, all of these approaches have limitations, particularly in the case of deepwater operations, high water cuts (e.g. mature fields) and/or long tieback systems. As forecasted by ITI Energy, global oil and gas production is increasingly being dominated by exploitation of mature fields, meaning existing techniques - which are more geared to new developments (lower water cuts) - are becoming less practical/economic.2 Thus the requirement for alternative strategies is expected to continue to increase in the future. HYDRAFLOW is a new, patented flow assurance technology, which aims to meet this need. The concept of HYDRAFLOW is to be able to transport oil/gas without any thermal (i.e. insulation or active heating) or high dosage chemical treatment, thus greatly reducing the costs of multiphase hydrocarbon pipeline transport. The absence of thermal and/or major chemical treatment means HYDRAFLOW falls under the umbrella of ‘cold flow' technologies.

AB  - ABSTRACT Natural gas hydrate sediments are a significant worldwide methane resource. Their presence below and at the seafloor, however, also presents a potential hazard through possible destabilisation and methane release. Such a process could have consequences for seafloor slope instability and seafloor installations, as well as global change. Our current understanding of the petrophysics of hydrate sediments is largely derived from experimental and theoretical studies of pure hydrate, and from limited observations of hydrate core and in-situ log measurements. Improved understanding of the nature and stability of hydrate sediment is urgently required. The instability of natural gas hydrate sediments at ambient conditions necessitates the use of specialised laboratory investigations. Proposals to sample hydrates using pressure coring techniques and sample transfer chambers on- board ship are, however, in place and technical developments to enable these are well advanced. There is, however, a need to try to characterise the nature and extent of any gas hydrate within the pressurised sample prior to depressurising, opening and subsampling. The ability to petrophysically characterise gas hydrates remotely while still in the pressurised core barrel may provide a route to detailing their physical extent and nature. With this objective, experiments to manufacture a range of synthetic gas hydrate morphologies in a range of sediments in the laboratory are in progress. To date we have succeeded in manufacturing a range of both pure and sediment-hosted CO2 hydrates as a prelude to manufacturing methane hydrates. Continuing experiments are developing a range of geometrical and internal structures and fabrics (from massive to disseminated) using different sediment-hosts. These generic hydrate groups will provide a basis for non-invasive characterisation of hydrate morphologies. From these results protocols will be established to guide the geophysical logging of natural sediment- hydrate core maintained under pressure in lab transfer chambers on board a drillship, using the hyperbaric GEOTEK Core Logger. This will enable the characterisation and classification of sampled hydrates. While new insight will be gained into geophysical modelling of hydrate behaviour, it will also guide the development of sampling programs, prior to depressurising and initiating dissociation. This will allow detailed planning of shipboard scientific work utilising these rare and precious samples. This new knowledge will provide an improved basis for petrophysical analysis of hydrate sediments, enhance geophysical survey data, and better constrain estimates of in-situ hydrates. It will also provide improved data for evaluating the stability of hydrate sediments and their potential for environmental change.

AB  - Abstract With the movement of offshore rigs into deep water, the problem of gas hydrates has become an important issue in drilling. If a kick is taken, gas hydrates can form in the BOP (Blow Out Preventers) or choke lines while circulating out the kick. A water-based pill formulation has been developed which is a significant improvement over current formulations for inhibiting gas hydrates. This pill can be spotted in the BOP to alleviate much of the concern for the formation of gas hydrates. The pill is environmentally safe, can be weighted up, and is easily adaptable to offshore operations. It is compatible with commonly used drilling fluids and can be incorporated directly into the mud system after removing the kick. The technology discussed represents an important safety consideration for deep water drilling well control operations. Summary and Introduction In recent times, Shell's drilling operations have moved into record-setting water depths (7,000 ft +) in the Gulf of Mexico, where sea-bed temperatures can dip close to the freezing point of water. As one ventures into deeper waters, the ambient conditions at the sea-bed (38°F, 4000 psia) become very conducive for hydrate formation. Lower temperatures and higher hydrostatic pressures both favor hydrate formation. For shallow water and on-shore wells, one typically considers hydrate formation due to produced water being present. In deep-sea drilling, the water-based drilling fluids are prone to form hydrates under such deep-sea environmental conditions. Several adverse effects may result. Exxon has reported the formation of natural gas hydrates during drilling operations at two different domestic offshore sites. In both instances, the hydrates plugged subsea equipment causing considerable difficulties in subsequent operations. Potential difficulties in subsea operations include: Formation of a gas hydrate plug in the ram cavity. Formation of an annular plug between the drill string and the BOP (Blow Out Preventers). Plugging of the choke and kill lines. Plugging at or below the BOP.

AB  - Abstract Gas hydrates have been identified as a possible future hydrocarbon resource. Within the exploration industry various projects have been established to further understand and advance this frontier concept. This presentation will give an overview of results from a recent global basin screening of gas hydrates. The main objective was to define and rank the world's most prospective areas. A conventional exploration risking approach was used to evaluate and risk both offshore and onshore basins for hydrocarbon source, gas migration pathways, reservoir properties and sealing capabilities of the sediments. Seismic data, well logs and other relevant data including public domain data have been analyzed. Approximately 500 onshore and offshore basins have been evaluated and ranked, several of which reveal good to very good gas hydrate potential. Data examples are presented to outline the approach taken in more detail and to illustrate some of the characteristics of typical prospective gas hydrate accumulations. Based on the results of this study, we believe we have localized some of the more interesting "sweet-spots" from an industry perspective. Technological developments, the gas price and the continued increase in demand for energy will define if and when these resources will be exploited on a large scale.

AB  - AbstractThis paper examines hydrate stability against changes in seasonal weather, sediment slumps, sea-level fluctuations with time, glacial conditions, and topographic changes with time. The purpose is to determine longevity of hydrate accumulations with geological time and to determine their impact on geological regions and stability. The results indicate that stable geological conditions are not always the best locations for hydrates-dynamical changes can lead to higher hydrate production and retention. The significance is that the perturbation of potential hydrocarbon accumulation sites by hydrate appearance and disappearance, together with the variability of the potential worth of the hydrate accumulations themselves, may play a more important role than so far recognized in evaluation of economic worth.I. Overview of General Hydrate Dissociation Conditions.The presence of clathrates (gas hydrates) is well established observationally in the offshore region of the South Caspian Basin, as well as in many other regions of the world. Hydrates of given composition can exist under particular pressuretemperature conditions. However, under the impact of neotectonic processes, those conditions can change. In that case part, or all, of the mass of hydrates can be dissociated and released. The dissociation can take place gradually, or explosively, depending on how fast the pressure drops or temperature increases.Five major variations of hydrate evolution are considered to illustrate possible patterns of behavior caused by variation of geological conditions: Variations in hydrate existence conditions due to sediment and mud redeposition. Due to earthquakes, volcanic eruptions or other processes, part of the sediments can be released from a sloping sea bottom and transported and redeposited in other places, thereby changing pressure conditions at the top of a hydrate layer. Variations in hydrate existence conditions due to glacial-interglacial conditions. Removal of ice cover not only decreases overlying pressure, but also allows water temperatures overlying the sediments to increase. Variations in hydrates due to sea level rise and fall. Enrichment of ethane in hydrates as a consequence of varying neotectonic conditions. Evaporation and reformation of hydrates in aeolian conditions due to winter cooling and summer heating.Hydrates can cause an explosive hazard for exploration rigs, production platforms and pipelines, especially in deep water conditions. All of the above geological patterns of instability should, therefore, be kept in mind when potential hazards are assessed. In addition, flame initiation by dissociation is also examined as a potential hazard, as are hazards due to drill penetration, warm circulation mud, and drill-bit heating of hydrates.In many areas of the world the prevalence of gas hydrates at the present-day, or inferred to have been present in the recent past, is one of the more influential factors in controlling geological sedimentation and attributes allied to the geological behavior. For instance, in the Green River Basin, Wyoming, the ENRON Corporation (1993) has estimated that a total gas (possibly some in hydrate form) reserve of 5,000 TCF exists; while in the eastern United States, offshore South Carolina, there are estimates available of major hydrates present, with associated contributions to dynamical instability (Lowrie, 1997).

AB  - AbstractCarbon dioxide (CO2), which is one of the most abundant compounds on Earth, is present in rock, the oceans and the atmosphere. CO2 influences many biological and dynamic processes. Carbon dioxide is very soluble in water due to its high dipole moment. Solubility of a gas in water is dependent upon the temperature and pressure. This dependence affects the changing content of gases in the atmosphere, and the variable effect that certain gases have on the climate. Currently, many believe that the effect of CO2 on global warming exceeds 50% of the combined effect of all greenhouse gases. CO2 is present as a gas, or can be dissolved in water, or can be found in a solid state. CO2 can also exist in a solid state as a clathrate hydrate.Gas hydrates are known as metastable minerals, whose composition and properties are determined by the source components, temperature and pressure. Knowledge of the conditions of formation, stability and decomposition of CO2 hydrate with seawater and the mass ratios of gas and water during phase transition appears quite important. In this paper, we present the results of laboratory work concerning the kinetics and morphology of a CO2 -seawater system at pressures up to 50 MPa and temperatures of 268-295 K. Measurements of CO2 solubility in supercooled seawater before and after hydrate formation are discussed. The conditions of CO2 hydrate formation and stability in seawater that is under-saturated with gas are described. The research results reveal a number of details concerning hydrate formation and dissociation, including the limits of dissolved gas in water for stable conditions of gas hydrate crystals in the water volume. Also, the information can be used to interpret the role of gas hydrates in the global changes on our planet. The results of this work permit to determine the most effective technologies to control the content of CO2 in the atmosphere. We cannot include all of our results in this paper, due to the volumes of research data generated on this subject. However, many of our most important findings have been included and discussed.General Information About The CO2 And Seawater Used In This WorkThe following gas and liquids were used during the experiments.Gas: Carbon dioxide (99.9% CO2 + 0.04% CH4 + 0.06% N2 )Liquids: Salt (sea) water - standard laboratory mixture containing 41.953 g/L sea-salt composition (meets American Materials Standard D-1141-52 Formula A) mixed with distilled water.Table 1 presents the composition of the sea salt used to mix the synthetic seawater .The density of the seawater that we mixed in the laboratory was 1.025 g/cm3 at 15 °C. Of course, the density of seawater will depend upon the temperature, pressure and salinity of the liquid. For atmospheric pressure, the density of seawater as a function of temperature and salinity is illustrated in Figure 1 (improved, from Sea Water: Its Composition, Properties and Behavior).

AB  - Abstract Current oil prices have shifted the offshore flow assurance philosophy from "hydrate avoidance" to "hydrate management". In order to manage hydrate formation in the pipeline, not only do we need to have a good understanding of the hydrate formation process, but also a comprehensive hydrate formation predictive tool is necessary. In this work, a transient hydrate simulation tool coupled with a multiphase flow simulator, which predicts the hydrate formation rate and amount to determine hydrate slurry transportability, is applied to assess the hydrate formation risk in an offshore gas condensate subsea tieback under design stage. A simulation model is developed using the geometry, fluid properties and predicted production data from this field. This gas condensate field has an offshore separator that connects to a subsea production line. After separation, gas and liquids are transported by export lines. In this study, the hydrate formation in the production and the liquid export lines was estimated using the transient hydrate simulation tool. Simulation studies were performed to assess the hydrate plugging risk at both steady state and transient operations considering different water cuts. This simulation tool has been demonstrated to be useful in modeling hydrate management during subsea pipeline design and optimization, and can provide guidelines for safe and cost-effective hydrate management in the field.

AB  - ABSTRACTThe objective of this work is to qualitatively describe the primary nucleation of gas hydrates from water on a molecular ''level. At the present time, no such hypothesis exists in the literature. The onset of hydrate formation cannot be predicted because hydrates are complex solids that go through a metastable region upon cooling; thus, it is important to come to a qualitative understanding of hydrate formation on a microscopic level. I It is postulated that the concept of metastability, for which hydrates I are infamous, is directly determined by primary nucleation phenomena. To better understand the cause for metastability involved in this process, it is useful to review I what is known about the structure of water. Thus the work serves to consider hydrates at one end of the spectrum of water structures. The theoretical basis for the hypothesis and some experimental data are provided in support. Confirmation or falsification of the hypothesis will b:e the topic of future work. INTRODUCTIONThe goal of determining hydrate kinetics is to predict hydrate formation in order to prevent the plugging Of flow channels (e.g. deepwater pipelines, well choke and kill lines, ,etc.) by hydrate masses. Thermodynamic work performed in the past indicates when hydrates might form, but due to the metastable nature of gas hydrates, thermodynamics cannot predict the time when hydrates actually will start forming under the appropriate conditions. Thus kinetic studies are crucial to understanding what causes gas hydrates to be metastable compounds. Gas hydrate formation is a crystallization process which is characterized by two distinct regions, namely primary nucleation and the growth stage. The primary nucleation region is the process wherein a subcritically sized crystal may either grow or shrink before becoming a stable crystal.

AB  - AbstractA number of numerical simulation studies of gas hydrate reservoirs have indicated that the pressure reduction method known as depressurization is a promising technique to produce gas from hydrate reservoirs. In some cases, severe ice formation has been observed, leading to plugging and termination of gas production. Some researchers have suggested that if the flowing bottomhole pressure is not lowered beyond the equilibrium pressure corresponding to the freezing point of water, then ice formation may be avoided. This argument is based on the premise that the lowest temperature would occur at the wellbore. If temperature can be controlled to above zero by controlling the bottomhole pressure, then freezing should not occur. The objective of this work is to explore under what conditions ice particles form. Various cooling mechanism (cooling because of decomposition, gas expansion, etc) are studied in detail. For this purpose, a 3D mathematical model for gas production from hydrate reservoirs is introduced which incorporates energy balance, fluid flow and kinetics of the hydrate decomposition along with the ability to predict the formation of ice particles. This model is developed by modifying the GPRS (General Purpose Reservoir Simulator) platform to account for a number of mechanisms including hydrate decomposition and ice formation. GPRS is an object oriented reservoir simulator code developed at Stanford University. We will then apply this simulator to model largescale hydrate decomposition process in porous media, and demonstrate the effect of ice formation on gas production behavior. Through some case studies we investigate the conditions in which ice forms and becomes an issue. The learning for these studied are then used to suggest practical ways of avoiding ice formation. Introduction Hydrate particles are made up of natural gas molecules trapped in water molecule structures, and are considered as a potential resource for clean energy. Enormous quantities of methane gas exist in the form of hydrate in the permafrost and offshore environments. Large resources of hydrate have been explored worldwide including the North West Territories of Canada, Siberia, Alaska and Japan. In the last two decades much interest and research has been devoted towards the mathematical modelling of gas production from hydrate reservoirs. Three general techniques have been suggested to recover gas from hydrate reservoirs which are all based on breaking the stability conditions of hydrate leading to generation of gas; Depressurization, Thermal Stimulation and Inhibitor Injection. While depressurization does not require an external source of energy and is based on propagation of pressure drop from the wellbore to the hydrate decomposition zone, the thermal stimulation technique needs an external source of energy, not unlike those applied in the thermal recovery of heavy oils. Efficiency and economics of these techniques is the subject of numerous investigations. The first attempts to model hydrate formation and decomposition go back to the works done in the first decades of 1900's which aimed at preventing hydrate formation in the gas transportation pipes. Exploration of hydrate reservoirs and their potential as a new resource for energy has resulted in more research activities in the last two decades.

AB  - SummaryThe stability of a natural gas hydrate during storage at atmospheric pressure and below-freezing temperatures was studied in the laboratory. The gas hydrate was produced in a stirred vessel at 2- to 6-MPa pressure and temperatures from 0 to 20°C. The hydrate was refrigerated and stored in deep freezers at -5, -10, and -18°C for up to 10 days. The natural gas hydrate remained stable when kept frozen at atmospheric pressure.IntroductionThe formation of natural gas hydrates is a well-known problem in the petroleum and natural gas industries. Hydrates are solid materials that form when liquid water and natural gas are brought in contact under pressure. The problem arises when hydrates deposit in pipes and equipment, causing blockage and pressure drop. Removing liquid water, injecting methanol, increasing temperature, and decreasing pressure are methods used to remove and prevent hydrate formation in pipeline systems.Hydrate formation need not be a problem. On the contrary, it can be an advantage. The volume of hydrates is much less than that of natural gas. At standard conditions, hydrates occupy 150 to 170 times less volume than the corresponding gas. Typically, natural gas hydrates contain 15% gas and 85% water by mass. It follows that hydrates can be used for large-scale storage of natural gas. Benesh proposed using hydrates to improve the load factor of natural gas supply systems. He suggested that hydrates could be produced by bringing liquid water into contact with natural gas at the appropriate temperature and high pressure. The hydrate then would be stored at a temperature and pressure where it was stable. When gas was needed for the supply system, the hydrate would be melted at low pressure.In Benesh's example, it was assumed that a natural gas hydrate was produced at about 10°C and 3.5 MPa. To remain stable at atmospheric pressure, the hydrate would need to be stored at a subzero temperature (about - 32 ° C). The idea was that the natural gas hydrate must be stored at a pressure and temperature at or above equilibrium.

AB  - Summary. With the movement of offshore rigs into deep water, the problem of gas hydrates has become an important issue in drilling. If a kick is taken, gas hydrates can form in the blowout preventer (BOP) or chokelines while the kick is circulated out. The water-based pill presented here significantly improves gas-hydrate inhibition. This pig, which can be spotted in the BOP and weighted up, is environmentally safe and easily adaptable to offshore operations. Compatible with commonly used drilling fluids, the pig can be mixed directly into the mud system without any adverse effects after the danger of hydrate formation diminishes. This technology is an important safety consideration for deepwater drilling well control and hydrate-free operations above the mudline. IntroductionShell Oil Co.'s drilling operations have recently moved into record-setting water depths >7,000 ft) in the Gulf of Mexico, where seabed temperatures are near the freezing point of water. In deeper waters, the ambient conditions at the seabed (38deg.F and 4,000-psia hydrostatic pressure) are conducive to hydrate formation. Hydrate formation in shallow-water and onshore wells usually results from the presence of produced water. Several adverse effects may result. Barker and Gomez reported the formation of natural-gas hydrates during drilling operations at two domestic offshore sites. In both instances, the hydrates plugged subsea equipment, causing considerable difficulties in subsequent operations. Potential difficulties in subsea operations include (1) formation of gas-hydrate plugs in the ram cavity, (2) formation of annular plugs between the drillstring and the BOP, (3) plugging of the chokelines and kill lines, and (4) plugging at or below the BOP. We defined the following criteria for the development of a successful pill formulation. 1. The spotting fluid must inhibit the formation of gas hydrates for anticipated well conditions in 7,000 ft of water in the Gulf of Mexico (hydrostatic pressure=4,000 psia, well pressure=6,000 psia, and temperature=38deg.F). 2. The fluid must be compatible with a 20 % sodium chloride/ partially hydrolyzed polyacrylamide polymer mud system and/or other water-based mud systems. 3. The fluid should be capable of supporting mud weights up to 14 lbm/gal. 4. The fluid should have low toxicity, with an LC. bioassay value greater than 30,000 ppm. 5. The fluid must be nonflammable. We developed a salt/glycerol-based spotting fluid that meets an these requirements. This paper describes our R and D. Gas-Hydrate Theory Gas hydrates in drilling and production operations consist of cagelike water lattices that entrap gas molecules. Methane, ethane, propane, n-butane, i-butane, hydrogen sulfide, nitrogen, and carbon dioxide are well-known hydrate-forming components. Hydrocarbons that are heavier than butanes do not form hydrates. Natural-gas hydrates form two distinct, mutually exclusive structures. Structure hydrates form a body-centered cubic cell; Structure 2 hydrates form a diamond lattice. Structure formation depends on the components in the gas stream. Light gases-e.g., methane, hydrogen sulfide, carbon dioxide, and ethane-form Structure 1 hydrates. Heavier components,, propane, n-butane, and i-butane-form Structure 2 hydrates. Nitrogen was initially thought to form Structure I hydrates but now is reported to form Structure 2 hydrates. The literature shows that even. small amounts of propane and heavier components produce Structure 2 hydrates. In our study, we focused on typical Gulf of Mexico gas compositions that cause Structure 2 hydrate formation. Another important consideration is the amount of gas trapped in the hydrate structure. Just 1 ft of hydrate can contain as much as 170 scf of gas. When hydrates dissociate, this gas is liberated. If it is released in a closed environment, pressure can increase con-siderably.he phase equilibria of gas hydrates have been studied extensively, and results are reported in the literature. The formation of hydrates depends on the gas composition (i.e., the gas specific gravity). As the gas becomes heavier, the temperature and pressure requirements for hydrate-free operations become more severe. At an isothermal condition, a hydrate-forming heavy component (e.g., n-butane) forms hydrates at pressures lower than those at which lighter components (e.g., methane) form hydrates. Similarly, at an isoboric condition, a hydrate-forming heavy component forms hydrates at temperatures higher than those required by lighter components. The composition of the aqueous phase and the presence (or absence) of a condensed hydrocarbon phase can affect the hydrate formation's pressure and temperature. Because temperature and pressure conditions are predefined and because water content cannot be reduced economically at mudline, the aqueous-phase composition is adjusted to suppress hydrate formation. Solutes within the water phase (e.g., salts, alcohols, and glycols) provide good hydrate inhibition. Also, such solutes often depress the freezing point of water. Freezing-point measurements are more readily made experimentally than gas-hydrate-formation measurements. In our study, we obtained the freezing points experimentally and used them to determine gas-hydrate formation/inhibition with our computer-modeling study. Computer Model We developed a computer model based on freezing-point data to study the formation and inhibition of gas hydrates in the presence of salt/glycerol/water mixtures. The solvent activity (i.e., water activity) may be calculated from freezing-point-depression data. For our model, we used the Moelwyn-Hughes equation: ...............................................(1) where aw, = water activity, Tf = mixture freezing point, and Twf = water freezing point (273.16 K). Eq. I follows from the general thermodynamic relationship. ...............................................(2) where as = solvent activity, Lf= solvent latent heat of fusion at Tsf, C = CpL - Cpcr = difference m constant-pressure heat capacities of liquid solvent and crystal, Tsf = freezing point of pure solvent, and R = gas constant. To derive Eq. 1 from Eq. 2, we must assume that C is constant over the temperature range of freezing-point depression. In a strict thermodynamic sense, one may do so for only a limited composition range of the solute in water. We relaxed this constraint and assumed that this relationship would apply to concentrations approaching 60 wt% glycerol in water. Note that the nature Of the inhibitor does not affect functional relationship between water activity and freezing point. SPEDE P. 109^

AB  - Since their initial discovery in the 1960’s, gas hydrates have been considered to be an important potential source of unconventional natural gas. Significant progress has been made relative to our understanding of the geologic and engineering controls on the ultimate energy potential of gas hydrate; however, more work is required to realize the promise of gas hydrates as a future energy source. Gas hydrates have been encountered, recovered or inferred to exist in numerous sedimentary basins in Arctic permafrost settings, regions of alpine permafrost, marine sediments of outer continental margins and in deep lakes. Despite the great abundance of potential gas hydrate resources in the world, a large portion of these resources reside in clay-rich sediments and fracture dominated reservoir systems, and are not generally considered producible with existing technology, but may have future potential with the emergence of new technologies. For a large portion of the world, gas hydrate in sand reservoirs have become a viable production target and the focus of the first production testing efforts. Production tests in Arctic Canada (Mackenzie Delta) and Alaska have shown that gas can be produced from highly-concentrated gas hydrate accumulations in coarse-grained (i.e., sand rich) reservoir systems with conventional production technologies. Production can be achieved through the depressurization method and by more complex methods such as molecular substitution (e.g., CO2-CH4 exchange). In 2013, the gas hydrate production test was conducted in a marine setting in the offshore of Japan. An additional test was conducted in Japan in 2017 to further evaluate alternative well completion technologies. Also in 2018, China initiated a 60-day gas hydrate production test in the Shenhu region of the South China Sea. This report reviews the results of gas hydrate engineering and production testing studies associated with the Mallik, Mount Elbert, and Iġnik Sikumi projects in northern Canada and Alaska. The results of the marine gas hydrate producing testing efforts in the Nankai Trough (Japan) and in the South China Sea (China) are also summarized.

AB  - Abstract Deepwater natural gas hydrate resources potentially exceed all other conventional and non-conventional hydrocarbon resources on a world-wide basis. However, before these offshore gas hydrate resources can be classified as reserves, it must be demonstrated that gas hydrates can be produced under conditions that make economic sense. The purpose of this paper is to provide an overview of the technical issues that will challenge the development of deepwater natural gas hydrates.

AB  - Quantitative prediction of gas hydrate formation risk is critical for the successful implementation of risk-based approaches to hydrate management in subsea production. Here we use a high pressure, stirred, automated lag-time apparatus and a high pressure acoustic levitator to experimentally obtain smooth probability distributions describing stochastic hydrate formation. Robust, repeatable hydrate nucleation and growth rate probability distributions as a function of induction time and subcooling are measured for various gases, shear rates and inhibitor dosages in systems with interfacial areas ranging from (0.1 to 60) cm2. The results reveal that new engineering models can be used to reliably predict hydrate formation probability. Importantly these new models have solid theoretical foundations which enables them to be generalized with confidence to industrial systems.

AB  - AbstractOceanic methane hydrate and associated gases occur in continental slope marine sediments in very large quantities. Current interest is being driven by the economic potential of these methane deposits. But their affect on the global carbon cycle and climate change, seafloor stability and safety, plus the influence on the biological food chain have only begun to be resolved. Survey, observation, measurement, and sampling methods must be developed specifically for hydrate system deposits as all occur in the upper 1.5 km of the seafloor in relatively similar marine sediments. Some instrumentation can already characterize these deposits; application of geophysical equipment should be directed toward the range of physical properties common to hydrate system deposits at the target depths. I IntroductionConcentrations of gas hydrate that extend over large areas are now being recognized widely in continental slope sediments virtually on a global scale1. Both single and multichannel seismic reflection surveys have revealed hydrate2,3 through the presence of the strong impedance contrast reflector at the base of the hydrate - the bottom simulating reflector or BSR. This is normally seen where free gas is present beneath the hydrate2, 3. Large scale surveys using relatively high resolution side-scan sonar acoustic imagery of the seafloor have revealed pockmarks, mud diapirs and mud volcanoes that are often related to methane gas flux4, 5. These surveys have also mapped large scale slope disturbances and sediment mass wasting often attributed to gas hydrate instability6, 7. Larger scale failures appear to correlate with regions of higher gas hydrate occurrence, at least on the European margins8. However this relationship can be tenuous in some localities, such as in the Mediterranean Sea, where gas hydrates are not known to occur widely9. This illustrates the need for better measurement of gas hydrate distribution in both area and depth.To date these wide-area survey techniques have been serendipitous in their revealing of the presence of oceanic hydrate system diagenetic features in that they were tuned to explore deeper geophysical - geological features10. The acoustic systems and processing were usually designed to reveal hydrocarbon exploration targets or crustal features of scientific interest. Methane gas flux and oceanic hydrates however, are confined to the uppermost 0.5 to 2 km of marine sediments, with hydrate methane resource issues focusing at between 200 and 800 m depth in the seafloor. The impact of hydrate on seafloor stability, safety and the environment may be confined to the top few hundred meters of sediment. A commercially successful strategy for methane production does not yet exist though Japan has stated their resources are on the brink of being considered as reserves. Therefore it is pragmatic to consider effective survey logistics for characterizing the various hydrate issues. This is relevant irrespective of whether gas hydrate is of commercial interest in its own right, is an environmental and engineering hazard, or an acoustic layer of scientific interest within the seabed. This paper considers the two important modes of gas hydrate occurrences and defines the current technology that can be used to effectively measure, or at least map, its distribution on the continental margins of the world's oceans. We propose an outline for survey and monitoring requirements for seafloors in which gas hydrate occurs.

AB  - ABSTRACTHydrate reservoirs that are partly exposed towards the ocean floor will not be unconditionally stable even though the local temperature and pressure may be sufficient to maintain equilibrium between pure methane, water and hydrate. In this work we study the stability limits with respects to methane concentration in the seawater in contact with the hydrate. Since the average methane concentration in the oceans is very close to zero the hydrate will not be thermodynamically stable when exposed to this seawater. The estimated driving forces for dissociation are limited and the dissociation rates is expected to be correspondingly small. Accurate estimates for the dissociation kinetics in a system with these small driving forces requires accurate values of the interracial tensions as well as other rheological properties involved in the kinetics of dissociation and transport of heat and melted molecules away from the hydrate/seawater interface. Work is in progress on the estimation of these properties using molecular simulations. I have also presented a nucleation theory for the kinetics of hydrate formation and growth based on multi-component diffusive interface theory. Theoretical estimates indicate that methane hydrate initiation from the gas side of the gas/water interface may dominate when compared to initiation and growth from the liquid side of the interface.INTRODUCTIONOne of the problems involved in the modelling of the kinetics of hydrate formation is that many pieces of the mechanisms involved in the total formation process for water and hydrate former to hydrate is still unknown. The nucleation stage is related to that of forming hydrate cores that are thermodynamically stable and as such will grow steadily. The actual content of these two stages, and in particular the nucleation stage, of the formation process in terms of mechanisms and corresponding detailed kinetic contributions remain experimentally unverified today.

AB  - Abstract CO2/CH4 exchange in a sandstone-hosted methane hydratereservoir was executed in the field, following several years of laboratoryexperimentation.  Reservoir simulation and laboratory data informedfieldtrial design, including use of a cell-to-cell model that included correctliquid/vapor/hydrate phase behavior of methane, carbon dioxide, nitrogen, andwater. Most concepts for producing methane from hydrate deposits rely ondepressurization, heating, or chemical melting.  These techniques resultin dissociation of hydrate into its water and gas constituents.  Effectiveexchange of CO2 for CH4 in the crystalline hydratelattice, without dissociation, was long deemed an improbable recovery strategybecause experimental results on bulk hydrate samples indicated very slowreaction kinetics.  Recent laboratory tests documented enhanced exchangekinetics and efficiency, attributed to the increased surface area present inporous media.  A series of laboratory tests ranging from simple gas-richsystems to more complex gas-deficient / water-rich systems guided the design ofa field test program.  Ignik Sikumi #1 was drilled in 2011 on the AlaskaNorth Slope, designed specifically for testing CO2/CH4exchange in hydrate-bearing sandstones. Ignik Sikumi #1 was drilled vertically with chilled oil-based mud to a depthof 2600ft.  Four hydrate-bearing sandstones were encountered, andpetrophysical evaluation indicated the Sagavanirktok "C Sand" hosted thehighest hydrate saturations.  These sandstones occur in the subsurface atreservoir conditions similar to temperatures and pressure conditions of labtests.  Reservoir modeling with conventional simulators and in-housecell-to-cell models guided both equipment design and test parameters. Anticipated low injection rates and cryogenic injectant required the design ofspecialized pumping equipment.  Operations at Ignik Sikumi #1 re-commencedin December 2011.  Following perforation, over 200,000 scf of mixedCO2/N2 gas was injected.  A short unassisted flowperiod was followed by extended production testing via jet pumping. Results from the production test will be shown. CO2/CH4 exchange is a novel approach to recovermethane from sandstone-hosted hydrates.  Field trial has validatedlaboratory results and reservoir simulations, and has proven thatCO2 can be injected into naturally occurring sandstone-hostedhydrates.  Subsequent flowback/drawdown testing produced injectants(nitrogen, carbon dioxide, and tracer gases) methane, water, and very finesand.

AB  - The evaluation of gas hydrate resource potential continues to spread across the globe. Over the past decade, exploration emphasis has steadily shifted away from the confirmation of the presence of gas hydrate to the more complex issue of prospecting for specific accumulations of highly-concentrated gas. In general, concepts for gas hydrate exploration have evolved from a search for bottom-simulating reflectors to a process much more akin with conventional oil and gas exploration that features the direct detection of gas hydrate accumulations in seismic data supported by integrated geological/geophysical/geochemical studies that address issues of gas supply and reservoir distribution. This report aims to assimilate the lessons learned to date to outline a general exploration procedure for gas hydrate resources and outline remaining research challenges as follows: 1) delineation of the gas hydrate stability zone; 2) the identification and evaluation of strong amplitudes of the same polarity as the sea-floor (“peak” amplitudes) within that interval, as well as intervals of increased acoustic velocity; 3) mitigation of the geologic risk inherent in such prospects via seismic mapping of amplitude distribution along prospective horizons as well as broader seismic facies analyses; and 4) further risk mitigation through assessment of evidence of gas presence and gas migration into the gas hydrate stability zone.

AB  - Summary Gas hydrates in reservoirs are generally not in thermodynamic equilibrium, and there may be several competing phase transitions involving hydrate. Formation of carbon dioxide (CO2) hydrates during aquifer storage of CO2 involves roughly 10 vol% increase compared with groundwater. Dissociation of hydrate toward undersaturated fluid phases involves the same level of contraction. Hydrate phase transitions are generally fast (scales of seconds) compared with mineral dissolution and precipitation, and it is unlikely that a time-shifted explicit coupling to geomechanical analysis will be able to capture the appropriate dynamic couplings between flow and changes in stress. The need for geomechanical integrity of the storage site therefore requires a reservoir simulator with an implicit solution of mass flow, heat flow, and geomechanics. And because CO2 involved in hydrate is also involved in different geochemical reactions, we propose a scheme where all possible hydrate formation (on water/CO2 interface, from water solution, and from CO2 adsorbed on mineral surfaces) and all different possible dissociations are treated as pseudoreactions, but with kinetics derived from advanced theoretical modeling. The main tools for generating these models have been phase-field-theory (PFT) simulations, with thermodynamic properties derived from molecular modeling. The detailed results from these types of simulations provides information on the relative impact of mass transport, heat transport, and thermodynamics of the phase transition, which enable qualified simplifications for implementation into RetrasoCodeBright (RCB) (Saaltink et al. 2004). The primary step was to study the effect of hydrate growth or dissociation with a certain kinetic rate on the mechanical properties of the reservoir. Details of the simulator and numerical algorithms are discussed, and relevant examples are shown.

To be able to predict the hydrate particle size distribution and the hydrate coat behaviour, a population balance equation has been coupled to a gas-water-solid transient transport model. Special care has been taken to describe the different kinetic and physical processes that affect the crystal sizes distribution and the flow pattern.

AB  - Abstract Recent hydrate assessments from the Ocean Drilling Programme (ODP) and the Mallik Test site have advanced the techniques of hydrate detection and evaluation. Transfer, and some modification, of these techniques to the routine evaluation of hydrates as a deepwater geohazard is now needed. Early detection of a hydrate geohazard can be achieved by the integration of seismic, wireline and sampling data before full evaluation proceeds. Proxy identifiers of hydrates are established and seismic and wireline data, particularly where used in tandem, are proving effective at locating hydrate risk. Recent infra-red spectral core logging has shown the potential for identifying a hydrate signature in non-pressurized cores. No single proxy method of measurement is totally effective at identification and none, as yet, appears reliable at quantifying the absolute values of hydrate concentration and critical porosity. At our present depth of knowledge, a pressurized core recovery programme is required to obtain this objective data. Introduction Indications of hydrates have now been found worldwide in practically all deepwater with suitable temperature and pressure regimes. Production from hydrates has been achieved below permafrost caps in Siberia and at the test site at Mallik in the McKenzie Delta. Dealing with a potential geohazard starts with the decision of whether to mitigate or avoid the hazard. With the growing evidence for the widespread occurrence of hydrates, avoidance may not always be an option. Locating and evaluating a hydrate hazard will continue to depend initially on proxy methods of measurement and identification. The challenge now is to calibrate and integrate these proxy measurements with absolute values. The shallow gas risk of hydrates is present at all concentrations but the other major risk caused by the development of overpressures occurs when the hydrate dissociation increases the effective porosity of the formation above the critical porosity. The critical porosity is the level above which the pore fluid becomes load bearing. Porosity, ?, and the fraction of the pore space occupied by hydrate:- the hydrate concentration, ?, are thus the key measurements for assessing the hydrate hazard. Locating the hydrates Bottom Simulating Reflectors. The primary proxy indicator of hydrates is the identification and recognition of a Bottom Simulating Reflector (BSR). Potentially a BSR indicates the interface of the gas hydrate stability zone (GHSZ) with the free gas zone beneath. For assessment of the hydrate hazard the BSR has four drawbacks. Firstly, the hydrate BSR must be separated from other potential BSRs. Secondly, a number of observations have confirmed that hydrates can be present without a BSR. Thirdly, the BSR is just the bottom limit of the GHSZ so the vertical extent of the hazard can only be inferred by estimating temperature/pressure conditions and from theoretical hydrate stability envelopes. Lastly, a travel time seismic survey provides no absolute values that can be used to approximate the hydrate content of the sediment. It has been observed that BSRs appear to be sharper in some areas than others but this need not reflect varying concentrations of hydrate.

AB  - AbstractGas wells located in Southern Alberta, Canada pose challenges for well operators. High bottomhole pressure in new wells, low bottomhole temperatures and Joule-Thompson expansion cooling effect often lowering gas stream temperatures to below brine freezing create favorable conditions for formation of gas hydrates in the wells and transportation pipelines. The problems are aggravated during cold winter months when wells and pipelines have strong tendencies to plugging with hydrates and ice. Operators experience significant monetary losses due to disrupted production and have to spend considerable amount on chemicals and time to clean up hydrates from plugged wells and pipelines.With subcooling temperatures often exceeding 14°C, kinetic hydrate inhibitors are incapable of preventing hydrates formation. A typical solution to such severe hydrate problems is pumping massive amounts of methanol or glycols to the well and production lines. Adding large amounts of thermodynamic inhibitors creates problems by itself like oxygen corrosion or solvent induced scaling.Earlier work in the field indicated a possibility of synergism between thermodynamic hydrate inhibitors and Low Dosage Hydrate Inhibitors (LDHI). Systematic laboratory work was undertaken to explore possible synergistic effects between methanol and LDHI. A strong synergistic effect was discovered at a certain ratio of methanol and low molecular weight oligomer type hydrate inhibitor. These observations allowed a formulation of a superior hydrate inhibitor. Field results show the reduction up to 80% of the original and often insufficient methanol dosages. Due to this novel approach to hydrate problems, the operator experienced more trouble-free field operation and increased gas production, improved economics with less down time, lower total cost of chemicals and delivery.IntroductionGas hydrates form when water molecules crystallize around guest molecules. The water/guest crystallization process has been recognized for several years, is well characterized and occurs with sufficient combinations of temperature and pressure.1 Light hydrocarbons, methane-to-heptanes, nitrogen, carbon dioxide and hydrogen sulfide are the guest molecules of interest to the natural gas industry. Depending on the pressure and gas composition, gas hydrates may build up at any place where water coexists with natural gas at temperatures as high as 80°F (~30°C). Gas transmission lines and new gas wells are particularly vulnerable to being blocked with hydrates.Formation of gas hydrates can be eliminated or hindered by several methods. The thermodynamic prevention methods control or eliminate elements necessary for hydrate formation: the presence of hydrate forming guest molecules, the presence of water, high pressure and low temperature. The elimination of any one of these four factors from a system would preclude the formation of hydrates. Unfortunately, elimination of these hydrate elements is often impractical or even impossible. Transmission lines heating and insulating is a common mechanical solution to hydrate problems often encountered in long subsea pipelines. Hydrates will never form if the gas/water system is kept above the hydrate formation temperature. Gas dehydration is another method of removing a hydrate component. However, in a practical field operation, water can be economically removed to a certain vapor pressure only and residual water vapors are always present in a dry gas. Hydrate plugs in "dry" gas lines have been reported in the past2.The addition of chemicals to the gas/water streams is the most common method of preventing hydrate formation. Large amounts of alcohols, glycols or salts are being utilized. These additives thermodynamically destabilize hydrates and effectively lower the temperature of hydrate formation. They function by bonding to water molecules through hydrogen bonds or solvation.

AB  - ABSTRACT:Triaxial tests with controlled temperature and confining pressure have been carried out on artificial samples of methane hydrate to determine the mechanical properties for the purpose of studying extraction methods and related stability problems. The results confirm that the strength of methane hydrate increases at low temperatures and high pressures. INTRODUCTIONIn recent years the extraction of methane hydrate as a possible source of hydrocarbon energy is being investigated. Natural gas produces low quantities of greenhouse gases such as carbon dioxide compared with oil or coal and thus its use is increasing. Methane hydrate is a solid hydrated form of natural gas which is found at the edge of tectonic plates. In this hydrated form methane molecules are surrounded by a cage of water molecules. This form of methane is stable at low temperatures however under high pressures it can be stable even at elevated temperatures in excess of 0°C. Thus methane hydrate can be found to occur naturally in deep sea bed conditions or permafrost 1). In 1999 methane hydrate extraction trials were first carried out offshore in the Nankai trench close to the Omaezaki Cape in Shizuoka prefecture. Using oil exploration techniques this was the first time that methane hydrate was extracted from the seabed 2). Although there has been considerable research on the physical chemical properties of methane hydrate the mechanical properties have yet to be fully investigated 334)5)6). It is important to know these properties in order to allow the extraction of this material under stable conditions. Some uniaxial compression tests have been carried out under low temperature conditions’p) however it is important to establish the stability of methane hydrate under varying temperatures and pressures. Thus the work described in this paper was aimed at determining the mechanical properties of this material under varying conditions.

AB  - ABSTRACTThere is a growing interest in natural gas hydrate mainly due to the possibility that it may represent a large energy resource, potentially have an impact on global climate change and play a role in submarine slope failures. It is therefore of great importance to be able to identify the occurrence of in-situ gas hydrates and accurately assess their volume within the host sediments. The evaluation of gas hydrate volumes is dependent on a number of parameters, including the areal extent of the hydrate occurrence, reservoir thickness, porosity of reservoir and degree of hydrate saturation. Normally in hydrocarbon exploration of conventional oil and gas fields, the analysis of core samples, obtained while drilling, are used to evaluate this petrophysical data. However, because hydrate disassociates and loses gas as it is brought up to normal surface temperatures and pressure, it becomes problematical in obtaining meaningful porosity and saturation values from recovered cores. Therefore, downhole well logging techniques are used in order to obtain petrophysical data. These techniques have, in the main, been adapted from the standard hydrocarbon industry methods of determining porosity and saturations using resistivity and acoustic log data, together with the deterministic relationships such as the Archie (resistivity) and Wyllie (acoustic) time average equations. Deterministic formation evaluation methods follow a step-by-step approach to arrive at one solution for each depth step. In successive steps, the lithology, porosity, and saturations are determined. Thus the analytical parameters are fixed and the solutions unique. Another approach has been to use probabilistic statistical software such as the Mineral Solver module within the Interactive Petrophysics™ software package. Probabilistic evaluation, computes a solution from an assigned mineral model and all the available logs simultaneously, using statistical methods. This probabilistic method has been applied to log data acquired from the ODP/IODP (marine) and the Mallik (permafrost) exploration wells, successfully generating gas hydrate saturation estimates, with comparable results to Archie saturation estimates at high saturations. Further investigation is required to fully determine the potential of probabilistic methods for gas hydrate evaluation.INTRODUCTIONSome of the significant questions for gas hydrate research include: Where do the gas hydrates occur? How much gas hydrate is there? Why and how do gas hydrates occur in particular geological settings?Well logging and subsequent log analysis form crucial roles in answering some of these questions, particularly in evaluating the quantity of gas hydrates present in hydrate bearing sediments.Gas hydrates are combinations of water and natural gas that, under certain conditions of high pressures and low temperatures, form solid, ice like substances, forming as cement in the pore spaces of sediment (Figure 1) as well as in layers and nodules of pure massive hydrate (Booth et al., 1998; Clennell et al., 2000; Camps et al., 2006). They naturally occur within a limited range of pressures and temperatures, found in some ocean sediments and in on-shore sediments of the permafrost regions of the Arctic (Kvenvolden et al., 2001).

AB  - ECONOMIC USE OF HYDRATES: DREAM OR REALITY G.A.Cherkashev and Research Institute for Geology and Mineral Resources of the Ocean "VNIIOkeangeologia", V.A.Soloviev St.Petersburg, Russia Abstract The importance of natural gas hydrates as a potential fossil fuel is a subject of much current interest. However, it is still impossible to unambiguously answer the question "Economic use of hydrates: dream or reality?". We lack sufficient knowledge and the required stage of research work has not been accomplished yet. Most of the gas hydrate occurrences in the World Ocean (42 of 64) has emerged from indirect features, mainly from observations of the Bottom Simulating Reflector (BSR). The nature of BSR cannot be indicative of particular gas hydrate accumulations but only justify the gas hydrate prone areas. The available global estimates of gas amount in natural gas hydrates differ by more than four orders of magnitude (1.8·1014 to 7.6·1018 m3). Most of the published estimates are overestimated, because they are based on a paradigm formed at the early stage of research and it states that submarine gas hydrates are marked by a continuous distribution over large areas and at a wide range of subbottom depths and by a high hydrate content of deposits. These considerations do not comply with observational data, namely, has hydrates show discrete occurrence as isolate accumulations. The estimates 1.8·1014 to 1·1015 m3 seem to be most realistic. In future gas hydrate accumulations related to fluid discharge areas will probably be more feasible resource. Such accumulations occur on the immediate sea floor and they are marked by a relatively high hydrate content of deposits. Therefore, we have all the ground to suggest that gas resources in hydrates of these accumulations are renewable. Introduction The first reliable discovery of gas hydrates took place less than a quarter of a century ago: they were reported and described from the Black Sea in 19741 and Caspian Sea in 19792. The intense study of natural gas hydrates especially during the last decade was caused by several reasons. Gas hydrates are considered as a potential fossil fuel; as a source atmospheric emission of greenhouse gas; as a factor affecting instability of continental and island slopes; as an environment component complicating the economic activity during the development of the offshore natural resources. Globally, the interest to natural gas hydrates as a possible energy source capable to deficit of hydrocarbons in the future was stirred up primarily by a huge amount of gas in hydrates mentioned in numerous published estimates. However, the estimates differ by several orders of magnitude implying uncertainty concerning the real extent of gas hydrates in the earth interior, primarily submarine. All the other issues related to natural gas hydrates are considered to be secondary to the above mentioned. The paper 1) provides an overview and analysis of observations of gas hydrates and their features

AB  - Abstract Years of research and development, as well as field experience has moved the hydrate management philosophy towards less conservative operations. Previously, the standard was to avoid gas hydrates altogether. Now, on the other hand, the industry is more often looking into how to "live with hydrates" meaning that they are willing to accept the risk of hydrate formation given that there are enough evidence that the hydrates will not plug the pipeline. This paper presents some of the experimental techniques and methods used to realize an effective hydrate management strategy by investigating hydrate properties with regard to plugging and possible slurry transport.

AB  - Abstract The Natural Gas Hydrate Program Expedition (NGHP) has been formed to explore and develop the gas hydrate resources of Indian subcontinent in three stages. The first stage was to identify the presence of gas hydrate deposits in Indian Offshore Basins and the second stage was to identify gas hydrate in sand rich geological setting within gas hydrate stability zone and suitable locations for production testing. During the second stage, 42 gas hydrate wells at 25 sites were completed in deep water areas of Krishna Godavari and Mahanadi offshore in Eastern Coast of India. This paper provides an insight into formation evaluation techniques as effective tools of evaluating gas hydrate saturation. During the second stage of the expedition; LWD, wireline well log data and pressure cores were acquired and they have been used for estimation and validation of gas hydrate saturations. The gas hydrate saturation have been estimated by three methods viz., standard deterministic Archie method, probabilistic method using ELANPlus model and Density Magnetic Resonance (DMR) technique. This paper also emphasizes the estimation of gas hydrate saturation considering gas hydrate as a part of matrix in the ELANPlus model and validation with pressure core results. In Petrophysical model, hydrate can be considered either as a pore-filling hydrocarbon (fluid) or as a matrix mineral (rock constituent). When it is assigned as a pore-filling hydrocarbon, the model calculates the matrix volumes & porosity and calculates the water saturation in the same way as the basic interpretation model. When the hydrate is considered as a constituent of the matrix in the model, hydrate volume is calculated and the hydrate saturation is then arrived at by dividing this volume by the total porosity. Hydrate is invisible to Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR) measurements. In DMR technique, the deficit in NMR porosity as compared to Density porosity is used to estimate the hydrate volume accurately. Gas hydrate saturation estimation in one of the well drilled during the second stage of the expedition from Krishna Godavari basin is discussed in detail in this paper. Gas hydrate saturation estimated from DMR method is found to be close agreement with other methods such as deterministic Archie and ELANPlus based probabilistic methods. The gas hydrate saturation is found to be in the range of 20-60% in the considered well. The results have been validated with gas hydrate saturation obtained from pressure cores retrieved from the nearby core hole. The present approach is to estimate gas hydrate saturation with different methods and validation with pressure core data to minimize uncertainty in estimation of petrophysical parameters for such type of unconventional reservoirs.

AB  - Abstract Unrestricted fluid flow of oil and gas streams is crucial to the petroleum industry. Unless preventative action is taken, gas hydrate plugs form under the high pressure, low temperature conditions inherent to offshore production. The oil and gas industry is facing increasing costs in inhibiting gas hydrate formation due to the development of offshore gas reservoirs. Recent international estimates of the cost of the conventional inhibitor, methanol, alone are in excess of $150 million/year. Gas hydrates are likely to form in subsea flowlines unless the water is removed down to the lowest dew point encountered, highly effective insulation is in place, or inhibitors are used. Since complete stripping of water from condensates and/or natural gas is prohibitively expensive, and effective insulation is beyond current economic limits, the most effective solution includes the use of hydrate inhibitors.This paper describes the state of the art of hydrate prevention, detailing hydrate structure, conditions and mechanisms of formation, and developing approaches - from the conventional to the cutting-edge - to hydrate inhibition. Its focus on low-dosage inhibitors, including a review of kinetic inhibitors and anti-agglomerants form, function, development, selection, modeling and applications, highlights gaps in current knowledge. Finally, a research agenda addressing both mitigation and deployment strategies is proposed.INTRODUCTIONSince the 1930's when Hammerschmidt1 determined that the material plugging pipelines was gas hydrates, interest in gas hydrates has continued to increase. Hammerschmidt's discovery led to the regulation of the water content in natural gas pipelines2. In 1934, Hammerschmidt published a correlation summary of over one hundred hydrate formation data points.Unrestricted and problem-free flow of petroleum products during extraction, processing, and transportation is essential to the oil and gas industry. Whether heavy hydrocarbons such as crude oil, or low molecular weight hydrocarbons such as natural gas and natural gas liquids are the target end product, natural gas is almost always present in the fluid extracted during production. To varying degrees (most often low early in the life of a reservoir and high toward the end), the extracted oil and gas mixture also contains water. In the presence of water, and under a fixed range of pressure and temperature conditions, specific to each hydrocarbon mixture, hydrates of the light gases can form. Gas hydrates, which have a crystalline structure analogous to that of ice, form solid plugs and block the flow. Clearly, inhibition of hydrate formation is of utmost interest to industry. Hydrate formation is a substantial problem in deepwater production and underwater pipelines, which transport condensed phase hydrocarbons such as gas condensate or crude oil. In these situations, once plugs have formed, there are limited possibilities for removal2.Since the 1970's, the oil and gas industry has faced increasing costs associated with inhibition of gas hydrate formation, due to the development of offshore gas reservoirs. Recent international estimates of the cost of the conventional inhibitor, methanol, alone, are in excess of $150 million/year3. Gas hydrates are likely to form in subsea flowlines unless the water is removed down to the lowest dew point encountered, highly effective insulation is in place, or inhibitors are used. The first option is difficult when supersaturated condensates exist in the flowline even after the gas phase is stripped to saturation levels. Stripping condensate completely of water is prohibitively expensive and effective insulation is beyond current economic limits. Therefore, the most effective solution appears to be the use of inhibitors. Generically, there are two kinds of hydrate inhibitors: thermodynamic inhibitors, and the more recently identified low-dosage inhibitors. Thermodynamic inhibitors have been in use for a long time, and continue to be the industry standard. This kind of inhibitor works as an antifreeze by involving the water in a thermodynamically favourable relationship, so that it is not available for reaction with the gas.

AB  - Summary. The occurrence of in-situ natural gas hydrates in the arctic North Slope of Alaska is governed by several thermodynamic and geologic parameters, such as mean annual surface temperature, geothermal gradients parameters, such as mean annual surface temperature, geothermal gradients above and below the base of the permafrost, pore-fluid salinity, permafrost base depth and temperature, subsurface pressure, and composition. Accurate knowledge of these parameters is necessary to determine the depths and thicknesses of zones of potential hydrate occurrences. The role of the parameters is discussed in this paper. To determine the hydrate-stability parameters is discussed in this paper. To determine the hydrate-stability zone, a nomogram has been developed and has been used for several Alaskan wells. For further delineation of gas hydrates, the neutron-transit-time crossplots have served as a valuable tool. To quantify gas hydrate deposits in terms of thickness, porosity, and saturation; use of neutron- and sonic-porosity-correction factors and Pickett crossplots is recommended. IntroductionNatural gas hydrates are ice-like mixtures of natural gas and water in which gas molecules are trapped within the crystalline structures of frozen water. They exist in arctic regions of Soviet Siberia, Canada, and the North Slope of Alaska where low temperatures exist far beneath the earth's surface. Gas hydrates are concentrated forms of natural gas and contain about 160 to 180 times the natural gas by volume at standard conditions. Because of the widespread existence of gas hydrates, they are considered as an alternative source of natural gas in the future. Natural gas hydrates have been studied in the past primarily to determine how to avoid their formation in natural gas transmission lines. The discovery of huge oil and natural gas resources on the North Slope of Alaska, however, first stimulated interest in gas hydrates in these regions. In 1971, a study by Katz indicated that gas hydrates can be stable up to depths of 3,940 ft [1200 m] on the North Slope of Alaska. The first confirmed evidence of the presence of gas hydrates in Alaska was obtained on March 15, 1972. presence of gas hydrates in Alaska was obtained on March 15, 1972. when Arco and Exxon recovered gas hydrate core samples in pressurized core barrels at several depths between 1,893 and 2,546 ft pressurized core barrels at several depths between 1,893 and 2,546 ft [577 and 776 m] from the Northwest Eileen Well No. 2 in the Prudhoe Bay field. Since then, several studies have been done to Prudhoe Bay field. Since then, several studies have been done to identify and quantify the gas hydrate resources of Alaska. In 1983, Collett and Collett and Ehlig-Economides examined 125 wells in the North Slope of Alaska for potential hydrate occurrence. They developed techniques for detecting gas hydrates from well log data. In their studies, 102 definite hydrate occurrences in 32 different wells were identified. Godbole and Ehlig-Economides examined 34 wells in Alaska and indicated that there is a possibility of hydrate occurrence in 14 of the wells. Kamath et al. examined 46 wells and showed that gas hydrate deposits may be found in 10 of them. Collett et al. have used the Pickett crossplotting technique along with corrected neutron porosity and sonic porosity values to determine the depths, thicknesses, porosities, and saturations of in-situ gas hydrates in the Kuparuk field region. They have estimated that the amount of natural gas trapped in gas hydrates in the Kuparuk field is about 53 x 10 ft /sq mile [579 X 10 M /kM ]. Matthews recently described logging characteristics of gas hydrates in the Northwest Eileen Well No. 2 and estimated that the amount of natural gas trapped within gas hydrates was about 17.5 x 10 to 37.7 x 10 ft /sq mile [192 x 10 to 412 x 10 , M / km]. Gas Hydrate Stability The simplest and quickest method of identifying the zone of possible gas hydrate occurrence is to examine the gas-hydratestability zone. The essential condition for gas hydrate stability at a given depth is that the actual earth temperature at the depth is lower than the equilibrium temperature of hydrates corresponding to the pressure and gas composition conditions. The thickness of a potential hydrate zone can be an important variable in drilling operations where drilling through hydrates requires special precautions. It also can be of significance in determining regions where hydrate occurrences might be sufficiently thick to justify gas recovery. The existence of a gas-hydrate stability condition, however, does not ensure that hydrates exist in that region, but only that they can exist. But if gas and water coexist within the hydrate-stability zone, then they must exist in gas hydrate form. The factors affecting the stability of gas hydrates in the arctic regions include mean annual surface temperatures, geothertnal gradients above and below the base of permafrost. salinity, permafrost depth, subsurface pressures, and gas composition. These parameters vary significantly in the North Slope region and hence the parameters vary significantly in the North Slope region and hence the accurate values of these parameters need to be known in determining the zone of hydrate stability. Table 1 gives the mean and standard deviations for mean annual surface temperature, Ts, permafrost base depth, Dp, geothermal gradient within permafrost. Gfr, and geothermal gradient below the base of the permafrost, Gth, in the Prudhoe Bay and Kuparuk-West Sak fields. The data for Prudhoe Bay and Kuparuk-West Sak fields. The data for individual wells in these fields are given in previous publications. Fig. 1 shows a nomogram for determination of the zone of methane hydrate stability for specific conditions of mean annual Ts, salinity, Gfr, and Gth. The use of this nomogram is quite simple. First, for given salinity (in ppm) and mean annual surface tem-perature(in degree F). TB - Ts is obtained by drawing a straight line Then for a given Gfr value, Dp is obtained by drawing a straight line through TB - Ts and Gfr, values. TB is the permafrost base temperature. For that value of Dp, the upper and lower boundaries othe methane-hydratestability zone are determined for the corresponding values of Gfr and Gth. Osterkamp and Payne and Zoeller have suggested that subsurface pressure for the shallow units on the North Slope can be assumed to be in a hydrostatic equilibrium (0.435 psi/ft [9.84 kPa/m]). A shallow subsurface drillstem test and repeat formation tests support the assumption of hydrostatic variation in pressure. The nomogram developed in this study assumes hydrostatic variation in pressure. The sensitivity analysis shows that the hydrate-stability zone increases by about 2.75% per percent increase pressure gradient above hydrostatic value. pressure gradient above hydrostatic value.

Summary A new method for predicting the formation of gas hydrates is described. The hydrate forming compounds may be pure gases or constitute a mixture like a natural gas or an oil. The influence of inhibitors like alcohols, glycols or salts for the hydrate formation is accounted for in a very flexible and robust program based on the method. Introduction Gas hydrates are solid inclusion compounds which may be formed where light hydrocarbons and/or some other light gases and water are contacted at temperatures below approx. 310 K. As the hydrates may exist far above the freezing point of water they can cause plugging of pipes, nozzles and separation equipment which would not be foreseen by considering the possibility of ice formation alone. The risk of hydrate formation may be reduced by reducing the water content of the hydrocarbon mixture. It is however necessary to reduce the water content significantly, so that the partial pressure of water in the mixture is below the very low equilibrium pressure above the gas hydrate. Another and much preferred alternative is therefore to lower the temperature for which hydrates may be formed by adding a so called inhibitor. Inhibition is quite analogous to freezing-point depression and the compounds causing the largest freezing point depressions for water are also the most powerful inhibitors. Alcohols, glycols and salts are examples of good inhibitors and methanol is the most commonly used.

AB  - Abstract The evaluation of gas hydrate resource potential continues to spread across the globe. Over the past decade, exploration emphasis has steadily shifted away from the confirmation of the presence of gas hydrate to the more complex issue of prospecting for specific accumulations of highly-concentrated gas. In general, concepts for gas hydrate exploration have evolved from a search for bottom-simulating reflectors to a process much more akin with conventional oil and gas exploration that features the direct detection of gas hydrate accumulations in seismic data supported by integrated geological/geophysical/geochemical studies that address issues of gas supply and reservoir distribution. This report aims to assimilate the lessons learned to date to outline a general exploration procedure for gas hydrate resources and outline remaining research challenges as follows: 1) delineation of the gas hydrate stability zone; 2) the identification and evaluation of strong amplitudes of the same polarity as the sea-floor ("peak" amplitudes) within that interval, as well as intervals of increased acoustic velocity; 3) mitigation of the geologic risk inherent in such prospects via seismic mapping of amplitude distribution along prospective horizons as well as broader seismic facies analyses; and 4) further risk mitigation through assessment of evidence of gas presence and gas migration into the gas hydrate stability zone.

AB  - Abstract Data acquired from major gas hydrate field programs over the past 20 years has led to much better understanding of the distribution of gas hydrate on the continental margins and how to detect them. Gas hydrate systems are extensions of the conventional hydrocarbon system but are much more closely related to biogenic gas systems. The temperatures at which most biogenic gas is generated is mostly below the base of gas hydrate stability which means that most biogenic gas has to migrate into the gas hydrate stability zone and has to be at levels in excess of solubility for gas hydrates to form. Gas hydrates had been considered ‘self-sealing’ but evidence from pressure cores and laboratory experiments indicate that gas hydrate deposits may need local seals. Detection of gas hydrates though seismic and other remote sensing methods has been demonstrated through drilling and coring programs. The GC955 site in the Gulf of Mexico is used as an example to demonstrate exploration concepts, through basin models, seismic detection, and drilling and coring results. Data from other locations are also discussed. A review of remote sensing data that could be used to delineate and quantify gas hydrate deposits is presented with an emphasis on low frequency exploration 3D seismic for imaging gas hydrate deposits at the base of gas hydrate stability.

AB  - Abstract The growing need of energy and the depletion of the conventional resources i.e. the fossil fuels have led us to think seriously about the non conventional resources like solar, tidal, wind, waste energy, etc. Apart from these resources the science and technology is rather focusing more on gas hydrates. Natural Gas which is an important source of energy is being consumed about 85 trillion cubic feet per year. The current natural gas reserves show that they will last only for 60 years at this rate of consumption. But luckily the reserves of gas hydrates (natural gas) are enough so as to provide 100 percent of the present energy and will serve up to 2000 years, but we aren't able to extract them economically. The idea of 'EXTRACTION OF METHANE FROM GAS HYDRATES USING ANAEROBIC ARCHAE-BACTERIA' may not only help in extracting methane from gas hydrates but also may convert water and carbon di oxide present in gas hydrates into methane. In this idea, I propose the use of anaerobic archaebacteria namely methanogenic archaebacteria, to convert carbon di oxide and water to methane. The above process is exothermic in nature that liberates heat, which can increase the temperature of water above its boiling point and cause gas hydrates to liberate methane. The characteristics of the anaerobic archaebacteria satisfy the conditions of existence of gas hydrates. Thus, these bacteria may help in extracting methane from gas hydrates effectively and efficiently. INTRODUCTION Need of Unconventional Resources The people of the world use natural gas (methane, CH4), one of the fossil fuels, to provide 25% of the everyday energy they use. At present, this amounts to burning about 2.4 trillion cubic meters (85 trillion cubic feet) of natural gas each year. Unfortunately, we have found enough natural gas reserves in the world to last only another 60 years at this rate of consumption. This means that our grandchildren might see the end of natural gas. In turn these fossil fuels cause pollution on combustion, producing dangerous carbon mono oxide causing global warming. The solution to this dangerous problem is the use of unconventional resources, which will take care of our grand children. Solar, Tidal, Wind Waste energy are the forms of unconventional resources, the methods to use them effectively fail in some cases, say as in automobiles, in operation of huge machines in big industries. So this leads to the search of such an unconventional resource that is not only efficient but also available in abundance. This led to the discovery of Gas Hydrates.

AB  - ABSTRACT:In this paper we discuss on fundamental properties of formation and dissociation of gas hydrates to reveal the dynamic behavior in the process of replacement and reformation of CO hydrate. Raman spectroscopy was used to observe directly the behavior on CO hydrate formation under in-situ condition. Based on the results, the rate of formation of gas hydrates was quantitatively analyzed using the original conceptual model of formation kinetics.INTRODUCTIONLarge amounts of gas hydrates are found in marine sediments and permafrost. To extract methane gas from its reservoir in a practical production way, it is necessary to obtain fundamental information on the mechanism underlying the formation and dissociation of gas hydrates and their properties, including kinetics and crystal growth. We have proposed an advanced method of gas hydrate production, by which methane gas is extracted from the reservoir by replacing methane with CO2 at the molecular level. Fig.1 illustrates the concept of CO utilization in mining gas hydrates. This method would be feasible to achieve the sequestration of CO into the sediments. The main purposes of this research are to elucidate the mechanism underlying hydrate reformation and replacement and accumulate practical data for completing the original concept of the proposed method. 22Gas hydrates are paid much attention as a new energy resources [1] and storage medium for COas global warming gas [2,3]. To accomplish utilization technique of this gas hydrate, it is important to understand the formation kinetics of hydrate precisely. The hydrate growth kinetics have been studied mainly at the temperature range below -10 deg.C, or above 0 deg.C. However, there are only a few detailed kinetic studies of COhydrate near the melting point of ice (-10 to 0 deg C.). Interestingly, it was reported that the growth rate of COhydrate increases remarkably in this temperature region [4].

AB  - ABSTRACTFrequently there is a necessity for prevention of gas hydrate solid phase appearance in gas treatment systems, for instance, at gas-condensate preparation plants of Russian northern gas-condensate fields. The injection of methanol or glycols is commonly used for such purpose. In this work, technological schemes of gas treatment where injected methanol is used for hydrate control are considered. A simple, but reliable method for thermodynamic calculations of the hydrate inhibition process during gas treatment is presented. In this connection, a simplified approach for calculation of VLH phase equilibria in gas-condensate stream is discussed. Some new experimental data for VLH equilibria are presented where V - is three component gas phase (mixture of CH4+C2H6+C3He, which models the composition of natural gas in gas-condensate fields); L - liquid water phase (the solution "water plas methanol" in which CH30H has more than 00 wt%); H - hydrate phase. Computer programs are developed for calculating the optimal inhibitor amount for a gas and gas-condensate preparation plant upstream from a transport pipeline. INTRODUCTIONWestern Siberia IS the important raw material, base of the gas production industry of Russia. It should be noted that such giant gas condensate field as Urengoi and Yam5urg now provide the main production of gas and stable gas-condensate. The standard technological scheme for preparing raw natural gas and gas-condensate before pipe-line transport is shown in fig.1. Ordinarily It includes three gas-liquid sepators (S-1,S-2,S-3), two gas-gas type heat-exhangers (H-l and H-2), throttle (or turbo-expander, ejector) and some additional equipment Which is not essential in the framework of our discussion. A high-concentrated solution of methanol (85-95wt.%) IS injected into the gas-condensate stream before heat-exchangers H-1 and H-2. Then, the methanol water solution (saturated methanol) is removed from the separators and sent to the still for methanol recovery.

AB  - Summary Gas-hydrate plugging poses an operational challenge to offshore petroleum production and transportation. In this study, a computational-fluid-dynamics (CFD) model that uses ANSYS Fluent (ANSYS 2019) multiphase-flow-modeling techniques to simulate and analyze the effect of gas-hydrate flow in pipelines is proposed. For this purpose, the study attempted to integrate the ANSYS Fluent model with an existing commercial subsea-pipeline-visualization tool. To validate the simulation results, two case studies were conducted. The first study was about a pipeline whose dimensions are based on the specifications in existing literature (Balakin et al. 2010a). The second study was about a pipeline with more-complex geometry (M-shaped jumper with six elbows). The Eulerian/Eulerian method was used to model the multiphase hydrate flow. The population-balance method (PBM) was then used to model hydrate agglomeration and its breakup mechanism in the flow. A parametric study of the stresses in the pipelines resulting from flow-induced vibration (FIV) was conducted to identify the regions that underwent the maximum stresses and deformations under various flow conditions. The tool can be used in the petroleum industry to identify the operational hazards in offshore structures and to take necessary safety measures to avoid any potential catastrophic events.

AB  - IntroductionThe presence of hydrates has primarily been a nuisance or a well control issue when drilling for conventional oil and gas offshore and in onshore permafrost regions. However, methane hydrates could very well become the new source of clean and affordable gas supplies in the United States by 2030. For example, if several large "sweet spots" of hydrates could be defined and developed in U.S. waters, the ultimate recoverable hydrate resource could range from 1,500 to 2,000 Tcf of gas. This is close to the current U.S. domestic natural gas recoverable resource, yet it may be less than 1% of the total in-place methane hydrate resources of the U.S.To achieve the long term goals of the Federal Government in regard to energy supplies for the U.S.A., the Department of Energy is committed to developing the knowledge and technology base to allow commercial production of methane from domestic hydrate deposits by the year 2015.Hydrates or clathrates are a crystalline lattice material consisting of molecules of water that have formed an open, cage-like solid lattice that encloses molecules of methane. Hydrates of a given composition exist under particular pressure-temperature conditions caused by geological conditions. The variability of the pressure-temperature phase diagrams for hydrates is caused by changes in geological conditions during hydrate evolution and by the chemical composition of the hydrate, which may have been enriched with ethane. Under changing geological conditions hydrates can dissociate and be released gradually or explosively, depending on how rapidly the pressure drops or the temperature increases. In addition to hydrates being only quasi-stable, the crystal structure of a hydrate packs methane so efficiently, depending on the purity of the hydrate, it can contain between 70 to 164 times the volume of free gas at standard temperature and pressure vs. the volume of the hydrate prior to dissociation.Methane hydrates contain enormous volumes of natural gas and are now known to accumulate worldwide on the slopes of continental shelves and below the artic permafrost where pressures and temperatures are suitable and methane and water are available. The existence and thickness of hydrates zones are determined by the influx of gas and water through shallow sediment, the rapid accumulation of organic rich sediments, the geothermal gradient, the water depth and sea-bottom temperature, and the gas mixture of the hydrate. Analysis indicates hydrates can occupy as much as 500 m of sediments.Because hydrates will dissociate or release free gas upon a decrease of pressure, increase of temperature, or combinations thereof; premature dissociation around the wellbore must be avoided during the drilling process to minimize wellbore instability and well control issues resulting from changes in the mechanical and physical properties of the sediments when hydrates dissociate. In addition, the hydrates dissociation into gas and fresh water will create a gas cut mud with a lower mud density causing associated changes in mud rheology that reduce hole cleaning capacity, which may cause wellbore instability and potential hole collapse or a pack off and stuck pipe.There is an enormous amount of information available in the public domain as to the characterization, composition, and the location of known deposits of methane hydrates. However, the know-how to drill, complete, and produce hydrates in commercial quantities is just beginning to be developed and has received little attention from the oil and gas industry.Although the focus of this paper is upon drilling for methane hydrates in marine environments, specifically in deep water, the issues are applicable to drilling hydrates on land as well.Methane hydrates drilling-related challenges include:Narrow margins between pore pressure and fracture gradient in ocean surface sediments and within the hydrate reservoir.Surface hole instability.Subsidence caused by hydrate production.

AB  - Deepwater gas field development and/or gas fields’ production in remote locations requires long tiebacks with low temperature and high pressure flow paths and complex seabed topographies. Hydrate formation and plugging is one of the most probable Flow Assurance risks under those conditions, and there is an urgent need for a better knowledge of these gas dominant systems behaviour regarding hydrate plug formation as well as effects of additives (Thermodynamic, Kinetic Hydrate Inhibition (KHI) and Anti-Agglomerant (AA)). Indeed, during the design phase of new field development, oil companies have to choose a hydrate mitigation strategy. To do that, important questions rapidly arise: What about the gas layer protection? How can non-volatile additives act/protect the non-wetted top of the line from condensed water hydrate formation in stratified flow? Is there a need to take/run some specific procedures (such as slug of additives) to avoid hydrate problems? The Additive and Hydrate at the Top of Line (AHToL) JIP phase 1 project's objective was to acquire knowledge and data in multiphase Lyre pilot loop in such gas dominant conditions. The paper presents Lyre loop pilot tests performed with gas dominant systems without additive. The hydrate formation was performed in multiphase flow. The pilot and tests results in stratified flow are shown. Two types of fluids compositions were tested: Gas/Water and Gas/Condensate/Water. The water to hydrate conversion rates are calculated. Photos of hydrate deposits inside the flow loop are shown. The plugging mechanisms identified show a direct correlation with the fluids compositions circulating

AB  - Abstract The simulations and numerical analyses of triaxial compression tests on soil samples recovered from the East Nankai trough have been performed by the elasto-viscoplastic constitutive equation. And the numerical analyses of the laboratory model tests on ground deformation in methane hydrate production were carried out by finite element method. From the comparison with the experimental results it is proved that the simulations can express well the behavior of experiments and the numerical analysis results can well reproduce the deformation behavior of ground in the model tests. Introduction Methane hydrate is currently being eagerly examined as a next-generation energy resource in Japan to replace oil and natural gas. The Research Consortium for Methane Hydrate Resources in Japan was established to undertake research in accordance with Japan's Methane Hydrate Exploitation Program prepared by the Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry. To produce methane gas from methane hydrate safely and without damaging the environment, it is necessary to address many wideranging environmental issues. One of them is to assess seabed deformation during methane gas production. In the above Consortium we are investigating the deformation of seabed ground which may occur due to the production of methane gas from methane hydrate. Geotechnical properties of seabed ground have a significant effect on the deformation behavior. Soil samples were recovered from the East Nankai trough which is expected as one of the fields of natural resources of methane hydrate. We performed the soil index tests, consolidation tests and triaxial compression tests on these soil samples and estimated the geotechnical properties of soil samples based on the results of these laboratory tests. Then we identified the material parameters for the elasto-viscoplastic constitutive equation which can express the mechanical properties of the seabed ground and we performed simulations of triaxial compression tests on soil samples by this constitutive equation. Further we developed a simulator for the estimation of seabed ground deformation using the above constitutive equation. We carried out the laboratory model tests on ground deformation in methane hydrate production and we performed the numerical analyses of these model tests by this simulator. Outline of Triaxial Compression Tests The digging of wells was carried out in deep sea at the East Nankai Trough. We performed triaxial compression tests on core samples recovered from the Nankai Trough Well (Nishio et al., 2006). The triaxial compression tests were carried out in K0 consolidation undrained condition. The depth of core samples used in tests is 8.5-225.0m below the seabed surface. The samples used in the tests are mainly cohesive soil.

AB  - Abstract Gas hydrate inhibition is a serious concern for operators who produce or transport natural gas at pressure and temperature conditions favorable for hydrates formation. As production goes into deeper water, hydrate control grows in importance. Ideally, operators want total hydrate control without the problems associated with Thermodynamic Hydrate Inhibitors (THI), mainly methanol and/or Low Dose Hydrate Inhibitors (LDHI). Past laboratory studies and field experience indicated that hydrate inhibition synergy is gained through the combination of Thermodynamic Inhibitors and Kinetic Inhibitors (KHI). This is termed a Hybrid Hydrate Inhibitor (HHI). Because of the performance, logistical and cost drivers presented by the use of methanol, any alternative approach would have to consider these three factors. Detailed studies were performed on several mixtures of polymeric and non-polymeric KHI, and THI to find best performing combinations of hydrate inhibitors. The objective of the study was to provide all of the benefits of the existing technology with improved performance, improved logistics and at a cost not to exceed hydrate prevention with methanol. It was uncovered that some KHIs combined together supplement each other to offer synergistic performance for significantly lower cost than single KHI products. The work to be presented resulted in discovery of few KHI/KHI/THI combinations that outperformed any previously used product. Oil and gas industry is continuously looking for more cost-efficient and safer technologies. This work offers another improvement in flow control assurance. Introduction Laboratory studies and past field experience indicated that hydrate inhibition synergy is gained through the combination of Thermodynamic Inhibitors (THI) and Kinetic Inhibitors (KHI) [1]. This is termed a Hybrid Hydrate Inhibitor (HHI). Because of the performance, logistical and cost drivers presented by the use of methanol, any alternative approach would have to consider those three factors. The performance has to do with hydrate dissolution in the event a hydrate formed during operations. A Kinetic Inhibitor (KHI) can prevent hydrates formation but cannot dissolve already formed hydrates. Anti-agglomerant inhibitors (AA) allow hydrates to form but keep the hydrate particles dispersed in the fluids. The logistical has to do with pump sizing; i.e. conventional Low Dosage Inhibitor (LDHI) applications require new pumps and configurations. Potential synergy in gas hydrate inhibition between polyether amines (PEA) and polymeric type kinetic hydrate inhibitors (PHI) has been reported before [2, 3]; however, this phenomenon was not studied thoroughly. PHIs are very costly chemicals, about five times more expensive than PEAs. The cost of methanol is far less than specialty LDHI chemistry.

AB  - A concern in CO2 storage in sub-seabed aquifer is CO2leakage, which may cause impacts on marine organism. To overcome this, storage of CO2 in the form of hydrate in sub-seabed sediments is proposed. By this method, the potential of storage amount is expected to be enlarged as well as the influence on the ecosystem can be reduced. To estimate the capacity and efficiency of this CO2storage option, the formation rate of the hydrate is necessary. Formation of gas hydrate at the interface between gas and water phases consists of two-stages: gas diffusion through hydrate film and hydrate formation at the interface between the film and water. This study aims at modelling of CO2 hydrate formation considering CO2diffusion in hydrate film and at obtaining model constants, such as formation rate and diffusion coefficient. By curve-fitting of calculated and measured heat fluxes, the rate and coefficient were obtained. INTRODUCTIONOne of the concerns in CO2 storage in subsea underground aquifer is a risk of CO2 leakage through direct faults or boreholes and it may cause impacts on marine organism near the leakage sites. Inui and Sato (2006) proposed storage of CO2 in the form of hydrate in subsea underground. The influence on the ecosystem can be greatly reduced because CO2 is made a solid and is stored for a long term. Moreover, the potential of storage amount is about twice as large as the aquifer storage, 18 to 180 billion t-CO2. Ohgaki et al. (1996) also proposed a method to generate heat when CO2 hydrate is formed and to supply the heat to promote the dissociation of CH4 hydrate. Komai et al. (1999) paid attention to the generation of CO2 hydrate at higher temperature and a lower pressure than those for CH4 hydrate, and suggested the production of CH4 by replacement of CO2 hydrate.

AB  - Abstract Over the past decade, gas hydrates have stimulated significant interest and triggered fundamental research. Primarily, the focus has been on hydrate blockage in pipelines, and on naturally occurring gas hydrates. However, gas hydrates can be useful in many different ways that can be pertinent to our industry, thanks to their unique structural packing where only certain molecules can enter the gas hydrate cavities. Among the several potential uses of gas hydrate technology are gas separation, transportation and storage of natural gas, desalination, and carbon dioxide disposal. In particular, it is possible to (i) separate the heavier components (pentane and higher) from natural gas, and (ii) capture, store and transport natural gas. This paper proposes a workflow for capturing, storing and transporting gas in the hydrate form, particularly for situations where there are infrastructural constraints such as lack of pipelines. These applications of gas hydrate technology can have potential benefits to the oil and gas industry. Introduction The need for new methods for gas transportation is the challenge that drives the development of hydrate technology for storing and transporting natural gas (Masoudi, et al, 2005). The ability of natural gas to form hydrate in combination with water is a very interesting and useful concept (Makagon, 1997) and can be widely utilized in the industry. An important feature of hydrates is their high storage capacity. 180 volume units of gas at standard conditions can potentially be packed into 1 volume unit gas hydrate crystals. Gas hydrates can be regarded as a safe and easy way of capturing gas, storing and transporting associated, stranded and flared gas (Berner et al, 2003). The objective of this work is to propose useful industrial applications that rely on gas hydrate technology, based on selected gas samples (Table1). These applications include situations when: (1) Gas storage is required, and so natural gas is converted to gas hydrate and stored for future use. (2) Natural gas hydrate technology provides an attractive method to capture and transport natural gas on a small scale. (3) In the hydrate process of capturing natural gas, heavy components (C5 and above) are separated out as Natural Gas Liquids (NGL), while C1 to C4 are stored in hydrate form. The proposed workflow will be discussed using two representative gas samples (‘Dry gas' and ‘Sample 2'). The former is basically pure methane, whereas sample 2 has the heavier C5 and C6 components. It is assumed that these gases are produced from a given field, at a given rate. In this study, the PVTSim program (Calsep, 2008) was used for the evaluation of hydrate formation and expansion processes. Expansion of the gas from wellhead conditions is necessary to trigger hydrate formation, depending on the properties of the gas, as it will be shown in this analysis with the two selected samples.

AB  - AbstractThe storage of natural gas in hydrates has been investigated since it was discovered that they store large quantities of gas. Dtflerent storage methods have been suggested: either keeping hydrate under low temperature or under pressure. This work presents the results of experiments aimed at improving the quality of the produced hydrate in term of gas content per unit volume of water. We have tested and developed a new water-soluble chemical that promotes methane hydrate formation by reducing the interfacial tension properties of the water. A series of investigations identijied that, depending on the concentration, the effect of hydrate inhibiting agents such as sodium chloride, alcohols and Carbonyl Compounds on gas hydrate formation, can either promote or suppress formation of gas hydrates in systems of water and natural gas. It was also proven that growth rates of a crystal face depend on how fast the heat is removed from the surface and this depends on the rate of heat transfer at the interface. The quality and quantity of hydrates were examined for their gas contents in a low temperature PVT apparatus. The total water conversion to hydrate in case of sH and sII hydrates was improved using hydrate promoters discovered during this work The rate of gas content per volume of hydrate was significantly improved from to 196 sm3/sm3 compared with 150-180 sm3/sm3 for pure water hydrate. IntroductionThe manufacture of natural gas hydrates (NGH), a stable solid comprising natural gas and water, is proposed as an alternative storage and transportation technology for natural gas instead of LNG and pipeline transportation. It is also valid to view this technology as a potential competitor to other energy forms such as LPG, fuel oil and coal. The manufacture of NGH requires only moderate cooling (typically -15 °C) and provides a stable solid when stored in an insulated environment. NHG's are readily decomposed into their hydrocarbon constituents and water at the point of delivery. Commercialisation of this technology in Western Australia could be undertaken via two principal routes. The first is to directly compete in the small to medium-scale domestic energy market. This market is currently serviced by road and rail transported LPG, fuel oil and increasingly LNG. This market may provide a low cost opportunity to test and commercialise the various NGH technologies. The economics screening study for a road based domestic energy market indicates that the cost of energy from NGH may compete with LPG and diesel delivering energy for a base case scenario at approximately A$6/GJ. The second route would be via large scale NGH production, competing directly in the global LNG market. This will be reviewed at a later date; some studies supporting this commercialisation route have already been carried out in Scandinavia but are not reviewed in this paper. Experimental ProceduresThe experimental apparatus consists of two equilibrium cells, the main cell is a synthetic sapphire providing 3dimensional visibility, and it has a total volume of 700 ml and is designed to handle pressures up 1500 bar.

AB  - ABSTRACTThis paper describes experiments on hydrate decomposition. Destabilizing reagents, such as methanol solutions or warm liquids, were injected into a pressurized cell containing synthesized methane hydrate or hydrate composites. A unique facility was employed to better simulate conditions that would prevail during in situ destabilization in hydrate-rich, deep ocean sediments. A one-dimensional model was developed to interpret the experimental results. The primary goal was to further elucidate methane hydrate dissociation kinetics under conditions relevant to practical gas extraction scenarios.INTRODUCTIONGas hydrates are crystalline compounds which occur when water forms a cage-like structure around gas molecules such as methane. Hydrates are found both in permafrost and in deep ocean marine sediments under favorable thermodynamic conditions of low temperatures and high pressures. There is growing interest in gas hydrates because of their potential as a future energy resource and the possible threat they pose to seafloor stability and global climate (for a comprehensive review of the subject see, for example, Max, 2000). Because of their greater accessibility, shallow permafrost hydrate resources located in the Arctic have been the most actively targeted for resource assessment and pilot scale research and development projects (Sharma et al. 1992).Several methods to extract gas from hydrates for energy have been proposed: depressurization, thermal stimulation, and inhibitor injection. These schemes are all based on the in-situ dissociation of hydrates into gas and water. In order to develop such methods safely and economically, it is necessary to understand the underlying physical phenomena as well as possible. Of particular importance are the kinetics of methane hydrate decomposition, since any practical exploitation of hydrate resources would depend on the basic time scales of the process. For given thermodynamic conditions, there exists a fundamental intrinsic rate of hydrate decomposition, a speed limit of sorts imposed by molecular constraints.

AB  - Abstract Deadlegs are defined as pipe sections in intermittent use for production or special services in oil/gas production systems. Deadlegs often pose hydrate control challenges to gas and oil production systems as the fluid inside is close to stagnant and therefore can be rapidly cooled by the environment without proper insulation or heat tracing. Water vapor can condense in the deadleg, resulting in a potential hydrate risk. Over time the deadleg may be blocked completely by hydrates. The hydrate challenges, if not properly managed, can cause severe consequences in terms of safety and cost for oil/gas productions. A systematic study has been performed to better understand the process and mechanism of hydrate deposition in deadlegs. To study hydrate deposition in deadlegs experimentally, laboratory scale deadleg systems were designed and built to consider pipe sizes of 1-, 2-, 3-, and 4-in. inner diameter and approximately 50 in. long. The pipes were gas-filled and saturated with water from a reservoir at the bottom of the pipe. The experimental work focused on measuring hydrate deposition, and in some cases, plugging, for different water reservoir temperatures (30 to 80 °C), pipe wall temperatures (-10 to 15 °C), and duration (1 to 84 days). The results from measurements provided insights into the dynamic process of hydrate deposition, such as the mechanism for hydrate deposition, plugging, and distribution along the pipe.

AB  - ABSTRACTMethane hydrate has been formed synthetically in two types of hostspecimens, ice-sand and/or water- sand mixture, which were confined in a tri-axial pressure vessel under the deep-sea condition equivalent to approximately 800m deep. The shear strength of synthetic sediments increased due to methane hydrate formation. However, synthetic sediment from ice-sand mixture showed no significant increase in the strength at less than 25% of the saturation degree of methane hydrate, whereas the sediment strength by water-sand mixture rose successively with the methane hydrate saturation. Moreover, the effects of saturation degree of methane hydrate on cohesion and elastic properties were confirmed.INTRODUCTIONResearch Consortium for Methane Hydrate Resources in Japan conducted exploration drillings in Nankai Trough off the coast of Japan recently. Methane hydrate has been confirmed in core samples recovered from marine sediments. However, the exploitation of methane hydrate needs more technological developments due to distinctive characteristics of methane hydrate. Because of so-called self-preservation effect, promising methods for dissociation of methane hydrate are thought to be “depressurization”, “thermal injection” and “usage of inhibitors” in production wells. AIST(National Institute of Advanced Industrial Science and Technology) joined the consortium and has been undertaking research projects to develop technologies for exploitation of methane hydrate in the near future. Development of simulation code for methane hydrate production is one of the main purposes of the projects and our research group in particular is currently engaged in consolidation modeling of methane hydrate bearing sediments. Dissociation of methane hydrate in marine sediments may cause seabed subsidence and/or deformation of methane hydrate sediment strata. Such incidence will directly affect productivity of production wells if it is not properly estimated prior to the exploitation. Deformation behavior and change in shear strength of the sediments are not clearly understood on the occasion of methane hydrate production.

AB  - ABSTRACT The amount of gas sequestered in gas hydrates is probably enormous, but estimates are highly speculative due to the lack of previous quantitative studies. Gas volumes that may be attributed to a gas hydrate accumulation within a given geologic setting are dependent on a number of reservoir parameters; one of which, gas-hydrate saturation, can be assessed with data obtained from downhole well logging devices. The primary objective of this study was to develop quantitative well-log evaluation techniques which will permit the calculation of gas-hydrate saturations in gas-hydrate-bearing sedimentary units.The "standard" and "quick look" Archie relations (resistivity log data) yielded accurate gas-hydrate and free-gas saturations within all of the gas hydrate accumulations assessed in the field verification phase of the study. Compressional wave acoustic log data have been used along with the Timur, modified Wood, and the Lee weighted average acoustic equations to calculate accurate gas-hydrate saturations in all of the gas hydrate accumulations assessed in this study. The well log derived gas-hydrate saturations calculated in the field verification phase of this study, which range from as low as 2% to as high as 97%, confirm that gas hydrates represent a potentially important source of natural gas.

AB  - ABSTRACT In this particular paper we propose a new, and simple technique to predict one of the most important physical properties of hydrates namely the heat of hydrate dissociation (∆Hd ) at temperatures above 273.15K. It is shown that it is possible to determine ∆Hd by knowledge of the size of the guest gas molecules. To a first approximation, the enthalpy of dissociation is independent of the type and the concentration of the guest gas, with the size constraint. Also as a notable outcome most natural gases containing appreciable amounts of methane and propane should have essentially the same heat of dissociation. INTRODUCTION In natural gas production and processing, hydrates are normally considered to be nuisances because free water combines with natural gas molecules to form crystals which plug flow channels and impede flow. One recent literature citation (Boniface, 1990) of this particular phenomenon is hypothesized to have caused the Piper Alpha platform disaster in the North Sea. Great efforts have been devoted to prevent hydrates from forming and from dissociating once they are formed. Dissociation is normally affected by depressurizing the transfer line, before cleaning the line with a device called a "pig". Models for hydrate dissociation have been proposed by the laboratories of Bishnoi (Kim et al., 1987; Jamaluddin et al., 1989), (Holder et al., 1982, 1986), (Kamath and Godbole, 1987) and this laboratory (Ullerich et al., 1987; Selim and Sloan, 1985, 1989). In all of the reported dissociation models, the most important physical parameter is (lHd ) , the heat of dissociation, defined as the heat required to turn the hydrates into flowing phases of gas and liquid water. The purpose of this work is to provide means of quick estimate of the heat of dissociation, if the gas composition is known.

AB  - ABSTRACTEnergy supply is an essential element of modern life and fossil fuels are expected to remain the dominant resource throughout the twenty first century and beyond. Natural gas, the most environmentally benign of fossil fuels, is on the upswing, boosted by recent successes in the exploitation of shale deposits. Natural gas hydrate accumulations which have been found worldwide on the slopes of continental shelves and arctic permafrost may further the use of natural gas by centuries. We propose a commercial exploitation scheme that involves hydraulically fractured horizontal wells with multiple treatments. A suite of wells would provide mechanisms of injection and/or production. INTRODUCTIONThe quest for energy resources is an ongoing process and while over the last two decades there has been a significant move towards alternatives to the traditional fossil fuels, natural gas is poised to become the premier fuel of the world economy both for its obvious environmental benefits but also because of its abundance. Shale gas was an energy source that was known but considered until recently inaccessible. As a result of the deployment of existing but newly tailored technology (e.g., horizontal wells with multiple transverse hydraulic fractures) shale has provided a large volume of new gas and, especially, almost unilaterally has doubled the world expected ultimate recovery. The success of shale gas has triggered by analogy a renewed interest in natural gas hydrates whose volume dwarfs any other energy source on earth. If techniques for their commercial recovery materialize and are economically proven, natural gas hydrate deposits have the potential to provide a huge amount of natural gas for human use. Considerable research has already been carried out for the characterization, composition and location of known deposits of natural gas hydrates.

AB  - Abstract As the world increases its natural gas development and exploitation projects, Gas hydrate will constitute a major flow assurance concern in most gas facilities. It is imperative to critically examine the various means of hydrate formation and effective ways of managing gas hydrates. This work considers gas hydrate formation due to gas expansion. It was discovered that hydrate formation may occur at the Joule Thompson's valve due to cooling during gas expansion. Hydrate prevention was effected by determining the critical point at which the expanded gas moves from the hydrate free zone to the hydrate risk zone. A comparative study was carried out to evaluate the effectiveness of methanol (MeOH) and monoethylene glycol (MEG) in hydrate inhibition during gas expansion. Hydrate formation curve and inhibitor performance curves were generated using CSMGem Software. MeOH performed better than MEG as 10wt% MeOH could prevent hydrate formation when the gas was expanded to about 3338 psia whereas, 10wt% of MEG could not prevent hydrate formation when gas was expanded beyond 3750 psia. This work will aid the engineer to assess problem areas upfront and to determine mitigating measures.

AB  - AbstractMethane hydrates are now recognized to be present in substantial quantities along most ocean margins. Current estimates indicate that methane in hydrates exceeds fixed carbon in petroleum reserves by about a factor of three. This is a large potential source of energy, capable of lasting for centuries. In response, Japan, Korea, Norway, India and Canada are actively investigating the acquisition of methane from hydrates as an energy source. Their success could significantly restructure the global economy. While a large international focus is on methane hydrates as a source of energy, hydrates are also thought to influence ocean carbon cycling, global warming, and coastal sediment stability. Thus, methane hydrates are a significant emerging research issue. While the global distribution and quality of hydrate fields are certainly being pursued, this presentation describes more fundamental investigations of naturally formed methane hydrates. Specifically, the Naval Research Laboratory (NRL) has initiated research on the influence of hydrates on ocean floor geoacoustical and geotechnical properties. In addition, NRL and Argonne National Laboratory (ANL) have studied methane hydrates from different regions of the world ocean for variations in structure and composition. This presentation compares the methane hydrate structure, composition, and source of carbon for samples taken from the Norwegian-Greenland Sea and the Gulf of Mexico. Structural analysis is compared using x-ray diffraction. Composition is described from gas chromatography, and the carbon source is identified with carbon isotope analysis.IntroductionMethane hydrates vastly exceeds other carbon reservoirs in the ocean1. Research demonstrates that both thermogenic and biological carbon sources contribute to the formation of the methane hydrates2,3. There is a large variation in the sources of methane between ecosystems. The carbon cycling that controls methane production in the ocean floor is related to a complex mixture of biological, chemical and physical processes. Physical factors on the ocean floor relate to motion of the continental plates resulting in expulsion of fluids and volatile compounds, flows of geothermal energy toward the sediment-ocean interface, cold pressure mediated seeps of reduced compounds, and high levels of land based carbon transport to the ocean floor. These processes result in a variety of chemical speciation through key elemental pools that enhance microbial activity. For example, ocean floor thermal seeps have a high flux of reduced compounds, e.g. CH4, H2S and NH4, that supports the chemoautotrophic population. These cycles serve as the base of the food chain where enzymatic oxidation results in fixation of CO2 into cellular biomass. In active regions this results in CO2 serving as the terminal electron acceptor and methane production and fixation in hydrates. The variation in thermogenic and biological methane sources influences the hydrate content and structure. The degree that these factors contribute to the hydrate stability and formation warrants further research. Results from this research topic will contribute to methane hydrate mining strategies, understanding of coastal stability and environmental health, analysis of ocean carbon cycling, and predication of global warming.

AB  - ABSTRACTIn this paper, we present experimental arguments for the guest replacement of methane hydrate with carbon dioxide using in situ Raman spectroscopy at high pressures. The surface shielding of carbon dioxide hydrate formed in the outer layer plays a key function of retarded dissociation of methane hydrate in the core. The water phase produced during the replacement reaction allows the reaction to proceed rapidly by enhancing diffusion of both methane and carbon dioxide, resulting in complete and relatively fast recovery of methane gas from methane hydrate. These results may strongly encourage further efforts in the study of guest stability of clathrate hydrate and may provide useful applications for future technologies.INTRODUCTIONAn important practical feature of gas hydrate is that vast quantities of methane in the form of the gas hydrate exist in the permafrost zone and the subsea sediment (Kvenvolden, 1999). To develop the method for commercially producing natural gases from methane hydrate layers, the environmental and safety issues, which are of particular importance, should be first clarified. In the case of carbon dioxide hydrate, the disposal of global warming gases, mainly carbon dioxide, on the ocean floor using the hydrate formation process has been carefully studied (Saito et al., 2000). Several field experiments were conducted to test and prove ideas for carbon dioxide ocean disposal by in-situ hydrate formation (Brewer et al., 1999).It is now possible to closely monitor the exchange process of guest molecules of gas hydrate with other hydrate-formers. Neutron diffraction experiments have enabled recent success in studying guest replacement, especially accompanying structural transition, and provide information for equilibrium exchange between guest molecules in the hydrate and free molecules in the surrounding phase (Halpern et al., 2001).

AB  - AbstractHydrate management in deepwater production jumpers connecting production Christmas Trees to a manifold, or directly to a production line, generally requires the injection of large quantities of methanol to flush the line during the preservation sequence that follows a production shut down. The paper describes how thermal insulation, methanol lines and umbilicals are sized to prevent hydrates forming in jumpers. It then goes on to show how a low energy, electrical heating system can improve current operational practices by reducing the requirements for methanol injection and how this simple and efficient device can also be used to dissociate a hydrate plug and eliminate the need for an additional remediation system.A series of reduced scale tests have been performed at the French Petroleum Institute (IFP) in a 2" insulated pressure cell where several hydrate plugs were dissociated using the electrical heating system. The main results of these tests are presented to establish the thermal and electrical efficiency and to show that a typical production jumper can be preserved with little electrical power.The paper also provides details and results of a full scale test performed underwater on a prototype section of insulated jumper fitted with the heating and temperature control systems. These tests have qualified this technology for future projects.These experiments and tests have allowed the efficiency and limitations of the electrical heating system to be determined so that it can be used by Operators seeking environmentally friendly solutions for future deepwater developments that will reduce topsides requirements and simplify the operational hydrate prevention strategy.IntroductionHydrates are crystals in which cages of water molecules are stabilized by host gas molecules such as methane, ethane, propane or carbon dioxide. Hydrates that look like ice can form in production lines and plug them. For hydrates to form, four conditions are necessary: gas, water, low temperatures and high pressures [1]. These conditions are encountered in deepwater developments with subsea Christmas trees where warm production fluids containing gas and water at pressures of more than 100 bars encounter low seabed temperatures of about 4°C around the trees, jumpers and flowlines.To avoid hydrates, the first line of defence is to provide adequate insulation on all parts the subsea system including the Christmas trees, well jumpers, manifolds and the flowline loops that carry the production fluids back to the topsides on the surface facility. Passive insulation is generally designed to keep the production fluids above the hydrate formation temperature in the flowing condition and for a certain additional period in case of a production shut-down, often referred to as the cool-down time. During an extended production shut-down dead oil can be circulated around the flowline loops to prevent hydrate formation but this does not apply to the production jumpers where gas pockets form in the high spots and water collects at the low points.

AB  - SummaryTwo deepwater wells in widely separated geographical areas have experienced natural gas hydrate formation during drilling operations. In both cases, hydrates, ice-like mixtures of natural gas and water, plugged subsea equipment, causing difficulties in subsequent operations. The potential for hydrate formation merits consideration during planning and conducting of deepwater drilling operations.IntroductionDuring recent years, the petroleum industry has continued to extend and to expand deepwater exploration drilling efforts in many areas of the world. As drilling water depths increase, the potential for natural gas hydrate formation during drilling operations also increases. Hydrates are solid mixtures of natural gas and water that resemble dirty ice in appearance. Unlike ice, however, they can form at temperatures well above 32°F [0°C] when sufficient pressure is present. The higher seafloor hydrostatic pressures and lower environmental temperatures encountered in deepwater drilling increase the likelihood of hydrate formation in chokelines, drilling risers, blowout preventers (BOP's), and subsea wellheads. This paper describes two cases in which gas hydrates formed in subsea equipment during drilling operations, leading to costly delays and special remedial procedures.Properties of HydratesHydrates were first observed by Davy in 1810.1 They were introduced to the petroleum industry in 1934 by Hammerschmidt,2 who determined that these substances were responsible for the freezing of gas transmission lines. Hydrates are part of a group of substances known as clathrates because they consist of "host" molecules (water) that form a lattice structure that acts like a cage to entrap "guest" gas molecules. C1, C2, C3, C4, H2S, and CO2 are known to produce hydrates with water. Hydrocarbons larger than nC5 cannot form hydrates with water because of limited host-molecule cage size. A noteworthy property of hydrates is the amount of gas trapped in a given volume. One ft3 [0.028 m3] of hydrate can contain as much as 170 scf [4.8 std m3] of gas. When hydrates decompose because of reduced pressure and/or increased temperature, they can produce a large volume of gas. If hydrates decompose in a limited-volume, sealed container, such as a core barrel, very high pressures that can rupture the container can be generated.Combinations of pressure and temperature that allow natural gases and water to form stable hydrates have been determined accurately. A major factor that affects hydrate formation is the natural gas composition. Fig. 1,3 a result of early hydrate research, illustrates how gas composition, i.e., specific gravity, can affect the pressure/temperature range where hydrates are stable. A second factor that affects hydrate formation is the liquid-phase composition. Many substances, when added to the liquid phase, will depress hydrate formation temperature at a given pressure.Pressure/temperature conditions under which hydrates are stable are well-established in comparison with present knowledge concerning time and conditions needed to form a hydrate initially. Recent work in this area determined that the time to form a hydrate depends on several factors, including the degree of supercooling.4 Supercooling occurs when the actual temperature of a gas/liquid mixture is lower than hydrate-equilibrium temperature at a given pressure.Deepwater DrillingDrilling water-depth records increased greatly during the last decade; the number of wells drilled worldwide in deep water, however, is still limited (see Figs. 2 and 35-12). Through 1986, about 150 wells worldwide have been drilled safely in water more than 2,000 ft [610 m] deep.The potential of gas-hydrate formation during deepwater drilling operations has been recognized.1 The actual formation of hydrates, however, has not been reported. Possible explanations for the absence of reports are that (1) the industry's deepwater-well drilling experience is limited; (2) the likelihood of conditions favorable for hydrate formation - i.e., sufficient quantities of natural gas and water combined with the right pressure and temperature conditions - is low; and (3) the lack of understanding and recognition of hydrates leads to the attribution of well difficulties to other causes - e.g., barite settling and mechanical failures.Temperature GradientsWith increasing water depth, static seawater temperature normally declines in a roughly parabolic manner. For the Gulf of Mexico,14 the average seawater temperature (see Fig. 4) drops rapidly to about 48°F at 1,500 ft [9°C at 457 m]. Below this depth, the water temperature drops more slowly to about 40°F at 3,000 ft [4°C at 914 m].Case Histories of Deepwater Hydrate OccurrencesCase 1.Case 1 describes an occurrence of hydrates in a well located at 1,150-ft [350-m] water depth off the U.S. west coast with a seawater temperature of 45°F [7°C] at the mudline. Fig. 5 shows the casing strings in this wellbore. After 7-in. [17.78-cm] casing was run and cemented, the subsea casing hanger packoff was set and pressure tested. The BOP's were round-tripped from the ocean floor to change BOP ram sizes. While cement was drilled at the casing shoe, low gas units were detected. This increased sporadically. The BOP's were closed and casing pressure was increased to 1,300 psi [8964 kPa]. A through-drillstring noise log indicated that a gas influx was occurring from a sand at 7,750 ft [2362 m]. Gas was entering from the formation, channeling through the primary cement column, and migrating up the 7×9 5/8-in. [17.78×24.45-cm] casing annulus. The wellhead hanger packoff was leaking (even though it had been pressure tested), allowing the migrating gas to enter the freshwater mud at the subsea wellhead. An unsuccessful attempt to recover the BOP wear bushing while holding pressure on the well was made. Hydrates may have prevented the retrieval of the wear bushing. Recovery of the wear bushing would have allowed access to the leaking casing-hanger packoff. Attempts to pump mud into the 7×9 5/8-in. [17.78×24.45-cm] casing annulus with pressures up to 3,000 psi [20.7 MPa] were unsuccessful. (Subsequent investigation of the casing-hanger packoff revealed that the packoff had not reached its correct setting position, probably because of debris in the wellhead. The result of the improperly set packoff was a seal that held only from above and not from below.)To stop the gas influx, we decided to perforate the casing just above the gas sand and to pump heavyweight mud into the formation. To ensure a successful casing perforating job, the drillstring was severed and stripped up through the BOP's until the severed drillstring end was above the gas sand. A through drillstring perforating gun was then run to shoot the 7-in. [17.78-cm] casing just above the gas sand. The gas influx was killed by pumping 14.2-lbm/gal [1702-kg/m3] mud down the drillstring and into the formation at surface pressures up to 3,100 psi [21.4 MPa]. At the conclusion of the kill operation, approximately 7 days after gas was first detected, both the chokeline and the kill line were found plugged. Subsequent operations were hampered by the inability to use either line. Numerous attempts to unplug the chokeline and the kill line by applying pressure surges at the surface were unsuccessful.After cementing operations, which secured the wellbore, the BOP's were recovered. Hydrates and trapped gas were found in the chokeline and the kill line of the bottom eight riser joints.Case 1.Case 1 describes an occurrence of hydrates in a well located at 1,150-ft [350-m] water depth off the U.S. west coast with a seawater temperature of 45°F [7°C] at the mudline. Fig. 5 shows the casing strings in this wellbore. After 7-in. [17.78-cm] casing was run and cemented, the subsea casing hanger packoff was set and pressure tested. The BOP's were round-tripped from the ocean floor to change BOP ram sizes. While cement was drilled at the casing shoe, low gas units were detected. This increased sporadically. The BOP's were closed and casing pressure was increased to 1,300 psi [8964 kPa]. A through-drillstring noise log indicated that a gas influx was occurring from a sand at 7,750 ft [2362 m]. Gas was entering from the formation, channeling through the primary cement column, and migrating up the 7×9 5/8-in. [17.78×24.45-cm] casing annulus. The wellhead hanger packoff was leaking (even though it had been pressure tested), allowing the migrating gas to enter the freshwater mud at the subsea wellhead. An unsuccessful attempt to recover the BOP wear bushing while holding pressure on the well was made. Hydrates may have prevented the retrieval of the wear bushing. Recovery of the wear bushing would have allowed access to the leaking casing-hanger packoff. Attempts to pump mud into the 7×9 5/8-in. [17.78×24.45-cm] casing annulus with pressures up to 3,000 psi [20.7 MPa] were unsuccessful. (Subsequent investigation of the casing-hanger packoff revealed that the packoff had not reached its correct setting position, probably because of debris in the wellhead. The result of the improperly set packoff was a seal that held only from above and not from below.)To stop the gas influx, we decided to perforate the casing just above the gas sand and to pump heavyweight mud into the formation. To ensure a successful casing perforating job, the drillstring was severed and stripped up through the BOP's until the severed drillstring end was above the gas sand. A through drillstring perforating gun was then run to shoot the 7-in. [17.78-cm] casing just above the gas sand. The gas influx was killed by pumping 14.2-lbm/gal [1702-kg/m3] mud down the drillstring and into the formation at surface pressures up to 3,100 psi [21.4 MPa]. At the conclusion of the kill operation, approximately 7 days after gas was first detected, both the chokeline and the kill line were found plugged. Subsequent operations were hampered by the inability to use either line. Numerous attempts to unplug the chokeline and the kill line by applying pressure surges at the surface were unsuccessful.After cementing operations, which secured the wellbore, the BOP's were recovered. Hydrates and trapped gas were found in the chokeline and the kill line of the bottom eight riser joints.

AB  - Current oil prices have shifted the offshore flow assurance philosophy from "hydrate avoidance" to "hydrate management". In order to manage hydrate formation in the pipeline, not only do we need to have a good understanding of the hydrate formation process, but also a comprehensive hydrate formation predictive tool is necessary. In this work, a transient hydrate simulation tool coupled with a multiphase flow simulator, which predicts the hydrate formation rate and amount to determine hydrate slurry transportability, is applied to assess the hydrate formation risk in an offshore gas condensate subsea tieback under design stage. A simulation model is developed using the geometry, fluid properties and predicted production data from this field. This gas condensate field has an offshore separator that connects to a subsea production line. After separation, gas and liquids are transported by export lines. In this study, the hydrate formation in the production and the liquid export lines was estimated using the transient hydrate simulation tool. Simulation studies were performed to assess the hydrate plugging risk at both steady state and transient operations considering different water cuts. This simulation tool has been demonstrated to be useful in modeling hydrate management during subsea pipeline design and optimization, and can provide guidelines for safe and cost-effective hydrate management in the field.

AB  - We have observed P-wave seismic anisotropy at the south summit of Hydrate Ridge (HR), Cascadia convergent margin, offshore Oregon, on walkaway vertical seismic profiles and ocean bottom seismometer data. Models based on the assumption of vertical transverse isotropy (VTI), require the vertical velocity to be higher than the horizontal velocity that is uncommon in the conventional sand-shale formations. Since HR is characterized by high velocity hydrate veins, emulating vertical layering, an HTI model (TI with a horizontal axis of symmetry) seems more appropriate. Our anisotropy analysis consists of two-steps, 1) building of 2D anisotropic model comprising homogeneous layers based on the traveltime-error-contour analysis assuming VTI and HTI medium, and 2) derivation of continuously varying heterogeneous model using a rigorous traveltime inversion with very-fast simulated annealing. Based on our result we established relationships between P-wave anisotropic parameters and distribution of gas hydrate and free gas at HR. Observed P-wave anisotropy are, 1) 11% (N-S) to 15% (E-W) in the layer A (from sea floor to 70 meter below sea floor) containing heterogeneous hydrate veins, 2) 7% (N-S) to 10% (E-W) in the layer B (from layer A to bottom simulating reflector) containing relatively homogeneous hydrate and 3) 3% in the layer C (gas-bearing sediments below layer B). Anisotropy values are proportional to the hydrate concentration at the HR. Distribution and concentration of gas-hydrates can be further used for studying possibilities of gas-hydrate as a geohazard, an economic energy source, and a cause for world margin stability and climate change.

AB  - In this study, a computer-aided system for effective hydrate management is presented. A flowchart was developed to suggest possible intervention approaches to follow in the event that hydrates are restricting flow in flowlines. Using VBA® in Excel, a worksheet was developed to serve as a direct means of proposing an intervention approach to adopt after confirming the cause(s) of hydrate formation in the flowline that is monitored. The worksheet created suggests intervention approaches in a matter of seconds after a series of prompts to input the identified causative agents. The main causative agents considered were hydrate formation temperature (HFT), hydrate formation pressure (HFP) and Sufficient Gas/Water. Six scenarios of causative agent occurrences were considered. Scenario 1 was a combination of HFT, HFP and sufficient gas/water, the proposed intervention was to depressurize, heat flowline, carry out chemical inhibition and dehydrate. Scenario 2 was a combination of HFP and HFT, the intervention proposed was to depressurize, heat flowline and carry out inhibition. Scenario 3 was HFP only, the intervention strategy proposed was to depressurize and carry out chemical inhibition. Scenario 4 was a combination of HFT and sufficient gas/water, the proposed intervention was to heat flowline, carry out chemical inhibition and dehydrate. Scenario 5 was HFT only, the proposed intervention strategy was to heat flowline, carry out chemical inhibition. Scenario 6 was a combination of no HFP, HFT or sufficient gas/water, the proposed intervention was that the causative elements be checked again since hydrate presence in the flowline had been previously confirmed.

AB  - ABSTRACTThe mechanical properties of hydrate bearing sediments may deteriorate as a result of hydrate dissociation due to heating of the wellbore casing, with possible adverse effects on the stability of the casing. The authors have created a numerical model in plane strain in order to simulate the stability of a well-bore supported with a casing. The model captures the interaction between the formation, casing, cement and cement-casing bond. The simulation results demonstrate that the safety factor of the casing is very dependent on the quality of the cement, for with strong cement, it is multiples of the safety factor of the casing with weak cement. The safety factor for the casing with weak cement, in the presence of hydrates in the formation, reduces due to hydrate dissociation and the subsequent deterioration of the mechanical strength of the formation. This paper shows that in this case an effective cement placement around the casing becomes crucial in order to keep the casing factor within acceptable limits.INTRODUTIONCasing deformation resulting from reservoir compaction and surface subsidence during the primary production stage has been analysed and reported by many investigators 1,2,3. Generally the following effects can be considered: Pressure depletion in the formation, which can lead to subsidence and possible shearing of the casing Heating the formation, which can generate high stresses in the formation Deterioration of the sediment mechanical properties due to heating as for hydrate bearing sediments, which can induce large stress in the casing.Casing integrity for well drilled in hydrate bearing sediments presents a challenge that is explored in this paper. Gas hydrate, or clathrates, are ice-like deposits containing a mixture of water and gas, the most common gas being methane. Other gases of small molecular size such as CO2? H2S, ethane and higher hydrocarbons are also found in natural gas hydrates. Gas hydrates are stable under high pressure and low temperature conditions, and hence they can be found in deepwater settings at relatively shallow depths below the seafloor and in permafrost regions 4. The dissociation of gas hydrates can take place due to a reduction in pressure and /or an increase in temperature, or due to the injection of certain chemicals that may affect hydrate stability. Once melted due to the circulation of hot fluid in the casing. Hydrate bearing sediments will suffer degradation in their mechanical properties (e.g, strength and stiffness), accompanied by overpressure development . Moreover the gas released by hydrate dissociation may undermine the quality of the cement supporting the casing (if dissociation takes place before the cement is fully cured ) and hence reduce the collapse resistance of the casing6. This the well by the surrounding sediments in response to heating. Some of the sediment considered are hydrate bearing sediments (HBS). The cements examined could be strong cement (foam cement) or weaker cement (hard cement). The cement-casing bond strength is investigated in the modelling. The modelling is performed using FLAC3D, which is a continuum code developed by Itasca Consulting Group 7,8.

AB  - AbstractTraditional hydrate inhibitors such as methanol and glycols have been in use for many years, but at today's oil prices the demand for cheaper methods of inhibition will be required. The development of alternative, cost-effective and environmentally acceptable hydrate inhibitors is a technological challenge for the oil and gas production industry. These new hydrate inhibitors can lead to very substantial cost savings, not only for the reduced cost of the new inhibitor but also in the size of the injection, pumping and storage facilities. Thus it is possible to redesign production facilities on a smaller scale. A few chemicals have been tested in field trials already with mixed success. Certainly, there is room for more active and cheaper inhibitors. We will review the relative merits of the two main types of hydrate inhibitor, "kinetic inhibitors" and "anti-agglomerators" regarding their applicability, and discuss how test results obtained in the laboratory compare to real field trials. We will also describe new techniques for comparing the effectiveness and activity of new hydrate inhibitors and present laboratory results on various chemicals. Patented examples will also be mentioned. Finally, a comparison of model systems with real fluids with regards to hydrate formation and inhibition will be given.IntroductionThe oil industry is more than ever on the look-out for cheaper methods for producing oil and gas. In some mature basins such as the North Sea, to maintain the same level of production as today the oil industry must find cheap solutions to building out the many small and medium fields that have already been discovered. Many of these smaller fields could be built out with underwater installations and coupled to existing platforms. One cheap solution for such fields could be sub-sea multiphase production. This requires knowledge of multiphase flow as well as cheap inhibitor technology for hydrates, wax, corrosion, scale etc. In this case, the cost of inhibiting hydrate formation can be an important factor, even more so in deep water production.Besides chemical treatment and the use of pipeline insulation, a novel method is being developed for a field in the UK sector of the North Sea. This involves maintaining the produced fluids outside the hydrate region by having an outside jacket around the production line into which hot water is injected from the platform.Gas Hydrate StructuresGas hydrates can form several structures. If one is trying to prevent hydrate formation in production, it can be important to know which structure you are dealing with. The most well-known and most researched hydrate structures are called Structure I and Structure II. Structure H is a third form which was more recently discovered and has attracted attention as it contains a large cavity that can hold larger molecules than either structure I or II, e.g. some saturated cyclic hydrocarbons such as cyclopentane. Evidence for Structure H was found in a natural gas hydrate collected from the sea floor in the Gulf of Mexico. However, no proof yet exists that Structure H forms in oil or gas production lines.Which hydrate structure is formed depends mainly on the gas molecules, their size relative to the cavity, and the relative stabilities of the structures. The chemical nature and shape of the guest molecule may also influence the type of structure, Both methane and ethane form structure I hydrates. Methane can occupy both the small and large cavities of this structure but the filling of the small cavities that provides the major stabilising effects. With pure ethane gas the molecules only fit the larger of the two cavities in structure I. The larger hydrocarbon gas molecules, propane, n-butane (with a smaller hydrate former) and iso-butane, form hydrates of structure II entering only the large cavities (which are larger than the large cavities in structure I). A typical natural gas production mixture containing Cl-C4 components will preferentially form structure II hydrates.P. 531

AB  - AbstractThe economic development of many multiphase flow production systems requires a full understanding production systems requires a full understanding of hydrates and their control. BP Exploration has recognised this and has set itself the goal of developing the necessary understanding and ability to deal with hydrates and hydrate forming systems. Three key areas have been targeted for investigation to develop the tools necessary to optimise the economics of hydrate forming systems. An important advance by BP in the first of these key areas is presented. The new BP phase equilibrium hydrate formulation is used to rigorously examine options for using a range of pure and mixed inhibitors. THE NATURE OF THE CHALLENGE BackgroundProducing oil and gas from offshore discoveries Producing oil and gas from offshore discoveries which are increasingly difficult to commercialise is probably the biggest challenge to the petroleum industry in the North Sea today. This petroleum industry in the North Sea today. This is a natural consequence of a maturing exploration province. In general, the undeveloped hydrocarbon deposits are becoming smaller, deeper (both in terms of water and reservoir depths) and are increasingly likely to be lore highly pressured and of higher gas to oil ratio. In pressured and of higher gas to oil ratio. In some cases the field cannot be fully produced from one location alone, but, at the sane time, the economics cannot support the cost of more than one or two main producing structures. In many cases the way to economic exploitation is seen to be through the development of subsea or minimal surface facility tie-backs. This invariably requires extended multiphase transportation of water wet hydrocarbons to a central processing facility. In these circumstances processing facility. In these circumstances multiphase flow and hydrates are very Important, if not dominant, issues. There are a wide variety of possible production scenarios involving hydrate forming systems. Some of the main examples of these are shown in figure 1. The Almost Empty Tool Box Why do hydrates present problems in the design and operation of the production systems described in figure 1? The simple answer is that not enough is known about them and engineers do not have the tools to design systems reliably enough to ensure that they do not form and, when they do, to deal with them without losing revenue. The tools that engineers can currently call upon to tackle the hydrate problem are designed to predict the equilibrium conditions under which predict the equilibrium conditions under which hydrates will form, and they do little else. As a result they leave the engineer little scope to ply his trade. ply his trade. This lack of information and the limited basis on which the current hydrate predictors are formulated can lead to misunderstanding about hydrate formation. For example, it is a commonly held belief that free water must first be present for a hydrate to form. This assertion is not borne out by experiment nor is it thermodynamically justified. It is, however, an implicit condition of some of the current hydrate predictors which make use of this as a device simply to improve their tractability. The effect of this can be quite serious in practice and can result in errors of judgement in the design of hydrate forming systems. There is also the danger of assuming that phase equilibrium (a fundamental assumption of almost all models) applies at the process level. For example, let us consider the use of glycol for the inhibition of hydrates in a long multiphase pipeline. The effectiveness of the inhibitor in pipeline. The effectiveness of the inhibitor in the other phases is presumed by virtue of phase equilibrium conditions at the local level. No account is taken of the effective separation of phases and the actual presence, or the lack of phases and the actual presence, or the lack of presence, of the inhibitor in these phases, yet presence, of the inhibitor in these phases, yet the predicted hydrate depression temperature is sometimes mistakenly believed to hold true for the system as a whole. A practical, if extreme, example of this is a vertical impulse line which leads from a flow line containing a wet gas with an involatile inhibitor. Unless the dead leg of the impulse line is fully protected (lagged and heat traced), hydrates are bound to form which will block or create a false signal. P. 147

AB  - AbstractAvoidance of hydrates plugs formation is one of the main challenges of Flow Assurance in Oil & Gas Industry. To do so the usual approach is to avoid entering the gas hydrate thermodynamic zone by various means: thermal insulation, heating, massive injection of thermodynamic inhibitors, dehydration of effluents. This is very efficient but is becoming very expensive with harsher & deeper offshore fields and it has proven to be a very conservative approach, as there is not always a direct link between some hydrate crystals formation and getting a hydrate plug.Production with care inside the hydrate P&T zone is a major new trend in Oil & Gas field developments. In order to ascertain such production mode, it is required to develop new monitoring instruments in order to get more precise information regarding the hydrate plugging risks during production inside hydrate P&T zone.Such activity has been studied through a Joint Industry Project at the Heriot-Watt University since 2005 sponsored by Oil & Gas Companies. Some instruments and/or techniques have been developed by the JIP and two of them have been implemented on three gas/condensate fields in Europe & Middle-East from 2008 to 2014. This paper presents two of such hydrate monitoring instruments/techniques and the field tests results.

AB  - Abstract Natural gas hydrate is a potential resource to meet the ever-increasing energy demand. Yet wellbore/pipeline blockage due to hydrate regeneration poses serious safety hazards during gas hydrate production. In order to estimate and effectively manage the blockage risk, we studied the hydrate regeneration behavior in wellbore during hydrate production. A method is developed to predict where gas hydrates regenerate (i.e. the hydrate regeneration region, HRGR) in the wellbore. The HRGRs with different production methods were studied. The results indicate that hydrates regenerate in wellbore. The hydrates can deposit onto the wall of the production tubing and form a growing solid layer, which narrows the tubing and even reults in complete blockage. The simulation work indicates that there tends to be a rather large HRGR in the production tubing regardless what production methods are adopted. The blockage risk is usually much higher in the region where a higher subcooling is encountered. This region is the high blockage risk region (HBRR). For the depressurization method, the HRGR shrinks as the depressurization amplitude increases. Accordingly, the HBRR and most vulnerable site become shallower. Therefore, the blockage risk is reduced. Similar trend is found as the thermal/chemical injection methods are used. However, for thermal injection and chemical injection, there are no significant change in the HBRRs and the most vulnerable sites. Only an unnoticeable slight upward trend is found for the thermal injection cases.

AB  - Abstract A number of gas fields have been developed in the Middle East, Offshore Western Australia and in the Asia-Pacific region for the last five years as the demand for Liquefied Natural Gas (LNG) has grown tremendously worldwide. Most of these gas field production systems consist of long subsea flowlines, which are flowing with three phase fluids gas, condensate and water. The cold temperatures of the subsea environment pose a flow assurance risk to production, especially for hydrate blockages. The only solution currently being considered to address the risk for hydrate blockages in gas fields is the usage of Kinetic Hydrate Inhibitors (KHIs), not Anti-Agglomerate Low Dose Hydrate Inhibitors (AAHIs). The most significant production concern for all producers associated with this production scenario is that the performance of the KHI is compromised in the presence of the Corrosion Inhibitor (CI). The reason for not considering the AAHIs for this application, whose performance is not compromised by the corrosion inhibitor, is the general belief that these chemistries are predominantly water soluble and therefore increase the toxicity of the produced water. The published literature to-date is focused on understanding the interactions between the KHI and the CI chemistries to solve the incompatibility issue. The lack of literature to-date showcasing the success of such an understanding warrants a solution with a different perspective. Data is available for new generation chemistries currently being used in the industry that show greater than 99% oil solubility and would hence overcome the toxicity concern that was valid for the first generation AAHI chemistry. This new generation chemistry was tested by Heriot-Watt University in the United Kingdom (UK) that shows the product effectiveness up to 90% water cut at a reasonable subcooling, applicable for these subsea flowlines in discussion. The performance at these high water cuts will make this new generation chemistry more applicable for these subsea flowlines without the risk of hydrate blockages. Introduction Gas hydrates are solid inclusions that are similar to ice in appearance but differ in structure. Under certain conditions of high pressure and low temperature, water physically entraps the molecules of a hydrate-former inside a hydrogen bonded solid lattice. Hydrate-formers include nitrogen, carbon dioxide, hydrogen sulfide, methane, ethane, propane and butane and are the main components of natural gas (Makogon 1998; Sloan 1998). Gas hydrates are not stable at ambient temperature and pressure. Hydrate agglomerationss can be even formed with low concentrations of water. To protect a system against gas hydrate formation, the right chemical at the right dose rate needs to be injected into the system. Currently there are two mechanisms of low-dose hydrate inhibition available as an alternative to Thermodynamic Hydrate Inhibitors (THIs); Anti-Agglomerate Hydrate Inhibitors (AAHIs) and KHIs. The AAHIs and KHIs are normally classified as Low Dosage Hydrate Inhibitors (LDHIs).

AB  - Abstract The conditions for initial hydrate formation in systems containing carbon dioxide, propane and water were obtained over a wide concentration range for the hydrate-water-rich liquid-gas phase region. The locus of the four-phase equilibrium consisting of hydrate, water-rich liquid, gas and propane - carbon dioxide - rich liquid was determined. The maximum temperature at which hydrates would form in the three-component system was found to be 57.7 °F, compared to 50_3 DF for pure carbon dioxide and 42.3 °F for pure propane. An analysis of the data in terms of the solid-vapour K-factor concept indicated that the If-factors reported for propa.ne do not apply in systems containing carbon dioxide.INTRODUCTIONA GAS HYDRATE is an inclusion compound in which water and at least one other component are associated through the enclosure of the hydrate-forming molecules in a crystalline lattice-like structure formed by the water molecules. The process of hydrate formation may be represented by:(Equation Available In Full Paper)where a hydrate-forming gas, R, combines with n molecules of water to form the solid crystalline hydrate. The forces stabilizing the structure are physical in nature, and the value of n may theoretically vary from 5.75 to over 17.0, depending on the hydrate-forming molecule and the structure of hydrate formed (1).Many of the organic and inorganic gases form stable hydrates. These include, for example, carbon dioxide, hydrogen sulphide, methane, ethane, propane and nitrogen, all of which are commonly found in naturally occurring gas reservoirs. For this reason, information on the hydrate-forming conditions of these gases and their mixtures is of importance to the natural gas handling and processing industries. Although extensive experimental work has been reported in the literature on hydrate formation for the pure components, far less information is available on mixtures. Some of the systems for which information is available include methane - hydrogen sulphide(2), methane - carbon dioxide(3). methane-nitrogen(4), methane-propane(5) and propane hydrogen sulphide(6). Initial hydrate formation in several natural gas mixtures is reported by Deaton and Frost(7,8).As an extension of the work reported above, it was decided to study initial hydrate formation in a system containing carbon dioxide and propane. Both of these components are commonly found in natural gas; furthermore, the system is of interest from a phase behaviour point of view, because pure carbon dioxide and pure propane form hydrates in different crystal structures.Hydrate Structure And Phase BehaviourThe crystal structures in which hydrates are formed have been classified as Structure I and Structure II by Claussen(9) and von Stackelberg(10,11) and the theory pertaining to this is extensively reviewed by van derWaals and Platteeuw12. In this classification, carbon dioxide, a smaller molecule, forms in Structure I and propane, a somewhat larger molecule, forms in Structure II. The ternary system containing water, propane and carbon-dioxide exhibits two four-phase equilibrium consisting in one case of hydrate II (Hir), water-rich liquid (L1), gas (G) and propane - carbon dioxide - rich liquid (L2) and, in the other case, of hydrate I (Hr), water-rich liquid (L1), gas (G) and propane - carbon dioxide - rich liquid (L2).

AB  - Deepwater natural gas hydrate resources potentially exceed all other conventional and non-conventional hydrocarbon resources on a world-wide basis. However, before these offshore gas hydrate resources can be classified as reserves, it must be demonstrated that gas hydrates can be produced under conditions that make economic sense. The purpose of this paper is to provide an overview of the technical issues that will challenge the development of deepwater natural gas hydrates.

AB  - Abstract This paper presents a practical approach to commercial production of gas hydrates. The background and current status of hydrates is reviewed. Concepts for exploration and production of methane resources are presented. Conceptual and procedural techniques are included.Introduction Attention is focused on gas hydrates as petroleum reserves dwindle and the price of fuel rises rapidly. Figure 1, the cover of National Geographic, June 2004, states bluntly "The End of Cheap Oil". Oil is a mainstay of society and general well being in the modern world. Reshuffling of the world's economy at this very moment is rapidly changing political, social, and military relationships creating grave doubt for the future. National Geographic, hardly an alarmist publication, is best known for its clear insight and candor.In keeping with naming periods of history The Stone Age, The Iron Age, etc., the present is The Oil Age and we are living in the latter day. The question is what will replace petroleum? Coal, water, atomic energy, though important--none can substitute for oil. When questioned by an American Oil & Gas reporter, October 2004, President Bush answered, "Devising methods to tap the massive energy potential of methane hydrates". The author accepts the President's challenge and this paper offers concepts to commercially produce methane.Major Considerations Hydrates, abundant in many coastal and polar regions, are a ready source of methane. The West can ill afford to continue as we are now, even if the world was at peace. We fueled WWI, WWII, and ensuing conflicts but fueling another major war is out of the question. As conflicts continue the US will simply go bankrupt. Much of the world will cheer. Modification of the old adage-"Land of the free and the home of the hated", is indeed true. Life as we know it will change inexorably if we fail to develop gas hydrates. The balance of political, economic, military, and social power will no longer be Western-dominated. There is no time to dally, time is of essence, the hour is late, and the West must hasten if global chaos and disaster are to be averted. To succeed we must organize a cooperative structure of governments, industries, and academia to commercially produce hydrates. However, currently cooperation is moving at an intolerably slow pace. The goal is singular--develop gas hydrates IMMEDIATELY!Nature has provided gas hydrates in abundance beneath the sea and on shore in polar regions. Occurrences are documented in offshore Florida, Georgia, and the Gulf of Mexico, as well as coastal areas around the globe. Figure 2 is a view of known hydrate occurrences. Figure 3 locates the Northern and Southern Hydrate Ridges off the coast of Oregon. In general hydrates occur along the base of the continental slope.NASA SeaSat program assessed marine resources. Differential scanning radiometers were developed that could detect sea surface evidence of hydrates below. Note Figure 4 indicates the presence of hydrates. This picture is not of hydrates but it is indicative of the type of readout that could indicate such deposits.

AB  - AbstractResearch efforts undertaken by the Morgantown Energy Technology Center, Department of Energy, have focused on the geologic assessment of gas hydrate deposits existing in two different settings (onshore and offshore). Preliminary assessments have been completed for the North slope of Alaska and the offshore east coast of the United States. Specific sites studied in the onshore setting were the Point Barrow, Kuparuk River, Prudhoe Bay, Cape Simpson, Cape Thompson, and Umiat areas of Alaska. The specific site for the offshore setting was the Blake-Bahama Outer Ridge area of the western Atlantic. This study demonstrates the use of geophysical, geological, and geochemical techniques and data to locate and evaluate the potential gas hydrate resource of these two settings.IntroductionThis study was initiated to evaluate the geologic factors that control the formation and detection of gas-hydrates within onshore and offshore environments. This study focused on two areas where gas hydrates are known to occur: the Alaskan North Slope (onshore) and the U.S. east coast continental margins (offshore).It is known that gas hydrates are a type of inclusion compound, or clathrate, formed as a solid, ice-like mixture of gas and water in which gas molecules are trapped within a framework of water molecules (see Figure 1). Water and natural gas, under certain conditions of temperature and pressure, can form naturally occurring gas hydrates in sediments underlying ocean basins and within or adjacent to permafrost regions.Because gas hydrates form under conditions of relatively low temperatures and high pressures, two opposing factors control the formation and distribution of gas hydrates in the Earth, given sufficient quantities of gas and water. The first is the geothermal gradient, or temperature increase associated with increasing crustal depth. Average continental gradients are generally 2 to 3Â°C/100 m, while offshore geothermal gradients average 3.6Â°C/100 m in the western Atlantic. Because hydrates are generally stable under conditions of relatively low temperatures, the geothermal gradient limits hydrate formation and existence to relatively shallow, cooler regions of the Earth's crust.The second factor that controls the distribution of hydrate regimes is the pressure gradient, or pressure increase associated with increasing water and/or crustal depth. Average pressure gradients are generally 10.1 kPa/m. Because hydrates are generally stable under conditions of relatively high pressures, the pressure gradient limits hydrate formation and existence to depths below 300 m in continental areas and 500 m (minimum water depth) in offshore areas. Therefore, because of the opposing factors of pressure and temperature, there is a defined region where hydrates are stable called the hydrate stability zone (HSZ) (see Figure 2).The source of methane for gas-hydrate formation may be either biogenic or thermogenic. Biogenic methane results from the microbial breakdown of organic matter in shallow sediment; thermogenic methane comes from the thermal alteration of organic matter in sediment at depth. Because gas hydrates occur in shallow sediment, biogenic sources are often indicated, especially for gas hydrates of outer continental margins (Kvenvolden and Barnard, 1983). Where gas migration pathways are available from deep within the sedimentary section, thermogenic gas may also form hydrates.

Introduction Deepwater developments such as the one depicted in Fig 1 rely on production flowlines to carry raw, production flowlines to carry raw, unprocessed reservoir fluid, called full wellstream (FWS) production, from wells to production facilities. As the search for reserves has taken the petroleum industry into deeper water and colder environments, the feasibility of producing FWS lay become questionable due to the possibility of hydrates in the flowlines. possibility of hydrates in the flowlines. The lower capital investment of FWS production flowlines is also attractive production flowlines is also attractive in shallower water. Even here, the risk of hydrates raises questions of feasibility in shallow, cold water environments. When hydrates form in production streams, they can pose problems with economic consequences. Field experience indicates that hydrates occasionally obstruct production flowpaths (Ref 1 and 2). In the event of a partial obstruction, hydrate formation is a nuisance, slowing the production stream until the obstruction can be removed. And, in the event of a complete obstruction, full stoppage of production can last for weeks while production can last for weeks while mobilizing equipment to remove the obstruction. The cost of the mobilization on top of the lost revenue from the interruption in production can have serious economic production can have serious economic repercussions. Figure 2 is a hydrate formation curve for a crude oil reservoir fluid with a gas-oil-ration (GOR) of 1000 SCF/STB (177 SCM/STCM). Note that increasing pressure or decreasing temperature favours hydrate formation. The worst exposure to hydrate formation usually is associated with a prolonged interruption in prolonged interruption in production, when the pressure rises production, when the pressure rises to shut-in wellhead pressure (SIWHP) and the contents of the flowline cool to seabed temperature. While hydrate formation will be more likely in deep water, even at typical seabed temperatures in the North Sea (40-45 degrees F or 4-7 degrees C), hydrate formation is possible. 2 HYDRATE MITIGATION STUDY A study was conducted to identify methods of supporting FWS production in a hydrate forming environment. The study was set in the context of the system depicted in Fig 1 to exploit an oil field yielding a crude with a GOR of 1000 SCF/STB (177 SCM/STCM). The water depth at the field location was 2000 ft (610m). The temperature on the seabed was 38 degrees F (3.3 degrees C). The search for hydrate mitigating techniques was confined to existing technology. Only those alternatives which were both feasible and cost effective were carried through the study. Feasibility and cost effectiveness were weighed for the whole path from the wells through the production facilities. The field development plan specified water injection to maintain reservoir pressure. Since gas sales had been pressure. Since gas sales had been ruled out, produced gas would be reinjected into the reservoir. A portion of the wells at the multiwell portion of the wells at the multiwell subsea templates were designated as water injection wells and gas injection wells. The single satellite wells were production wells. All satellite wells and template wells were completed for through-flowline (TFL) maintenance. The single satellite wells required a pair of 3-1/2-inch (90mm) TFL pair of 3-1/2-inch (90mm) TFL flowlines which doubled as FWS production flowlines. Each template production flowlines. Each template required a total of five lines to connect it with the riser based manifold:

AB  - SummaryThis paper will review the design considerations for gas hydrate prevention in deepwater well completions. The influence of seafloor temperature, wellbore pressure, water production rate and composition of gas on hydrate inhibition system design will be discussed. The impact of various inhibitors will be discussed in relationship to the design of the system and potential handling problems. Examples will review design considerations for sizing of subsea inhibitor lines, selection of injection depth below the seafloor and hardware requirements. Case histories of inhibitor injection systems used in deepwater completions and during testing of deepwater exploration wells will be reviewed. The benefits of insulated tubing to enhance inhibition design will be discussed. Also, a method will be introduced that can be used to estimate the maximum inhibitor injection rate to avoid salt precipitation from completion fluid or produced water.IntroductionAs drilling and production operations expand into deepwater environments, operators need to consider the potential risk of gas hydrate formation in wellbores, subsea pipelines and subsea equipment during both drilling and production operations. Gas hydrates are ice-like solids that form from gas and water under combinations of high pressure and moderately low temperatures. The ice-like structure occurs when the water molecules form cage-like structures around the guest gas molecules. In deepwater wellbores and pipelines, gas hydrates can potentially form and plug flow passages. Figure 1 illustrates where hydrates can form in a deepwater well.There has been extensive research on gas hydrate formation during the drilling phase of deepwater wells. This paper, however, reviews the subject of gas hydrate formation in deepwater production and testing operations.The risk of forming hydrates is greatest when the well is cold. This condition usually occurs during production start-up or while the well is shut-down following a period of flow. Hydrates can also form while the well is flowing if the well temperature and pressure present the right conditions.There are several consequences of forming a hydrate plug:1. Well flow rate can be reduced significantly or production could completely stop.2. Plugs can make it difficult to run wireline tools down the tubing string.3. Hydrate plugs can make it difficult to open or close downhole valves to control the flow of produced fluids into the tubing or from the annulus.There are several possible solutions to mitigate the risk of hydrate plugging in deepwater production tests or deepwater completions: (1) a hydrate inhibitor can be injected into the wellbore; (2) the tubing can be insulated; (3) the wellbore can be heated. The most common solutions are to use inhibitors or insulation.

AB  - Abstract CO2 has been focused for improving recovery factor of methane hydrate. The most of the principle is replacing guest molecular. It is also known that CO2 hydrate formation generates a large amount of exothermic heat. This heat can warm sediments up to 10 degrees Celsius as one of heating method. But a problem is how to inject CO2 at near fields of methane hydrate formations. CO2 hydrate formed in sediment blocks the pore of sediments. Then CO2 cannot inject into sediments for about ten-year term. But it is possible to inject CO2 for long term by a thermo-dynamic principle of the stability zone of CO2 hydrate. We will present experimental results to prove the principle of CO2 injection into formations. 1. Introduction Methane hydrate is solid, and it doesn't flush and flow from production well. Methane hydrate must be dissolved into gas and water in sediments by lowering the water pressure of the sediments or by heating the sediments to flow out from production well. Research consortium for methane hydrate resources in Japan succeeded to onshore depressurization test at permafrost in Canada for 6 days, and the consortium estimated the resources in the east part of Nankai trough[1]. The first trial of offshore test in Nankai trough is planed in 2012. On the other hand, CO2-enhanced oil recovery is commercialized by injecting CO2 into oil wells in the U.S. to enlarge oil production [2]. This method mitigates CO2 release into atmosphere. A research development is therefore necessary for an enhanced recovery of methane hydrate by using CO2. There is a problem of productivity by dropping of temperature for methane hydrate production by depressurization, because dissolving methane hydrate is endothermic reaction. It absorbs heat. Combining a heating method as an option to the depressurization to warm sediments, the productivity would be kept for long term. The recovery factor can also be expected to enlarge by the heating method. The productivity and the recovery factor are very important for commercialization of methane hydrate production. However, if we use fossil energy for the heating method, production rate, which is produced energy over input energy, become small. Then new technical developments are necessary for heating sediments for commercialization.  We focused that CO2 hydrate formation is exothermic reaction, and we have proposed a heating method using heat of CO2 hydrate formation [4,5]. Sediments can be warmed up to 10 degrees Celsius when the pressure is more than or equal to 4.5 MPa to accelerate dissolving methane hydrate. CO2 works as heating energy of sediments in this case.  Blockage of gas transportation pipeline cased by gas hydrate was reported in 1934. If CO2 is injected in to sediments, CO2 hydrate is formed and it blocks the pore of sediments in the same manner. Then CO2 can't inject into sediments. A subject for applying the heating method using exothermic heat of CO2 hydrate formation is to show a method to inject CO2 in to sediments continuously for long terms. The point of this method is using equilibrium state. No CO2 hydrate formation and dissolving are occurred. It balanced on the boundary of CO2 hydrate stability zone. Then the pore is kept opening for flow. Also the temperature of the formations is kept at 10 degrees Celsius by formation and dissolving of CO2 hydrate naturally. Then CO2 can inject into sediments continuously for long terms by using the equilibrium state. When the pressure is more than or equal to 4.5 MPa, the temperature of the equilibrium state is 10 degrees Celsius. In the following chapter, the principle of CO2 injection into formation continuously for long terms is verified by experiments are presented.

AB  - AbstractLaboratory and field results have confirmed the advantages of kinetic gas hydrate inhibitors compared to classical thermodynamic inhibition methods. Kinetic inhibitors being used currently are high molecular weight water soluble polymers and they require a polar carrier solvent. In situations where the solvent is allowed to evaporate, i.e. hot spots in a gas pipeline, the solid polymer will plate out of the solution and may cause problems. This paper describes new low molecular weight kinetic gas hydrate inhibitors. These newly developed products, being liquid, will not plate out of solutions, can be used either in a polar solvent or a hydrocarbon carrier. Simulated hydrates laboratory testing has been done on a tetrahydrofuran/salt water system in a simple and unique testing loop. Comparable laboratory results were obtained for experimental and established kinetics gas hydrate inhibitors. Positive laboratory results were followed with successful field testing. Laboratory and field results indicate the experimental inhibitors have potential commercial applications in gas hydrate prevention technology.IntroductionGas hydrates form when water molecules crystallize around guest molecules. The water/guest cocrystallization process has been recognized for several years, is well characterized and occurs with sufficient combinations of temperature and pressure. Significant amounts of natural gas are deposited in the form of hydrates and are considered as future energy sources.Light hydrocarbons, methane-to-heptanes, nitrogen, carbon dioxide and hydrogen sulfide are the guest molecules of interest to the natural gas industry. Depending on the pressure and gas composition, gas hydrates may build up at any place where water coexists with natural gas at temperatures as high as 80 F. Long gas transmission lines are particularly vulnerable to being blocked with hydrates during extended cold weather conditions. Underwater pipelines and equipment may be exposed to hydrate forming conditions all the time. Extensive studies on gas hydrates were conducted by B. Dendy Sloan Jr. and coworkers at the Colorado School of Mines (CSM). These studies sponsored by several oil and gas companies included both the theoretical and practical aspects of hydrates and methods of hydrates inhibition. Gas hydrates are being studied worldwide at several research laboratories.There are few methods of preventing gas hydrates formation. The obvious ones like removing the water component, heating the system above the temperature of hydrate formation and lowering the pressure, are often not practical. Another method, the addition of large amounts of ethylene glycol or methanol, decreases the hydrate stability and effectively lowers the temperature of hydrate formation. The above mentioned methods are called thermodynamic inhibition because they destabilize water/gas clathrates by changing the composition or conditions. Thermodynamic inhibition with chemicals requires relatively large amounts of methanol and/or glycol; hence it is quite expensive.Kinetic methods of gas hydrates prevention have been developed by CSM and other laboratories. Kinetic inhibitors prevent a growth of hydrate nuclei to form larger crystals. Kinetic inhibitors are usually water-soluble copolymers. They are effective at concentrations typically ten to one hundred times less than the effective concentrations of ethylene glycol or methanol. With thermodynamic inhibitors increasing in price, the kinetic ones are becoming economically favorable. Known kinetic inhibitors like poly(N-vinylpyrrolidone (PVP), poly(N-vinylpyrrolidone/N-vinylcaprolactam/N,N-dimethylaminoethylmethacrylate (VC-713), poly(N-vinylcaprolactam) (PVCap) or poly(N-vinylpyrrolidone/Nvinylcaprolactam) (VP/VC) inhibit gas hydrates formation by coating and commingling with hydrate crystals nuclei, thereby interfering with agglomeration of small particles into large ones which would result in plugging the gas pipeline and equipment.P. 693^

This model allows prediction of the evolution of physical properties of the liquid phase during hydrate formation as the apparent viscosity, the density and the fraction of water converted into hydrate. Results from this model are compared with experimental results obtained with an acidic crude oil in a 2” x 140 m multiphase pilot loop under steady state flow conditions.

AB  - This paper will present details of DeepStar funded project CTR11203 related to hydrate deposition mechanisms. As the oil and gas industry moves towards offshore developments in deeper waters, the risk management of plugging pipelines due to hydrate formation increases in difficulty, which may lead to operation/safety hazards. To tackle this challenge, the flow assurance community requires prediction tools to account for hydrate formation in flowlines. Although significant knowledge has been gained from a mechanistic model for hydrate plug formation, there are still components missing for a full comprehensive model such as hydrate deposition on pipeline walls. Currently, field and flowloop data suggest the need to include and quantify hydrate deposition in the hydrate formation model. Agglomeration of hydrate particles by itself cannot account for large pressure drop observed during hydrate formation. Because hydrate deposition is difficult to decouple from other hydrate related phenomena (e.g., agglomeration), little to no research has previously been done addressing this phenomenon, particularly in gas-liquid systems. In this work we present results that provide insight into hydrate deposition mechanisms based on experimental investigations designed to isolate this phenomenon from other hydrate issues. We have identified that water (hydrate former) reaches the deposition surface by diffusion through the hydrocarbon medium, by direct contact of water with the surface, by condensation of water on the cold surface and finally by liquid capillarity. Once the water reaches the deposition surface it forms hydrate deposits. Moreover, we have identified two mechanisms for hydrate deposition, film growth consisting of a hydrate layer growing from a wetted surface and hydrate particle cohesion/adhesion, which occurs when hydrate particles in the liquid bulk adhere to the deposition surface. We have also found that the rate of hydrate deposition increases by decreasing the surface temperature and these results are repeatable. We have shown that hydrate deposition on pipe walls is a key component for hydrate plug formation. The understanding gained with this investigation contributes to the efforts of the flow assurance community to develop a comprehensive hydrate formation model that could account for all the risks pertinent to hydrate formation.

AB  - Gas hydrate plugging is considered a very challenging issue in offshore petroleum production and transportation. The phenomenon of hydrate plug formation involves low temperature and high pressure condition. Hydrates can damage equipment of petroleum transport system. In this study, a computational fluid dynamics (CFD) model is proposed to analyze the effect of hydrate flow in pipelines using ANSYS FLUENT multiphase flow modeling techniques. This study has been carried out with a joint industrial collaboration with GRi simulations, Canada. Two case studies have been investigated. The first one is with a pipeline with a dimension specified by an existing literature (Balakin et al., 2010a) for validating the simulation results. The other one is with a more complex geometry of M-shaped jumper including six elbows. Eulerian-Eulerian method was used to model the multiphase hydrate flow. Moreover, the population balance method (PBM) was used to model the hydrate agglomeration and breaking up mechanism. A parametric study of stress analysis due to the flow-induced vibration on pipelines was also investigated. This study helps to identify the regions where the maximum stress and deformation due to various flow conditions. The overall objective is to integrate the ANSYS FLUENT model with GRi simulation's IDEA-FDK platform. Petroleum industry can effectively use the proposed tool to prevent the risky operating conditions in offshore structures. The results from the analysis will help to identify the cause of the pipeline failure, regions of the maximum stress occurred in the pipeline and the plastic deformation of the pipeline due to hydrate flow in pipeline.

This will widen the technological basis for such projects.In this context Statoil, on behalf of the POSEIDON project, has initiated a research program on the dynamic behaviour of hydrates formed in multi phase flow systems.A large variety of hydrate products were encountered. These ranged from solid hydrates plugging the pipe, to finely dispersed hydrate particles with no tendency to coagulate or deposit. The hydrates formed were classified according to the expected operational trouble potential of each product.The effect of velocity was studied. The tendency to plug the pipeline was found to be dependent upon flow velocity.Different additives for modification of hydrate properties were also studied.1. IntroductionTo develop the concept of multiphase transportation of oil and gas into an established technology, several aspects regarding fluid properties requires close attention.Hydrates in gas pipe lines, has for a long time, been recognized as a source of problems. Numerous studies have been performed to measure the conditions around hydrate formation and to develop models. Most of the studies were performed in static two-phase systems.The behaviour of hydrates in multiphase transportation systems is however, unknown. A research program has therefore been initiated by Statoil to gain knowledge about hydrate behaviour in multiphase transportation system.

AB  - AbstractTwo low dosage gas hydrate inhibitors, antiagglomerant type and a combination antiagglomerant/kinetic polymeric inhibitor have been successfully field tested in a gas producing well. The well located in Canadian foothills posed challenges for the operators. High pressure, low bottomhole temperature and Joule-Thomson gas decompression cooling effect created favorable conditions for gas hydrates at depths below 300 meters. The well would plug-up with hydrates daily in spite of being treated with 400-500 L of methanol. The operator experienced significant monetary losses due to lost production and had to use considerable amounts of chemicals and time to clean-up hydrates from plugged tubings.The inhibitors were applied downhole in 20% to 10% methanol solution. This novel approach allowed utilization of existing solvent storage and pumping equipment so that no capital spending was required when converting the hydrate prevention program from methanol to LDHI treatment.The combination inhibitor was diluted to 20% in methanol in a stock tank and pumped into the well at the approximate rate 30 L/day. Similarly, the antiagglomerant was initially used at 20% solution in methanol and later its concentration was lowered to 10%. The daily inhibitor treatment rate was established at 45 L.Laboratory results indicate the combination product is a better hydrate inhibitor than the antiagglomerant. However, the cost analysis favors the usage of less expensive antiagglomerant in this application.Following the successful treatment of one well, several more similar gas wells throughout the field were identified and converted from methanol hydrate prevention method to antiagglomerant treatment.IntroductionGas hydrates form when water molecules crystallize around guest molecules. The water/guest crystallization process has been recognized for several years, is well characterized and occurs with sufficient combinations of temperature and pressure.1 Light hydrocarbons, methane-to-heptanes, nitrogen, carbon dioxide and hydrogen sulfide are the guest molecules of interest to the natural gas industry. Depending on the pressure and gas composition, gas hydrates may build up at any place where water coexists with natural gas at temperatures as high as 80°F (~30°C). Gas transmission lines and gas wells are particularly vulnerable to being blocked with hydrates.Formation of gas hydrates can be eliminated or hindered by several methods. The thermodynamic prevention methods control or eliminate elements necessary for hydrate formation: the presence of hydrate forming guest molecules, the presence of water, high pressure and low temperature. The elimination of any one of these four factors from a system would preclude the formation of hydrates. Unfortunately, elimination of these hydrate elements is often impractical or even impossible. This is especially true in gas production wells where one has no control over the composition of produced fluids and bottomhole pressure and temperature. The well operator has only limited control over the wellhead pressure. The formation temperature and Joule-Thomson gas cooling effect upon decompression are the factors determining whether the particular well or any part of it is at hydrates conditions. Further downstream, the gas is normally processed to make the stream more resistant to hydrate build-up. The gas conditioning includes sweetening, dehydration and pressure control in transmission lines.There are reported solutions to hydrates problems in production wells. For example Hale, et al.2 patented a method of preventing hydrates formation in such wells with addition of polycyclicpolyether polyols. However, the most prevailing practical approach of preventing gas hydrates formation is the addition of massive amounts of alcohols, glycols or salts to the gas/water stream. These chemicals being thermodynamic hydrate inhibitors shift the operating conditions outside of the hydrate formation region. These additives shift the hydrate equilibrium curve toward higher pressure and lower temperature conditions. They destabilize hydrates and effectively lower the temperature of hydrate formation.

Abstract New data on the initial hydrate formation conditions have been obtained for pure isobutane along the hydrate-water liquid-isobutane liquid locus and for ten mixtures of methane and isobutane covering a concentration range from 0.23 to 63.6 mol percent isobutane along the hydrate-water liquid-vapor locus. In addition the four phase hydrate-water liquid -isobutane liquid - vapor quadruple locus has been determined from pure isobutane liquid and vapor phases. This occurred for a mixture pure isobutane liquid and vapor phases. This occurred for a mixture containing 19.8 percent isobutane at a temperature of 77.8 deg. F and a pressure of 1678 psia. The phase behavior of systems of this type is pressure of 1678 psia. The phase behavior of systems of this type is described in some detail. Introduction Many studies have been made of the hydrate forming conditions for materials commonly found in natural gases or in other industrially important systems. The experimental work of Hammerschmidt, Deaton and Frost, and Katz and his coworkers, provided a foundation on which much of the more recent theoretical work has relied. The pioneering contributions of von Stackelberg and Muller, Claussen, Van der Waals and Platteeu and more recently Parrish and Prausnitz have greatly increased our Platteeu and more recently Parrish and Prausnitz have greatly increased our understanding of the nature of hydrates and have improved our ability to predict the conditions under which they may form. predict the conditions under which they may form. A renewed interest in the phase behavior of hydrate forming systems has developed because of the possibility of hydrate formation in liquified petroleum product pipelines, because of the potential discoveries of frozen gas fields in the Arctic regions, and because of the denuding effect of hydrates on crude oils in permafrost regions.

AB  - McLeod, Wilfred R., Marathon Oil Company AbstractThis paper discusses the more significant advances in hydrate control technology in the past twenty years. It also examines the applicability of these control techniques to the current development of gas reserves, particularly in remote areas. No longer does the old adage, "Move closer to the wellhead!" apply when that haven is submerged in several hundred feet of cold water or located in the high Artic regions and hydrates are to be found in the flow string beneath the wellhead. Control techniques commonly used in these areas comprise variations on long-established practices such as application of heat, lowering practices such as application of heat, lowering system pressure, at least a partial dehydration of gas and/or liquid phases, addition of inhibitors, any purposeful formation of gas hydrates followed by their entrapment, decomposition and discharge of the water phase (known to many as the LTX system). HISTORICAL BACKGROUND: Although Sir Humphrey Davy first reported on hydrates of organic compounds in 1810, it was not until 1934 that Elmer G. Hammerschmidt described natural gas hydrates and their formation in natural gas transmission systems. A growing awareness of this problem led to extensive research on several facets of gas hydrate formation by W. M. Deaton and E. M. Frost Jr. of the USBM prior to World War II. These studies, though nearly complete, were interrupted by wartime activities and the results were not published until 1946 as USBM MONOGRAPH 8. These and other investigations established the nature of hydrate formation in multicomponent mixtures of hydrocarbons and water and the effect of other gases such as H2, CO2, N2 and H2S on hydrate formation by hydrocarbon gases. Methods were developed to calculate the equilibrium conditions of hydrate formation, or in essence to predict the conditions under which hydrate formation predict the conditions under which hydrate formation is likely to occur in any of several pure and multicomponent hydrocarbon gas systems. Hydrate forming conditions for a number of brinary systems containing water and hydrocarbons or CO2 and H2S are shown by the equilibrium curves of Figure 1. Generally, each component has a critical temperature above which no hydrate of this compound is formed. This temperature corresponds to the point of intersection of the equilibrium hydrate-formation curve of the hydrate forming compound. The figure shows H2S with the highest critical temperature. Therefore, natural gas systems containing H2S form hydrates more readily than do gases of the same density without H2S. By 1955, present-day technology had been developed and was in use by the petroleum industry. Several tenets were well-established, such as: A. Essential Conditions for Gas Hydrate Formation 1. Favorable conditions of pressure and temperature of the gas. 2. Presence of a liquid water phase. 3. Thorough agitation between the phases. B. Methods for Preventing Gas Hydrate Formation 1. Heating gas above hydrate formation temperature. 2. Lowering gas pressure on the system. 3. Dehydrate the gas to a level where no condensation occurs. 4. Use of inhibitors to depress hydrate formation temperature. 5. Use of the low-temperature separation process (LTX) which purposely forms hydrates by Joule-Thomson (J-T) expansion separates them from the cold gas, moves them to a warm zone, and there hydrocarbons and water. The latter is discharged from the system. C. Inhibitor Choices 1. Methanol 2. Ethylene Glycol 3. Diethylene Glycol

AB  - AbstractA concept, CONWHYP (CONversion of Water to HYdrate Particles), has been developed in which a recirculation stream containing hydrate particles seeds hydrate growth in a cooled water-containing well stream. The hydrate particles then grow quickly and in a controlled manner. The hydrate particles are dry, non-depositing and non-agglomerating, and will eliminate free water from the rest of the transport system. The concept has been tested and verified in a prototype laboratory setup. The results include general observations of dry hydrate behavior, experiments on water content, hydrate particle morphology, and salt and "black oil" effects. Some possible designs for industrial application of the concept as a subsea-processing unit for multiphase flow solutions in harsh environments are outlined. IntroductionThe trend of oil and gas industry moving into deeper and colder water, together with the minimization of on-site platforms and processing capabilities, means that hydrate problems will be a major factor in many new development projects. Traditionally, hydrate issues have been avoided through the use of chemical inhibitors, leading to a host of associated problems such as demanding lots of extra equipment and space due to huge volumes, logistical challenges, negative environmental impacts, high costs, and sometimes lower product quality. When hydrate problems do occur, they are solved by introducing some of the same chemicals, or by reducing the pressure. Longer and deeper pipelines will make both of these methods more difficult to apply, as chemicals will be harder to get to remote parts, and the hydrostatic pressure alone will keep lower parts of a pipeline inside the hydrate region.The CONWYP project has therefore aimed at developing a technology through which the industry can live with hydrates by controlling their appearance to avoid problems (deposition and plugging), and using the hydrates to minimize other problems, through making water unavailable for e.g. corrosion.The CONWHYP conceptIf hydrates are produced in a controlled manner, dry and "inert" hydrate particles will result. It is in the formation stages, where free, unconverted water still is present, that hydrates have the well-known appearance and properties that may lead to pipeline deposition and plugging (Ref. 1). CONWHYP (CONversion of Water to HYdrate Particles) is a concept developed by SINTEF for conversion of free water to flowable "inert" hydrate particles in a fluid flow. If water is to be transported as a hydrate slurry in a cold pipeline from a subsea field, the water to hydrate reaction has to be driven to total completion such that no more solids will be able to deposit out. i.e. no water is available for further hydrate formation. In order to achieve this, water from a subsea well will have to be converted to hydrates near the well in a fast and controlled manner without any deposition-prone intermediate stages. In the CONWHYP concept this is done without chemical additives by using the fact that hydrate surfaces exhibit a high degree of hydrophilic behaviour (Refs. 2 and 3).

Some theoretical aspects in connection with the thermodynamic andkinetic mechanisms of hydrates formation are reviewed, following which themethods for controlling their generation during drilling, gas production,transportation and processing are mentioned. At the end of the paper thepossibilities for hydrate utilization in connection with natural gas storageare being considered.IntroductionIn the oil production industry gaseous hydrocarbon hydrates represent aspecial problem leading to production losses and implying high costs forcontrolling their formation or for their removal.Lately, a major concern of the research activity in the oil field has beenthe finding of some efficient methods for reducing the risks induced byhydrates. In addition to this some solutions are also sought for hydrateutilization taking into account the high potential of gaseous hydrocarbonstorage.Efficient possibilities for gas drying, thermodynamic inhibition and morerecently for the kinetic inhibition of the hydrate formation are presented. Thepossibility of achieving a technological process for producing cryohydrateswith the view to use them as a substitute of liquefied petroleum gas is alsopresented.Hydrate formation theoryNatural gas hydrates are solid, white, crystalline substances, with cellularstructure (of clathrate type) which are formed as a result of water vapours andgaseous hydrocarbons (or other gases) interaction in the presence of free waterand under conditions of high pressure and low temperature (over 0°Chowever).

AB  - AbstractGas hydrates are metastable minerals whose formation, stable existence and decomposition depend on pressure, temperature and composition of the gas and water.Gas hydrates are widespread in nature; they exist in sedimentary rocks on land in sub-Arctic regions and in the cold sediments of the ocean at depths of 200 m or more. Potential gas resources concentrated on earth in the hydrate state exceed 1.5 × 1 0 16m3. Although gas hydrates can be a tremendous energy source, they can also be an expensive problem during the drilling and operation of deep wells and during the operation of oil and gas pipelines. Analysis of research results indicates that the properties of hydrate and hydrate saturated sediments remains one of the most important and least studies parts of the hydrate problem. The properties of natural gas hydrates depend on the conditions of formation, dynamics of pressure, temperature in the sediments in geological time, migration of gas-saturated water, structure and hydrate saturation of sediments, position of hydrate-saturated stratum in the hydrate formation zone, supercooling d hydrates, and many other factors.Recent research results of the authors into the properties of hydrates are discussed with particular reference to the factors mentioned above.IntroductionDeep drilling and operation of oil and gas wells, and operation of oil and gas pipelines in the deep sea are vastly complicated by the presence of natural gas hydrates.Gas hydrate is a metastable mineral. Its formation, stable existence and decomposition depend on pressure, temperature, and composition of the gas and water.Gas hydrates are inclusion compounds, solid solutions, in which water is the solvent. Molecules of water tied together by hydrogen bonds form a space-filling lattice. Mobile molecules of gasses are absorbed or incorporated in the cavities of the water lattice.Gas hydrates are widespread in nature A in sedimentary rock on land in the sub-Arctic regions and in the cold bottom rock of the ocean at depths of 200-500 m or more. Potential gas resources concentrated on earth in the hydrate state exceed 15x1015m3 . Explored reserves of methane in the hydrate state are over 700 trillion m3. Several countries have started research aimed at the discovery and production of gas from offshore gas hydrate deposits. For example, Japan discovered 12 gas hydrate deposits around the Japan islands with total reserves of methane estimated at 6 trillion m3. A program of testing production of gas from the hydrate deposits will start in 1999 (Okuda, 1996). Similar programs have started in India, where potential resources in the Bay of Bengal can be over 60 trillion m3, and in the Ukraine (Black Sea opposite the Crimea) where potential resources are over 25 trillion m3. The amount throughout the entire Black Sea bottom is about 75-100 trillion m3 (Smirnov, 1996).On one hand, gas hydrate represents a tremendous amount of mineral energy, but on the other hand, a large expensive problem.

Based on estimates for land-based plants, the capital cost of hydrate technology is considerably lower than LNG, methanol and syncrude technologies. Offshore-based hydrate plants are also expected to be lower in costs. Crude/hydrate slurry processes are being developed for use on FPSO's.

AB  - Abstract Deepwater gas field development and/or gas fields’ production in remote locations requires long tiebacks with low temperature and high pressure flow paths and complex seabed topographies. Hydrate formation and plugging is one of the most probable Flow Assurance risks under those conditions, and there is an urgent need for a better knowledge of these gas dominant systems behaviour regarding hydrate plug formation as well as effects of additives (Thermodynamic, Kinetic Hydrate Inhibition (KHI) and Anti-Agglomerant (AA)). Indeed, during the design phase of new field development, oil companies have to choose a hydrate mitigation strategy. To do that, important questions rapidly arise: What about the gas layer protection? How can non-volatile additives act/protect the non-wetted top of the line from condensed water hydrate formation in stratified flow? Is there a need to take/run some specific procedures (such as slug of additives) to avoid hydrate problems? The Additive and Hydrate at the Top of Line (AHToL) JIP phase 1 project's objective was to acquire knowledge and data in multiphase Lyre pilot loop in such gas dominant conditions. The paper presents Lyre loop pilot tests performed with gas dominant systems without additive. The hydrate formation was performed in multiphase flow. The pilot and tests results in stratified flow are shown. Two types of fluids compositions were tested: Gas/Water and Gas/Condensate/Water. The water to hydrate conversion rates are calculated. Photos of hydrate deposits inside the flow loop are shown. The plugging mechanisms identified show a direct correlation with the fluids compositions circulating

AB  - Abstract Quantitative prediction of gas hydrate formation risk is critical for the successful implementation of risk-based approaches to hydrate management in subsea production. Here we use a high pressure, stirred, automated lag-time apparatus and a high pressure acoustic levitator to experimentally obtain smooth probability distributions describing stochastic hydrate formation. Robust, repeatable hydrate nucleation and growth rate probability distributions as a function of induction time and subcooling are measured for various gases, shear rates and inhibitor dosages in systems with interfacial areas ranging from (0.1 to 60) cm2. The results reveal that new engineering models can be used to reliably predict hydrate formation probability. Importantly these new models have solid theoretical foundations which enables them to be generalized with confidence to industrial systems.

AB  - AbstractThis paper presents some results obtained in a Research project managed by IFP (Institut Français du Pétrole) and IFE (Institute for Energy Technology), where the objective is to study the transport of hydrates in production lines.A number of research projects are devoted to the study of thermodynamic equilibrium in the presence of hydrates, and the kinetics of hydrate formation, in order to develop prevention tools like hydrates inhibitors, insulation.... But with the development of deep water and ultra deep water production schemes where these technologies become expensive and some times limited, a fair prediction of hydrate formation and transport conditions becomes necessary for anticipating the design of the production facilities and could help the production engineers to make the appropriate decisions. In the literature, however little efforts have been directed towards the hydrodynamic modeling of hydrate transport. This project aims at the study of hydrate slurries in flowing conditions and particularly in multiphase flow lines.Experimental data in flow loop are presented. Comparisons have been made with flow models. In presence of hydrate crystals, the production fluid resembles a slurry with effective transport properties. This study indicates that the presence of particles in the flow tends to increase the wall drag and, consequently, influences the production capacity of the line. Moreover the settling trends of these solid particles can complicate the problem. Discussions about these issues have been done.IntroductionDeep water and ultra deep-water production developments must face hydrates issues. Indeed, the thermodynamic conditions of existence of hydrate particles in a flow line are low temperature and large pressure (for example 40 bars and 4°C for methane hydrates). These conditions of temperature and pressure become common in deep offshore flowlines.One conventional approach to the hydrate problem is using thermodynamic inhibitors like methanol or glycol. This involves adding a lot of extra liquid to the well flow. Besides implying a logistics problem in supplying large amounts of liquids to an offshore site, the extra liquid increases the gravitational pressure drop due to the weight added by the inhibitor which may reduce the production capacity of the line. The problem is aggravated by the large elevation differences involved in deep offshore fields. Further, with the low temperatures and high pressure often involved, the amount of added thermodynamic inhibitor may be excessive.By using a Low Dosage Additive (LDA) we are not only reducing the amount of added liquid, we are also dispersing the water into the oil and thereby reducing oil/water slip and thereby the water accumulation that may further increase the gravitational pressure drop. These gains must be balanced against any modification of the flow caused by the presence of hydrate crystals, such as increase in flow friction, increase in viscosity/consistency of the hydrate-in-oil slurry.In this study, dispersions of hydrates were formed in a large flow loop and flow characteristics were analyzed.

AB  - Abstract Offshore flowlines transporting hydrocarbons have to be operated very carefully to avoid the formation of gas hydrates as they are considered one of the largest concerns for flow assurance engineers. The oil and gas industry is generally relying on chemical injection for hydrate inhibition; however hydrate blockages can occur in many different places of offshore production system due to unexpected circumstances. Once hydrate blockage formed considerable efforts are required to dissociate the hydrate via depressurization. Because residual hydrate structures known as gas hydrate precursors will be present in the aqueous phase after dissociation, the risk of hydrate re-formation becomes extremely high. Although the KHIs are becoming popular in many fields as hydrate inhibitors are considered not effective to inhibit the hydrate formation in the presence of residual hydrate structures, so that the use of KHIs for shut-in and restart operations is not recommended. In this study, new experimental procedures composed of three stages are designed to simulate the dissociation of hydrate blockages and transportation of well fluids experiencing hydrate formation. The obtained experimental results have shown that gas hydrates are rapidly re-formed when the temperature of dissociated water falls into the hydrate formation region. With an injection of KHIs before transporting the well fluids, the subcooling increased significantly indicating the possible use of KHIs for transporting the well fluids after dissociation of hydrate blockage. Moreover, the inhibition performance of KHIs is also investigated with two different gases to study the effect of gas composition. This study is confirmed that KHIs are possible candidate to prevent the hydrate re-formation in well fluids experiencing hydrate formation if the KHI is carefully evaluated.   Introduction Gas hydrates are nonstoichiometric crystalline compounds that are classified into three structural families of cubic structure I, cubic structure II, and hexagonal structure H. Offshore flowlines transporting hydrocarbons have to be operated very carefully to avoid the formation of gas hydrates as they are considered the largest concern for flow assurance engineers. For many years industrial practice to prevent hydrate-related risks is the injection of thermodynamic hydrate inhibitors (THI) at the wellhead, commonly methanol or monoethylene glycol (MEG), to shift the hydrate equilibrium curve toward higher pressure and lower temperature, so that the operating condition of offshore flowlines are outside of the hydrate formation condition. However as the search for hydrocarbon resources moves into deeper and colder waters further offshore, these conventional techniques are becoming uneconomic due to higher injection rate of inhibitors and accompanying operational issues such as logistics and storage requirement. Although the MEG injection is considered to be the standard method for the offshore gas production system, Kinetic Hydrate Inhibitor (KHI) is also becoming popular as its dosage rate is expected in the range of 0.5~3.0 wt%, which is much lower than MEG's 30~60 wt%. Kinetic hydrate inhibitors (KHIs) are water-soluble polymers and delay the formation of hydrate crystals. These include homo- and co-polymers of the N-vinyl pyrrolidone (PVP) and N-vinyl caprolactam (PVCap). The KHIs available to date are only effective in subcoolings up to 14 oC and their performance can be affected by the presence of other chemicals such as corrosion inhibitors.  There have been attempts to develop a KHI evaluation method based on a hydrate precursor where the hydrate-forming gas was a binary mixture of methane and propane that forms structure II. In this work, we conduct experiments to investigate hydrate formation in the presence of hydrate precursors and the effects of KHI on the inhibition of hydrate re-formation simulating the cold start-up after remediation of hydratep plug.

AB  - Abstract The current industry practice for hydrate prevention is injecting hydrate inhibitors at the upstream end of pipelines based on the calculated/measured hydrate phase boundary, water cut, worst pressure and temperature conditions, and the amount of inhibitor lost to non-aqueous phases. In general, systematic ways of controlling and monitoring along the pipeline and/or downstream to examine the degree of inhibition are very limited.It is also known that hydrate formation would result in some changes in the aqueous phase. Therefore, it should be possible to detect initial hydrate formation by detecting these changes. The focus of our work is to develop a warning system against initial hydrate formation either by detecting minute hydrate particles and/or any changes in the water structure. The aim is to give the operator adequate time to initiate remedial steps prior to massive hydrate formation/build up which could result in pipeline blockage.In this paper, we present a new approach for hydrate monitoring and warning system using physical property measurements such as dielectric properties and ultrasonic wave signal. The results demonstrate that dielectric properties at microwave frequencies has potential to be used as a downstream analysis and online analysis for detecting the initial hydrate formation and/or presence of hydrate particles and/or change in water structure due to hydrate formation. The ultrasonic signals (e.g., FFT and amplitude) could detect the presence of minute hydrate crystals and even nuclei, while there is no sign of hydrate formation from monitoring system pressure. The results are very encouraging and could potentially change the industrial approach to gas hydrate control strategy. This work is part of a comprehensive project which covers monitoring the degree of inhibition against hydrate formation to further improve the safety of offshore/deepwater operations, as well as optimizing inhibitor injection rate to minimize their environmental impact and improve the economical aspects of the development. Some of the methods developed in this work are equally applicable to reducing the risks associated with wax and/or salt depositions, further improving the flow assurance aspects of deepwater developments.Introduction Gas hydrates are ice like crystalline solid compound formed from the mixture of water and suitable sized gas molecules, which trap inside the cage. The water molecule is called the host and gas is the guest molecule. Under suitable condition, typically at high pressure and low temperature, the water molecules form unstable crystalline lattice structure through hydrogen bonding with cavities. The gas molecules occupy these cavities and a solid gas hydrate formed. There are three known type of hydrate crystal structure. Structure I, structure II and structure H, which was described in detail by Sloan [1,2].These structures are formed by different combinations of crystalline cavities, with different sizes depending on guest molecules.Gas hydrate can form naturally on Earth or as a result of man-made conditions. Naturally occurring gas hydrate in sediments (permafrost regions and subsea sediments) can be a potential natural gas resource. Natural gas hydrates offer a largely unexploited means of energy recovery and transportation and they could play a significant role in past and future climate changes [1].Oil industry is facing with flow assurance issue on hydrate deposits in pipelines where hydrate often forms at inaccessible locations. One of the problems other than blockage is the movement of the hydrate plugs in the pipeline at high velocity can cause rupture in the pipeline. Any blockage in an oil/gas pipeline due to hydrate is a serious threat to the economic and cost effective strategy and also personel safety.

AB  - Summary This paper experimentally analyzes the production characteristics of hot-brine stimulation accompanying hydrate reformation in the presence of methane hydrate. Many attempts have been made to recover methane hydrate commercially, such as depressurization, thermal stimulation, and inhibitor injection. Hot-brine injection coupled with thermal recovery with inhibitor injection has been investigated as an efficient production scheme, but the hydrate reformation during the dissociation is problematic, and it negatively influences the recovery rate. An experimental apparatus divided the sediment sample into 12 blocks not only to describe 1D dissociation effectively but also to control the temperature accurately. The specified amount of methane hydrate was formed artificially in unconsolidated and packed sediments where the average particle size, absolute permeability, and porosity were 260 µm, 4.4 darcies, and 42%, respectively. The production trends were observed in the temperature range of approximately 283.85 - 303.15 K and with injection rates of 10 and 15 cm3/min. Methane hydrate reformed in all the tests; the reason for this may be the recombination of water and the dissociated methane in the downstream zones. In the early time, the production rate was low, but it increased significantly in later time. The former was why most of gas that dissociated in the upstream zones was consumed to reform hydrate in the downstream areas, while the latter came from the dissociation of initial and reformed hydrate. The dissociation front moved fast at the higher temperature and injection rate. The production efficiency of the test at 15 cm3/min and 294.55 K was similar to that of the test at 10 cm3/min and 303.15 K. The results confirmed the production behaviour of methane hydrate under the reformation phenomenon and could provide the fundamentals to develop an efficient production scheme based on hot-brine stimulation.

AB  - Abstract Methane hydrate was formed in moist sand under a confining stress in a long, x-ray transparent pressure vessel. Three initial water saturations were used to form three different methane hydrate saturations. X-ray computed tomography (CT) was used to observe location-specific density changes caused by hydrate formation and flowing water. Gas permeability was measured in each test for the dry sand, moist sand, frozen sand, and hydrate-bearing sand, and results of these measurements are presented. Water was flowed through the hydrate-bearing sand, and the changes in water saturation were observed using CT scanning. Inverse modeling will be performed using these data to extend the relative permeability measurements. 1.0 Introduction Gas hydrate-bearing deposits present in the permafrost and in suboceanic environments have been identified as potential sources of natural gas. The production of natural gas from hydrates will pose many challenges, among which is the economic viability of producing gas from a particular resource. This interest in gas hydrates has induced many laboratory studies focused on various aspects of gas hydrates in the natural environment. Pristine samples of natural gas hydrates have been difficult to retrieve and make measurements on because the hydrates are not stable at atmospheric conditions and require cold temperatures or high gas pressures to stabilize them. Pressure coring has been successfully performed, retrieving the most representative samples so far, however, these are not readily available for all studies, or in some cases not amenable to the needed study. Several techniques are used to make gas hydrates for laboratory study. In the ice-to-hydrate method (Stern et al., 1996), ice is contacted with methane at the appropriate pressure, and then melted resulting hydrate forming. The hydrate can then be pulverized and mixed with a mineral substrate and compacted. In the excess gas method (Handa and Stupin, 1992), water is distributed throughout a mineral substrate (ie. sand or silica gel) and the mixture is brought to hydrate-stable conditions causing hydrate to form. In the dissolved gas method (Tohidi et al., 2001), water containing sufficient dissolved guest molecules is brought to hydrate-stable conditions and hydrate forms. Permeability (the resistance to fluid flow under a pressure gradient) and relative permeability (the effect of the presence of other phases such as gas hydrate that interfere with the flow of the fluid of interest) are among the most important parameters governing gas production from a hydrate-bearing reservoir. From the gas production perspective, a large gas hydrate reserve with low permeability can be less desirable than a smaller reserve with higher permeability. Understanding the effects of the presence of gas hydrate in the porespace on permeability and water and gas relative permeability is necessary to more accurately predict natural gas production and economic viability from hydrate-bearing reservoirs.

AB  - Abstract Since their initial discovery in the 1960’s, gas hydrates have been considered to be an important potential source of unconventional natural gas. Significant progress has been made relative to our understanding of the geologic and engineering controls on the ultimate energy potential of gas hydrate; however, more work is required to realize the promise of gas hydrates as a future energy source. Gas hydrates have been encountered, recovered or inferred to exist in numerous sedimentary basins in Arctic permafrost settings, regions of alpine permafrost, marine sediments of outer continental margins and in deep lakes. Despite the great abundance of potential gas hydrate resources in the world, a large portion of these resources reside in clay-rich sediments and fracture dominated reservoir systems, and are not generally considered producible with existing technology, but may have future potential with the emergence of new technologies. For a large portion of the world, gas hydrate in sand reservoirs have become a viable production target and the focus of the first production testing efforts. Production tests in Arctic Canada (Mackenzie Delta) and Alaska have shown that gas can be produced from highly-concentrated gas hydrate accumulations in coarse-grained (i.e., sand rich) reservoir systems with conventional production technologies. Production can be achieved through the depressurization method and by more complex methods such as molecular substitution (e.g., CO2-CH4 exchange). In 2013, the gas hydrate production test was conducted in a marine setting in the offshore of Japan. An additional test was conducted in Japan in 2017 to further evaluate alternative well completion technologies. Also in 2018, China initiated a 60-day gas hydrate production test in the Shenhu region of the South China Sea. This report reviews the results of gas hydrate engineering and production testing studies associated with the Mallik, Mount Elbert, and Iġnik Sikumi projects in northern Canada and Alaska. The results of the marine gas hydrate producing testing efforts in the Nankai Trough (Japan) and in the South China Sea (China) are also summarized.

AB  - AbstractIn order to give an optimal design of methane hydrate inhibitors for deep-sea drilling, the most popular thermodynamic hydrate inhibitors (THIs) including NaCl and glycol, kinetic hydrate inhibitors (KHIs) including poly (vinyl pyrrolidone) and poly (vinylcaprolactam), and the mixtures of these inhibitors were experimentally tested in drilling fluid under the seabed conditions at different water depths. Moreover, a high performance KHI was developed and was proved to be a better one than the typical KHIs. Based on the performance tests and compatibility tests, the optimal hydrate inhibitors were designed for drilling deep-sea wells located at different water depth.

AB  - Abstract As the oil and gas industry moves towards offshore developments in deeper waters, the risk management of plugging pipelines due to hydrate formation increases in difficulty, which may lead to operation/safety hazards (Sloan, 2005). To tackle this challenge, the flow assurance community requires predictive tools to account for hydrate formation in flowlines (Zerpaet al., 2011). Although significant knowledge has been gained from mechanistic models for hydrate plug formation, there are still components missing for a comprehensive model, such as hydrate deposition on pipeline walls. Currently, field and flowloop data suggest the need to include and quantify hydrate deposition in the hydrate formation model (Lachanceet al., 2012). Agglomeration of hydrate particles by itself cannot account for large pressure drop observed during hydrate formation. Because hydrate deposition is difficult to decouple from other hydrate related phenomena (e.g., agglomeration), little to no research has previously been done addressing this phenomenon, particularly in gas-liquid systems. This paper details the initial effort to study hydrate deposition mechanism as part of a DeepStar funded project (CTR11203). Here, we present results that provide insight into hydrate deposition mechanisms based on experimental investigations designed to isolate this phenomenon from other hydrate issues. We have identified that water (hydrate former) reaches the deposition surface by direct contact of water with the surface, by condensation of water on the cold surface, and finally by liquid capillarity. Once the water reaches the deposition surface hydrate deposits form. We have also found that the rate of hydrate deposition increases by decreasing the surface temperature and these results are repeatable. We have shown that hydrate deposition on pipe walls is a key component for hydrate plug formation. The understanding gained with this investigation contributes to the efforts of the flow assurance community to develop a comprehensive hydrate formation model that could account for all the risks pertinent to hydrate formation in multiphase flow systems.

AB  - ABSTRACT:The methane hydrate is considered as an encouraging new energy resource because of its huge amount of reserves. Especially, it would be available under the ocean floors in the Pacific Ocean around Japan Islands. However, the reckless mining development might cause serious disasters such as sliding or mass movement of seabed. To prevent such disasters due to the methane hydrate mining development, it is necessary to understand its mechanical properties from the geotechnical viewpoint. In this paper, the relationship between compressive strength and density of methane hydrate is discussed. Based on the triaxial compression test results under low temperature and high pressure, static shear behaviors of methane hydrate and ice are compared. Compressive strength of methane hydrate increases as decreasing temperature or increasing pressure and it also increases as increasing density of methane hydrate specimen. Compressive strength of ice also increases as decreasing temperature or increasing pressure at low density, however, it rarely increases at high density. Through the above discussion, the void condition of methane hydrate is supposed to be different from that of ice at the same density. INTRODUCTIONMethane hydrate is a crystal of ice and methane molecules are taken in a cage encaged in a called cluster structure that water molecules construct under low temperature and high pressure. In recent years, it is being considered as an encouraging new energy resource to replace oil and natural gas, because of such the huge amounts of reserves as are estimated that it is to be sufficient to last over 100 years based on present levels of natural gas consumption. Especially, it would be found at the edge of the tectonic plates around Japanese Islands under the ocean floors in the Pacific Ocean (Matsumoto et al., 1993). Methane hydrate is stable under low temperature and high pressure.

AB  - Abstract An axisymmetric numerical model that investigates casing and formation integrity in gas hydrate bearing sediments has been created using FLAC3D. The model simulates a vertical wellbore drilled in cemented sandy sediments. The middle layer of sediments can be cemented with an appreciable amount of gas hydrate entrapped in the pore space. The other two layers are cemented with a stable non hydrate material.It is found that the maximum von Mises stresses occur at the top of the casing. Heating the casing causes the von Mises stresses of the casing to increase along the casing profile but not at the top of the casing. The design of a string of casing is based on the minimum safety factor which corresponds to the maximum von Mises stress value calculated at the top of the casing. There has been no appreciable difference noted in the von Mises stress response of the casing whether or not the sediments contained hydrates. Additional compressive hoop stresses are generated in the casing as heating continues and the pore pressure increases in the formation due to fluid expansion and hydrate dissociation. These stresses are larger when the casing is placed through a hydrate bearing layer. Nevertheless the absolute maximum thrust in the casing drops upon heating the casing and the wellbore. This maximum thrust occurs at the top of the casing for all the cases studied and is detected close to the base of the hydrates layer in case of its presence after 4 days of heating. No risk of hydrostatic buckling is found.1. INTRODUCTIONCasing integrity has been reported to be affected by a variety of processes, the most common of which is overstressing and deformation resulting from reservoir compaction and surface subsidence during primary production stage, e.g. [1, 2, 3]. Heavy demand and soaring oil and gas prices have recently spurred the petroleum industry to invade new, deep water territories. This move has brought about many challenges, including exploration into hydrate bearing sediments (HBS), which can potentially suffer significant strength deterioration due to heating of the casing. This process may eventually endanger the structural integrity of the well casing, with subsequent economic and environmental impact.Gas hydrates, or clathrates, are ice-like deposits containing a mixture of water and gas, the most common gas being methane. Other gases of small molecular size such as CO2, H2S, ethane and higher hydrocarbons are also found in natural gas hydrates. Gas hydrates are stable under high pressure and low temperature conditions, and hence they can be found in deepwater settings at relatively shallow depths below the seafloor and in permafrost regions [4]. The dissociation of gas hydrates can take place due to a reduction in pressure, an increase in temperature, or the injection of certain chemicals that may affect hydrate stability. Once the hydrates melt due to the circulation of hot fluid in the casing, hydrate bearing sediments will suffer degradation in their mechanical properties (e.g., strength and stiffness), accompanied by changes in the state of stresses.
