AB  - Abstract Drilling experience and well data acquired during field exploration and development can be used to characterize the geomechanical properties of faults and its implications on risk assessment. We have built a geomechanical model based on the available logging and drilling data, along with failure observations from different offset wells. Modeling results have revealed a present-day stress field characterized by a transitional normal faulting to strike-slip stress regime. The large, seismically resolvable faults have been brought into a three-dimensional numerical geomechanical model to determine the stress conditions near these faults. The stress tensor is here combined with a failure criterion to assess the potential for fault instability. Drilling through some of these faults is required to reach the main field targets. We have investigated the effective stresses acting on each fault surface in order to determine whether these faults are active under the current stress field. To understand the risk of losses while drilling, we have estimated the required downhole mud weight pressure to induce shear failure along the main fault surfaces. None of the faults considered in this study are active; however, drilling through these structures may reactivate some fault segments. MWD data has been successfully used to validate the model and highlight the importance of fault stability assessment to help control bottom hole pressures and mitigate the risk of losses while drilling. Introduction Predictive modeling of fault stability represents an integral part of oil field geomechanics, not only from a field production perspective; but also from a drilling standpoint. These are two critical aspects in which fault stability plays an important role not always considered when planning a field development. A large corpus of data has been published on fault seal assessment from a production/exploration perspective (e.g., Finkbeiner et al., 1997; Castillo et al., 2000; Wirprut and Zoback, 2000; Langhi et al., 2010); however, few studies discuss fault stability as a pontential risk while drilling. Faults and fractures are stress sensitive structures which can mechanically respond (shear slip) to changes in the stress field in the form of shear failure or fracture closure. Shear failure along faults can increase fault permeability and compromise the integrity of fault-bounded reservoirs. Changes in reservoir pressures and the subsequent changes in stresses have direct impact on the stability of nearby faults. In this sense, fault stability studies are usually focus on the effects of either injection or depletion at reservoir levels, however, problems may come during the early stages of drilling. It is a common thought that losses take place when the fracture gradient is exceeded due to the hydraulic fracturing of the formation. However, this is not the only source of losses, and in many cases secondary porosity (faults/fractures) and high bottom hole pressures (BHP) are the reason for dynamic losses. In fault-bounded reservoirs it is a common practice to drill through some of the main faults to reach the target. If these faults are optimally oriented they could potentially be reactivated at a lower mud weight than the least principal stress and the upper bound of the operating mud window could be lowered (i.e. optimally oriented faults could be reactivated before achieving the least principal stress or fracture gradient). From a drilling perspective, a fault stability analysis can provide the maximum allowable bottom hole pressure not to exceed while drilling so that fault reactivation does not occur. Fault stability analyses require a precise knowledge of fault geometries, fluid pore pressures and in-situ stress magnitudes and orientations. Drilling experience and data acquired during field exploration and development campaigns are powerful sources of information that can be used to characterize the geomechanical properties of fault zones and its implications on risk assessment.

AB  - Summary 4-D technology is moving into an accelerated phase with several successful projects to date. Acquisition and processing imprints are considered negligible with standard 3-D processing but become critical when computing time-lapse seismic differences. We introduce a spatial co-filtering geostatistical technique into the 4-D processing sequence to remove acquisition imprints and other uncorrelated noise that increases the repeatability and optimises the 4-D signature. Examples from two fields from the North-Sea, Draugen (Norske Shell) and Forties (BP) are presented.IntroductionDuring the past few years, numerous techniques have been developed to tackle the processing of time-lapse seismic (Harris-1998). Nevertheless, 4-D signatures often exhibit residual energy that is not explicitly linked to production effects. These artefacts, like acquisition or processing imprints, are spatially correlated and therefore require the use of spatial filtering.

AB  - ABSTRACT:Accidents occurring in offshore installations may have severe consequences in terms of economic drawbacks, life losses and environmental damages. In fact, hazards due to process and substances handled are increased by specific features of the offshore structures (space limitations, congestion, work-over operations, etc.). Current paper focuses on design strategies to limit hazards and improve the efficiency of the safety barriers which are adopted to reduce risks to acceptable levels. A systematic method for analysis and optimization of the safety performance of the system is proposed. The method developed allows the identification of the safety barrier configurations that maximize the application of inherently safer approaches. The method is based on a staged Layer Of Protection Analysis (LOPA), where the barriers are assessed progressively according to the level in the hierarchy of risk reduction strategies. Cost allocation among barriers is taken into account as well, during each stage, with the final goal of a more reliable and more economical realization of the barriers. Critical components in the barrier system are identified by appropriate inherent safety indicators. This provides the basic support for design choices aimed at the improvement of the safety barriers at each strategy level. The methodology is demonstrated by the application to a case study in an up-stream off-shore installatio

AB  - Abstract Degradations or interruptions of the original well barrier elements might occur at offshore wells after some time in operation. Experience from the Norwegian Continental Shelf has shown that these problems are not always treated as thoroughly as expected by the parties involved. This paper presents an approach for an efficient visualization and description of interrupted well barriers, basically to increase the well barrier control and management. By mapping the history of operational demands and load picture of the well in combination with the status of well barriers, a consistent basis for evaluations is obtained. The main intention is thus to realize the real well problem and its underlying causes in a controlled and systematic manner. Then, the responsible parties involved can take action more accurately according to the type of failure that has been revealed. Introduction Interrupted barrier elements are related to well integrity and are critical from the point of view of safety, but also concerning production regularity and costs. Failure in the well barrier functions caused by degradations or interruptions of barrier elements needs immediate attention from the responsible bodies. During drilling and well activities there are always to be at least two independent and tested well barriers after the surface casing is in place according to the Activities Regulations of the Norwegian Petroleum Safety Authority (PSA) [1]. Experience from (PSA) [2] has shown that barrier failures occur both in newly drilled wells, and in wells that have been in operation for some time. Well integrity failures may be latent in the early constructing phase, or imposed through later maintenance tasks. Shifting between well operational phases can also initiate abnormal load situations causing well integrity failures to occur. Many of these "unexpected?? loads are not necessarily taken into account in the design phase. An investigation carried out by the PSA on the Norwegian Continental Shelf showed that 14 % of 309 checked wells currently in operation had problems with, or deviations related to the well integrity [2]. Experience has also shown that integrity problems are not always treated as systematically and thoroughly as expected by the well operators. The main objective of this paper is to present a visualization methodology for the purpose of evaluating well integrity problems that communicates facts about integrity problems to the responsible bodies. Intended users of the approach are operators, contractors, the authorities, researchers and consultants who have interest in carrying out assessments of well integrity matters. As one possible application, the options regarding future operation of wells may be clarified by the operator, with new preconditions and operational limitations. A brief introduction to the technical problem area is given from a system perspective. Important casing hanger loads are described including those operational and geological factors that make the casing hanger load reaching abnormal values. Then a description of the three-step visualization methodology follows. Implications of the methodology are discussed and some remarks regarding applications are given. Finally, some conclusions are outlined. Problem description Well integrity problems need attention and systematic handling both from the operator's and from the safety authority's point of view. In this focused work the parties involved need appropriate tools to communicate and document the problem, both for the purposes of incident investigation, and for the planning and follow up of future well operations.

AB  - AbstractThe traditional external power source for operating valves associated with offshore Christmas trees and flow lines in oil and gas production has been compressed air or hydraulic fluid. These fluid power supplies and valve actuators have been relied upon to provide the ability to move valves to predetermined safe positions during unusual occurrences or process conditions. As fluid power systems are often complex, requiring frequent inspection and high maintenance, end users and operators of production facilities have long sought a reliable alternative. Efforts to reduce capital expenditures (CAPEX) and operating expenditures (OPEX) coupled with problems associated with hydraulic systems operating in deep water are motivating oil and gas companies to seek alternatives. Electrically powered valve actuators have been used successfully in the North Sea and elsewhere on applications such as mud systems, production test facilities, manifolds and other general applications. However, critical service valves requiring a fail action to a safe open or closed position have historically remained fluid powered. Recent fail-safe electric valve actuator design advances for both topside and subsea applications will provide opportunities to satisfy reliability and economic concerns as well as capitalize on advances in integration with modern digital control systems.IntroductionGate valves typically used on wellhead completion equipment or Christmas trees are operated by applying a linear thrust to the valve stem. Commonly automated valves include master valves, wing valves, injection valves and annulus valves, master valves may require wire cutting capability. Some flow line and manifold applications use ball valves, which require a 90-degree rotary input. Hydraulically powered, spring fail-safe actuators have historically been utilized to operate these valves. While the energy required to fail valves to safe positions is sometimes stored in receiver vessels or accumulators, more often, compressed springs are utilized. Hydraulic fluid under pressure exerts force on a piston, which compresses a spring. With this arrangement, the force of the spring is utilized to operate the valve without the need for any external power source. Electric valve actuators have not traditionally been able to fail a valve to a safe position without external power input, requiring an un-interruptible power source. Nor has there been a satisfactory electric motor and spring combination design, which met the safety and reliability demands of the industry. Recent advances in electric valve actuator design which incorporate an internal spring to provide the energy required to move a valve to a safe position will challenge some of the existing traditions of valve control in oil and gas production. Additionally, enclosure sealing issues have been addressed such that an electric alternative will be available for subsea service in deep water.Technical and Economic FactorsLaws of economics dictate lower cost, shallow water hydrocarbon prospects are the first to be produced. The remaining known undeveloped major offshore oil and gas discoveries are m deep water. Producing these fields presents enormous technological and economic challenges. Using theGulf of Mexico as an example, the ideal subsea design would allow a 60-nule offset from the production platform and 6000foot depth. These parameters would allow floating production to service deepwater GOM discoveries. These extreme distances and depths present problems for traditional hydraulic solutions.

AB  - Summary Addax Petroleum's operated Okwori oil field, offshore Nigeria, illustrated the benefits of reviving shelved projects, because of an insufficient return on investment using more traditional approaches, by applying more recent technical and contractual solutions. The Okwori project demonstrated the feasibility of developing small and geologically complex offshore oil fields in medium water depth of 440 ft with subsea technologies traditionally used for large fields. In the subsurface, the Okwori wells combined multiple selective completions hydraulically controlled from the surface with expandable sand screens as the downhole sand exclusion solution. This combination of equipment in subsea wells used to fully develop a small offshore oil field marked another technological first in Nigeria. Far away from pre-existing facilities and with less than 50 million bbl of median technical reserves at the time of project sanction, the Okwori oilfield development went a step further than the more usual subsea tieback to a pre-existing offshore production facility. The Okwori development plan was based on horizontal subsea trees flowing to a leased spread-moored floating production storage and offloading (FPSO) vessel by means of (6-in.) flexible subsea flowlines and risers. The Okwori leased production facilities had a built-in capability for additional tiebacks such as the Nda oil field, whose development was completed in October 2006, or for later redeployment in other parts of the acreage depending on further exploration and appraisal drilling. A review of the field operations to date highlighted a steep learning curve in the formulation of completion design, completion fluids, stimulation, downhole sand exclusion systems, and bean-up/bean-down procedures. Introduction The Okwori oil field (OML 126) was discovered offshore Nigeria in 1972, approximately 50 miles southwest of the city of Port Harcourt (Fig. 1). Despite a prolific initial well test, subsequent field appraisal revealed a complicated geological structure and fluid distribution with fragmented hydrocarbon pools of limited extension. The Okwori field therefore remained dormant until Addax Petroleum Exploration (Nigeria) Ltd. acquired the asset in 1998 and provided a development plan. Okwori field development drilling started in July 2004 after drilling ND-1, the Nda oilfield discovery well located due west of Okwori. Okwori first oil was delivered in March 2005 as planned. Subsurface Critical Success Factors In the subsurface, Okwori's main challenge was the large number of reservoir layers and fault-delimited compartments resulting in numerous potentially hydrocarbon-bearing pools. More than 100 of those pools were mapped from two vintages of 3D seismic surveys; before field development, six wells appraised 30 such pools (Fig. 2). The Okwori structure resulted from a collapsed crest anticline with two intersecting sets of syn- and post-sedimentary fault planes (Fig. 3). It was noted that seismic imaging was of poor quality owing to the convergence of multiple faults in the core of the collapsed crest and the presence of shallow gas accumulations. Appraisal well trajectories were designed to scoop reservoir closures against fault planes. Hydrocarbon content (oil or gas) and fluid contacts differed between compartments of the same reservoir level, adding another level of complexity to the development. Risked oil-in-place volumes were computed to rank reservoir targets and guide the field development. Each development well was considered as an appraisal well for which the decision to complete any reservoir level would be taken after drilling and logging the well. It was also clear that the size of these hydrocarbon pools would seldom justify more than a single producer per pool. Nigeria petroleum law specified a minimum distance of 800 m between two drainage points in the same hydrocarbon pool, which in Okwori meant only a single possible completion per pool. Pressure maintenance through water or gas injection would require additional wells, a situation neither financially attractive nor technically desirable because of the small dimensions and compartmentalization of the oil rims. Finally, the Okwori reservoirs were made of unconsolidated sandstones from the Niger Delta that required some form of sand control.

AB  - SummaryThis paper highlights the major subsea/subsurface systems and equipment installed over the past several years in the Argyll area fields that have resulted in extended field life. Three. major innovations emphasize the design philosophy of minimizing cost while maximizing flexibility, reliability, and the-use of simple, existing technology. Details include the pioneering installation of gas lift, waterflooding of the Duncan field with its unique manifold system, and remote tie-in of wells 9 miles [14 km] away with a simple hydraulic system.IntroductionThe subsea systems developed for Argyll have been critical to the success of the Argyll area fields. The equipment installed has enabled three oil fields of different production requirements to be. produced safely, reliably, and cost-effectively. The wisdom of designing with a "keep-it-simple" philosophy and the use of off-the-shelf, proven technology has been validated by more than 14 years of operating experience. No other field in the North Sea has been designed with what is now considered old-fashioned, "plain Jane," obsolete equipment, and no other field has been developed nearly as cost-effectively. Few others have been developed as reliably.This paper summarizes the subsea hardware and overall design for the subsea production facilities. The design philosophy is founded on the use of proven technology and the simplest mechanical hookup necessary to produce safely within regulatory requirements.Design EnvironmentThe challenges faced by the engineers on the original Argyll development in the early 1970's are not altogether different from those today. Risk was foremost in their mind: reservoir uncertainties, economic changes, and engineering unknowns. Reservoir engineering has undergone major advances over the years, but fields are still full of surprises, both positive and negative. The magnitude of economic uncertainty then was probably as great as, if not greater than, now. The facility design had to be flexible to allow for potential changes. The size of the Argyll reservoir was judged to be small, about 10 million bbl [1.6×106 m3], and the field life was estimated at 5 years. The price of oil was $9/bbl [$57/m3] in 1974. It took 25 bbl [4 m3] of oil to pay back a capital cost of ; today it takes only 10 bbl [1.6 m3]. The pressure to control costs was as intense then as in today's economic environment.Probably the most significant factor facing the Argyll designers was that, in the early 1970's, facilities to produce a field by subsea methods had never been developed. The Argyll area was the pioneer subsea development. Some field parameters facilitated the selection of a subsea system, but others presented serious potential problems. Reservoir fluid characteristics were dose to ideal. The original crude was sweet, 38°API [0.83 g/cm3]; the flowing pressures and GOR were low; and no problems had been experienced with wax, hydrates, or sand. Areal extent was such that, even at the shallowest reservoir depth of 8,400 ft [2560 m],either directional wells could be planned or straight holes drilled and tied back to the production facility with flowlines.The engineering environment was challenging for that time, however. The engineers could not build on experience from other fields. Weather conditions in the central area of the North Sea are severe and made planning the world's first subsea development difficult. Saturation diving, allowing divers to spend long periods of time at a water depth of 250 ft [76 m], was just becoming widespread in the early 1970's. Semisubmersible drilling rigs were common, however, and much of the subsea technology was based on marine equipment that had been developed for drilling in the North Sea. Use of tried and proven technology was emphasized.Subsea LayoutFig. 1 shows the subsea layout that currently produces the Argyll, Duncan, and Innes fields. The Argyll area has undergone considerable expansion of subsea facilities over the past 14 years of operation, Although some of the original equipment is still in use today, a history of the major changes (outlined later) illustrates that, with time, experience led to some modifications in equipment. The original design on Argyll allowed considerable flexibility . Because of this foresight, two other fields could be tied into the Argyll facilities with only minimum incremental investment. Present production for the complex is 12,000 BOPD [1900 m3/d oil] at a maximum rate of 42,000 BOPD [6680 m3/d oil]. The yearly uptime for the entire system, including the loading buoy, on a well-hour basis was 88% in 1987 and 84% in 1988.

AB  - AbstractPetrobras has utilized different types of units in Marlim Field development. From converted Semi-Submersibles to turret-equipped FPSOs, many different options were made.This paper describes the main reasons for choosing the different types of production units, the conversion approach, and the process plant automation and control system - showing the evolution from one unit to another.The paper also presents the actual performance of each production unit, analyzing the operational results- opex- the main causes of production losses and the efficiency levels reached by the wells and also the process plants.Finally, the paper shows a host of new technologies applied in this development and describes the future units that are on their way to Marlim Field. IntroductionThe use of pilot systems and step by step development is a default procedure at Petrobras. By these means future problems or adjustments in the development plans are foreseen and theirs solutions can be provided for the next step.For the development of the Marlin field, this modular conception was adopted, utilizing subsea completions and floating production systems, and five modules were planned in addition to a pre-pilot and a pilot system. The Marlim field is located at the Northeast of Campos Basin, approximately 105 km from shore with water depths varying from 650 to 1050 meters. The field was discovered in February 1985 by the wildcat 1-RJS-219. Its approximate area is 132 km2. Estimated recoverable reserves are 1.504,3 Mm3 of 19.5° API oil and 18.3 GNm3 of associated gas. The well's water depth varies from 700 to 1050 meters, with flow lines length up to 19 km. Water injection and gas lift is required to improve the field recovery and wax removal operation is a must due to oil characteristics and low water temperature at sea bed. Until December 1998 the Marlim Field has shown an accumulated production of 36.9 Mm3 of oil and 3.1 billion Nm3 of gas. The average daily production in December 1998 was 49827 m3 /d Choice of the Units and conversion approachThe experience with floating production systems, associated with the technology developed by PROCAP ( Deep Water Capability Program) and PROCAP-2000 (Technological Innovation Program on Deepwater Exploitation Systems) led Petrobras to use floating production systems for the development of Marlim field.The Pre-Pilot and Pilot systems were set offside the field at shallower water depths in order to avoid further interferences with the main development.For this purpose, semi-submersible units were chosen, due to its flexibility. The Petrobras 13, priory a drilling unit operating in Campos Basin, was adapted for a long-term production test and became the pre-pilot unit. Its oil production came on stream on Mars 1991. The oil was exported to a tanker on a monobuoy and the gas was burned. In that time Petrobras had purchased some floating units available in the market. One of these units, specifically the Fortune Ugland, a former flotel, was converted into a floating production system and became the pilot system of the Marlim field. The unit was renamed as Petrobras 20 and its production came on stream on July 1992. The oil production is exported through a monobuoy system to tankers and the gas production send to shore through pipelines.

AB  - Abstract Floating Production Storage and Offloading facilities (FPSO) and deep offshore projects are demanding and very sizeable investments that have to be optimized and protected. The design and operation of FPSO's face technical challenges that require numerous and detailed process, control, safety and flow assurance simulations to secure investments and maximize production. Such calculations rely on a global understanding of production processes that an integrated model from well-bore to topside facilities can supply. This paper focuses on key engineering issues that an FPSO project team needs to address as part of the overall development. Dynamic simulation is an essential part of the engineering process. This will be demonstrated with a review of dynamic process and flow assurance simulations applied to FPSO projects. A life-cycle simulator is a virtual plant that is used throughout the different engineering and operational phases. One dynamic process model is developed and leveraged through the entire project cycle from conceptual, Front End Engineering and Design (FEED), through commissioning phases all the way to operations and long-term operations support. From the early design stage, the models constitute a virtual field to determine the best production scheme. Based on the chosen design, this virtual plant is used to develop and validate reliable, safe and optimal operating procedures long before the actual plant comes on line. To aid in safe and effective commissioning, the virtual plant is employed to verify control & safety logic, pre-tune instrumentation, and train operations personnel. Once the plant comes on line and normal operations begin, the virtual plant is then used in a variety of ways to improve day-to-day performance. This is accomplished by testing, validating and instructing the operators in basic good operating practices and optimization theories, for anticipating upcoming production changes, and testing various operating strategies. Dynamic simulation benefits for FPSO projects will be highlighted, from FEED stage, stand-alone equipment, holistic simulation models and support to operation. The simulation domain may vary from a single compressor to design validation, from sequence and control parameters to the entire FPSO topsides and associated sea lines to examine the impact of liquid slug occurrence on the compression section. RSI is currently involved in five on-going FPSO projects for West Africa, Brazil and Norway. This paper presents lessons learned from previous and current life cycle dynamic simulation projects, most particularly for FPSO and offshore platforms. This paper explains different applications of dynamic simulation based on most recent FPSO and offshore projects using INDISS™, the RSI dynamic simulation platform.

AB  - Accurate prediction of net hydraulic fracture propagation pressure is often impossible. Under some conditions the pressure drop along the fracture dominates while in other cases the pressure at the tip determines the net pressure. Properly scaled lab tests and modeling indicate that effective stress determines the tip propagation pressure, but this is hard to confirm with field data in specific cases. We therefore gathered a large data base of fracture treatments from many areas to investigate the correlation between net pressure and effective stress. In order to avoid any spurious effect from fluid friction, tortuosity and height containment we limited the data to relatively small injections with water or linear gel in vertical wells. All treatments were in conventional clastic reservoirs, but over a large range of permeability, rock stiffness and geological age. The data show a remarkably good correlation between net pressure and effective reservoir stress, with a slope of 0.46. Lower net pressure of 200-300 psi was found in over pressured reservoirs and higher net pressure of about 1500 psi was seen in depleted reservoirs. We checked that this is not due to another underlying parameter, such as modulus or depth, which could explain the correlation. It is concluded that the correlation is due to a true relation between net pressure (controlled by fracture propagation) and effective stress. Simulation of representative treatments with a new model that includes a cohesive zone at the fracture tip shows excellent agreement with the observed correlation, supporting a physical relation. The relation between net pressure and effective stress in the reservoir can contribute to improved treatment design in green fields and also will aid in understanding fracture height growth, since effective stress will differ between formation layers. Calibrated models will still be important in view of lack of detailed formation knowledge, but a correct description of the physics of fracture propagation, based on effective stress at the tip, will facilitate more accurate model predictions.

AB  - ABSTRACT:Computational modeling aspects of weak plunging wave breaking, over a relatively mild sloping laboratory beach, were investigated in the present paper. Comparisons against latest elaborate experimental data were used to support the discussion. Smoothed Particle Hydrodynamics method was implemented as a numerical tool and the recently enhanced version of the academic ‘open source’ code SPHysics v.2 was ratified. Fine spatial resolution calibration was undertaken in an attempt to render effective a Sub-Particle Scale Smagorinsky-type turbulence closure that treats energy dissipation of eddy formations for the unresolved flow scales. Fine visual reproduction of the ragged freesurface flow deformation was supplemented with plausible results concerning classic wave dynamics characteristics, sophisticated turbulent surf-zone features and wave-induced currents. INTRODUCTIONNear-shore wave breaking, consequent turbulence transport and the resulting mean flows in the surf zone have always been and still remain major issues for engineers and scientists in their quest to comprehend, fully describe and predict the evolution of coastal processes. Particularly in the surf zone, the wave pattern goes through extremely abrupt changes and the emerging flow field becomes highly unstable and violent, especially during plunging-type wave breaking. Physical modeling of the latter over even, mild sloping, laboratory beach-type formations (e.g. Ting & Kirby, 1994) has set the grounds of profound insight on the matter, yet experimental efforts relate always to specific hydraulic and geometric laboratory conditions. Nowadays the use of conditionally flexible enhanced computational approaches is imperatively necessary. Thus rigorous validation of them discerns among modern coastal hydrodynamics research endeavours. In this framework, Grilli et al. (2001) used a higher-order Boundary Element Method (BEM) to simulate a 3D overturning solitary wave, yet only in terms of free surface elevation. The respective velocity field was reproduced in Guyenne and Grilli (2003), though not including any vortical pattern representation.

AB  - Summary Mineral compositional analysis of rocks is important for developing shale resources because the relationships between mineral compositions and petrophysical properties are critical for resource evaluation and completion optimization. Elementary properties are now routinely analyzed at wells in evaluating shale reservoirs. However, these properties have not been modeled in the three-dimensional (3D) reservoir. This is because an elemental composition has a physical constraint that is relatively easily adhered to in data analysis for wells but not in 3D modeling of reservoirs. A critical condition of elemental composition is that the sum of its components is equal to 100% to honor the mass-preservation principle. Traditional modeling methods do not satisfy this physical condition, sometimes producing nonphysical values, such as negative porosity values and fluid-saturation values greater than 100%. To date, only the compositional-modeling methods using a log-ratio transform can consistently satisfy this physical constraint. This paper presents modeling methods using additive log-ratio transform for modeling mineral compositions.

AB  - ABSTRACT: This paper describes an application of a numerical technique for computing the dynamic displacements and stresses induced by mining in an assumed infinite, homogeneous, isotropic, linearly-elastic rock mass. A two-dimensional direct boundary integral method is used as the basis for the numerical model, which determines the solution in a two-stage process. In the first stage, the static state of stress around the existing excavation in the region of interest is found by using a computer model for elastostatics. Then, in the second stage, an elastodynamics computer model is used to remove the appropriate "initial" stresses from the locations of the newly excavated boundary to create the required traction-free boundary condition for the enlarged excavation. By superimposing the static and dynamic solutions, one can compute the displacements and stresses at any location in the rock mass, at any time. An example is given to demonstrate the efficacy of the numerical model and to illustrate the dynamic effects that can occur when an underground excavation is enlarged by blasting.INTRODUCTIONMany important practical problems in rock mechanics and mining engineering involve dynamic phenomena. For example, the response of an underground excavation Subjected to transient loading caused by an explosion, a rockburst, or an earthquake cannot be quantified without Considering dynamic effects. In mining, blasting is the most frequently used means to extract ore from the host rock and to excavate shafts and stopes. The stress waves generated by blasting will reflect from these openings and refract around them, creating a potential for spalling of the supporting walls. In addition, these dynamic events may cause separation or slip along pre-existing geologic discontinuities within the mined area.This paper is concerned with the development and application of a boundary element method for two-dimensional elastodynamics problems. For linear elastodynamics problems in the absence of body forces, this method requires only a surface discretization of the region of interest. Thus the spatial dimension of the problem is reduced by one as compared With "domain-type" techniques (e.g., the finite element method) which require a discretization of the interior as well as the boundary. For problems involving an infinite domain, the boundary element method automatically satisfies the correct boundary conditions at infinity, thus eliminating the need for special transmitting boundaries to avoid spurious reflections at the extremities of a finite domain model.In this study two boundary element methods are combined to simulate numerically the dynamics of mining. First, a static method is used to compute the stress field surrounding an initially excavated stope. A dynamic method (Crouch and Tian 1988) is then used to simulate the dynamic process of blasting by applying dynamic incremental tractions to the newly excavated boundary in a suitable fashion which eventually satisfies the traction-free boundary condition. Finally, the sum of the static and incremental dynamic results gives the total elastodynamic response at any spatial location and time during the entire process.GOVERNING EQUATIONSLet V denote the volume occupied by a homogeneous

AB  - ABSTRACTThe wake interaction phenomenon among wind turbines has a great influence on aerodynamic power output, wind speed deficit turbulence stress and wake vortex structure, which indicates that more attention should be placed on the wake interaction for the optimal arrangement of wind farm. In this present study, firstly a numerical validation of aerodynamics for the two offset model wind turbines using actuator line model and CFD technique. The results obtained from the present simulations are compared to the data from the experiment “Blind Test 3” and other simulation models. Based on the simulations results, the present study shows good agreement with the experimental results. Then considering the uniform inflow condition, the complex phenomenon of wake interaction in wind farm containing fourteen wind turbines is simulated using a numerical method. Large eddy simulations combined with an actuator line model are conducted in the in-house CFD code FOWT-UALM-SJTU Solver. The motivation for this work is to create a sound methodology for performing the simulation of large wind farms. To better understand the wake interaction phenomenon, the aerodynamic power coefficients and basic features of both the near and far wake, including the distribution characteristics of the mean wake velocity and vortex structures are studied in detail.INTRODUCTIONWith the rapid development of wind energy technology, wind turbines have showed the rapid increase in both the total number of wind turbines installed and the maximum wind power capacity, increasing number of wind farms are built around the world (Jeon, 2013). Wind farms composed of large capacity wind turbines will become the future trend of development of wind energy (Abderrazzaq and Hahn, 2006). Wind turbines built in clusters will inevitably be affected by the wake of upstream and neighboring turbines. The wake interaction among wind turbines will lead to the decreased inflow wind velocity and increased turbulence intensity (Sanderse, 2011). Decreased total production of power and increased levels of fatigue loads are imposed on the turbines in the wind farm due to the phenomenon of wake interaction. Therefore, numerical simulations of wind farm containing multiple wind turbines are carried out to study characteristics of aerodynamic power and the significant wake interference effect, which have very important scientific significance and practical reference value for the wind farm layout optimization.

AB  - Abstract AMOR field is located in one of the OMLs in conventional offshore area of Nigeria, in about 62m water depth. The AMOR field comprises of two production platforms namely Amor production platform-1 (APP-1), Amor production platform-2 (APP-2) and two other satellites platforms namely APP-3 and APP-4. Two-phase (gas-liquid) separation of fluid from AMOR field i.e. APP-1, APP-2 and its satellite facilities (APP-3 and APP-4) is achieved on AMOR production platform (APP-2). The liquid (oil and water) is then pumped in multi-phase mode to a Floating Storage and Ofloading (FSO) vessel located 4km away, through a 24” pipeline (APP-2 oil export line), where oil and water are separated by gravitation (see Fig 1). This 24”AMOR (APP-2) liquid export pipeline to the FSO has two Emergency Shutdown valves (ESDVs) on the import hoses at the turret, downstream the Pipeline End Manifold (PLEM), going to the inlet of the FSO vessel. The pressure surge generated by the closure of these ESDVs has the potential to cause leakages through failures or rupture in the subsea system, including the PLEM upstream the ESDVs, because of the possibility of exceeding the design pressure of 19 bar g. In 2002, the risk of pressure surge (with differential surge pressure reaching about 24 bar g) because of, water hammer effect generated by the closure of the  ESDVs and a Shutdown valve (SDV) on the FSO (where facilities like the heat exchanger is rated at 12 bar g), was identified by dynamic simulation using Pipenet software. This risk was accentuated by the absence of an over-pressure protection device except, for a Pressure Safety Valve (PSV-1) positioned at APP-2 departure, on the 24” APP-2 liquid export line to the FSO and set at 19 bar g. Mitigation for this risk was possibly left out by oversight, as this field is now mature and designed with an older specification.

AB  - Abstract Most reservoir simulations use vertical flow performance (VFP) tables to represent flow in the tubing, which ignores the flow dynamics in wells and their downstream gathering and transportation networks. On the other hand, most dynamic well-pipeline flow models use pressure-rate equations to describe the inflow/injection from/to the reservoir, which ignores the flow and pressure transients in the near-wellbore regions. Obviously, neither of the two types of modeling can account for the transient reservoir-well/pipeline flow interactions that can be of great importance in many operation scenarios. To bridge this modeling gap, a joint industry program (JIP) was initiated based on a previous successful investigation [1] on the feasibility to implicitly couple a reservoir model to a dynamic well-pipeline multiphase flow model. The aim of the JIP was to deliver a simulation tool that can fulfill the industry's basic requirements on the modeling of transient flow interactions across the sandface, which should also lay the foundation for its future expansion in functionalities. This paper is intended to summarize the outcomes of the JIP. First of all, the paper discusses the need for integrated dynamic modeling and reviews earlier efforts on building integrated dynamic reservoir-well/pipeline systems. Secondly the paper describes the details of building the reservoir model and how to couple it to a well-pipeline flow model to assure numerical stability and simulation speed for cases of interest. Thirdly, the paper shows the PVT and fluid handling options the integrated simulation tool can provide. These are identical for the two models in order to keep the consistence of fluid properties particularly when the same fluid flows back-and-forth between the wellbore and the near-wellbore during transients. Two application cases based on the resulting model are presented in the paper. One case is about simulation of chemical squeezement hydraulics for refining the operational procedure, and the other case is about quantification of the pressure gradient in the near-wellbore formation for different well bean-up procedures in order to prevent sand production. The two cases demonstrate the advantages of using the coupled wellbore-reservoir transient modeling. Introduction Over the last thirty years, dynamic modeling of multiphase flow in production systems has gained significant development. Taking example of the OLGA [2,3,4] simulator, one can already get the capability of modeling the whole production network from the sandface at downhole to the receiving facilities at topside. People now realize that due to its non-linear nature, the modeling of flow dynamics in the production systems cannot cut off the upstream from its downstream unconditionally as the flow transients in the downstream can be felt instantaneously by the upstream and vice versa. For example, when modeling slugging phenomena in offshore risers, using a controlled pressure at the riser hang-off as the outlet boundary will give very different simulation results compared to when the separator is included in the model. Even if the separator has the same pressure level as in the former case, the small fluctuations in response to the incoming flow surges are large enough to change the slugging behavior significantly in the riser [5]. These two-way dynamic flow interactions can be modeled correctly only when all the involved flow components are included in one model. This is in contrast to the conventional modeling methodology such as the Nodal® analysis which is often adopted by steady-state calculations. For some situations where even the separator cannot be taken as a realistic boundary, the dynamic pipeline model has to be coupled to the process simulator in order to get the right pressure response at its outlet. For the process simulator the coupling to the pipeline models provides more accurate feeds, which should facilitate a more realistic modeling of the fluid knock-on effect on the downstream process.

AB  - SUMMARY Wellhead- and process emergency shutdown systems are complex in the sense that their design has to rely on knowledge from many different disciplines. This paper discusses the most common weaknesses in traditional ESD system design and proposes some modifications with emphasis on the hydraulic part of topside ESD systems. The information is based on inspections carried out on most installations in the Norwegian sector of the North Sea, countless interviews of offshore personnel and design experience from some of the largest platforms in the world. It also outlines possible simplifications and cost savin9s during upgrading of old systems. A newly developed valve that has the potential to reduce complexity and save costs in ESD systems is presented. In subsea control systems, the new technology can reduce installation costs considerably by reducing the need for electrical cables. The paper is relevant to designers of wellhead- and process emergency shutdown systems, hydraulic power units, and accumulator banks. INTRODUCTION Norway is now one of the world's largest oil exporters, and the country also exports natural gas. All the Norwegian hydrocarbon reserves are located offshore and it is complicated and expensive to exploit them. For this reason, safety considerations have always had high priority since the offshore activities began in 1967. The reliability of an emergency shut-down system is crucial to total safety and operation of the offshore installation. Therefore, most safety systems are designed fail-safe. This reduces the risk of fail-to-dangermodes of failure but it leads to frequent unintended shutdowns. Such events are highly undesirable due to the production losses involved. They also represent acertain threat to safety because they impose additional loads on some components and can result in faults due to human interaction. Human factors are an important aspect of safety system reliability and availability. Some of the nuisance shutdowns are caused by humans, generally while doing maintenance or testing of a system. Such activities are of great importance and accordingly more effort should be put into the design of equipment for easy installation, maintenance, and testing. Lack of basic skills in hydraulics and pneumatics, bothb for engineers, installation contractor, and servicepersonnel seems to be one of the most common problems associated with already installed systems.This has generally lead to more complicated systems and less efficient maintenance than required. Theproblem, is to some extent, present in all offshore hydraulic systems, such as cranes, winches, and drilling ystems. Producing a good design of a well control system means combining detailed knowledge about valve technology, accumulator banks, Hydraulic Power Units, well operations, well testing procedures, christmas tree testing procedures, wireline operations, snubbing and drilling operations, regulations and different kinds of emergency situations. It is a complex task. THE OFFSHORE EMERGENCY SHUTDOWN SYSTEM The Norwegian Petroleum Directorate's regulations, reference 1, section 18 relating to safety andcommunication systems, stare: installations with equipment containing hydrocarbons shall have an emergency shutdown system,... The system shall prevent or limit the consequences of leakage and shalleliminate potential ignition sources .

AB  - ABSTRACTReef and concrete stabilising pillars are modelled in the two dimensional plane strain code FLAC. The rock mechanics criteria used for comparison are hangingwall stability, pillar stress distribution and stope closure profile, as well as the punching effect of the pillar into the foundation. Foundation failure is qualitatively the same as that shown by Wagner and Schumann (1971). Results show that hangingwall stability may be promoted, and the punching effect much reduced, by the use of a concrete pillar, thus making the use of a concrete pillar justified.

AB  - GEOPHYSICAL STUDY OF THE ORPHEUS GRAVITY ANOMALY INTRODUCTION Marine geophysical investigations have been carried out on the eastern seaboard of Canada by the Geological Survey of Canada, the Institute of Oceanography (Dal- housie University) and the Bedford Institute of Ocean- ography, since 1959. The early investigations were made with a shipborne magnet0meter.l. These studies were followed by shipborne gravimeter and two-ship seismic refraction methods. The most significant dis- covery to date is an extensive belt of large negative gravity anomalies, that Loncarevic3 named "Orpheus" after the Orpheus Rocks off Madame Island, Nova Scotia. The Orpheus Rocks are near the presently established western limit of the anomaly (Fig. 1). The anomaly extends from the entrance of Cheda- bucto Bay in the west and trends in a remarkably straight line to the southwest wall of the Laurentian Channel. The same gravity trend continues across the Laurentian Channel, with isolated negative anomalies reaching a minimum of - 60 mgal contained within it. The free air anomaly is continuous within the -20 mgal contour for a distance greater than 325 km. The Orpheus gravity anomaly and postulated causa- tive bodies can be related to known geology of the nearby mainland. However, this extension of land geology could not have been anticipated prior to the gravity survey. In addition to detecting this important feature, the shipborne gravimeter survey provided a most efficient means for extending seismic control. This approach offers a quick method for reconnais- sance mapping of continental shelves. Shipborne gravimeters are relatively new instru- ments; therefore, the first part of this paper describes the method of carrying out shipborne gravimeter sur- veys and discusses their accuracy. In the second part, the results of geophysical investigations are inter- preted in terms of the local geological setting. by B. D. LONCAREVIC and G. N. EWING Marine Geophysics Group, Bedford Institute of Oceanography, Canada THE SHIPBORNE GRAVIMETER METHOD This paper is based primarily on observations made with an Askania-Graf Sea Gravimeter (Ser. No. Gss- 2-17) acquired in 1963 by the Bedford Institute of Oceanography. Instruments of this type have been used for a variety of investigations in the past and are ade- quately described in literat~re.~.~ Sea trials of this type of shipborne gravimeter were first conducted by Worzel in 195K6 Up to the end of 1965 an estimated 200,000 km of gravity surveys have been carried out.? Most of these measurements were made along widely spaced tracks, and therefore publication of interpre- tations of detailed surveys are not numerous. In common with every other geophysical method shipborne gravimeters have limitations. Provided these limitations are properly understood, the method has great potential as a reconnaissance tool in the explora- tion of continental shelf areas. The factors affecting the accuracy of shipborne gravity observa

AB  - ABSTRACT:The static and seismic properties of single, artificial, tensile fractures in Berea sandstone were measured concurrently during normal compression to 24.3 MPa. Both the stress-displacement and seismic transmission measurements show that the fracture stiffness increases with stress in a highly nonlinear fashion with considerable hysteresis during the first loading cycle. Acoustic emission measurements confirm that the hysteresis results from inelastic grain and asperity crushing between the fracture surfaces. The fracture has a much larger effect on P- and S-wave amplitudes than on either the static or dynamic effective Young's moduli.INTRODUCTIONDetermination of the mechanical state of artificially induced, extensile fractures in rock is a problem of considerable importance in hydraulic fracturing. Borehole observations often show that microseismic activity persists after the fluid pressure has been released from the hydrofracture. It is conceivable that the microseismicity is generated by the failure of asperities between the surfaces of the hydrofracture during closure. Because hydrofractures open in the direction of the minimum principal stress, the two fracture surfaces should be well mated during closure. However, any heterogeneity in the stress could cause small shear displacements leading to an unmating of the fracture surfaces.The objective of this paper is to study the deformation of fractures under normal compression in Berea sandstone using stress-displacement, acoustic emission, and se- ismic wave transmission measurements. Tests are performed on both mated (well correlated) and unmated (uncorrelated) fractures. Acoustic emission is used to monitor inelastic grain crushing. Seismic transmission is used to relate the static elastic proper- ties of the fracture to its corresponding dynamic elastic properties and to determine the effect of the fracture on seismic wave attenuation.

AB  - The response of geologic materials subject to nuclear weapon effects is of considerable interest in the design of buried protective construction. Recently, more consideration has been given to placing such structures in rock rather than in soil. Although rock has the obvious advantages of high strength and low deformability, discontinuities such as joints and fault planes severely complicate any response analysis. Nevertheless, some knowledge of the effects of these discontinuities must be developed, even if that knowledge remains largely qualitative in nature. In this paper, we present a constitutive description of cracked rock subject to uniaxial shock loading. The constitutive equations are based on certain average response characteristics of a particular cracked rock model. Rather than attempt to represent each material discontinuity individually, we have incorporated the discontinuity effects into constitutive relationships for a continuous medium. The resulting equations are suitable for use in hydrodynamic computer codes presently used for ground motion calculations. APPROACHThe continuum description which will be presented below is based on a detailed analysis of a particular cracked rock model. This model can be visualized as a sequence of plates (representing the intact rock) separated by gaps (representing the discontinuities). This so-called "plate-gap" model was first used by Thouvenin (1) in an effort to explain the behavior of porous materials at high pressure. Other works using the plate-gap model to describe porous material response have been published by Heyda (2); Hoffman, Andrews, and Maxwell (3)', Prindle (4), and Kieffer (5).The CRAC-1 Computer CodeDetailed analysis of the plate-gap model response to various loading conditions was accomplished with the aid of a computer program called CRAC-1 (cf. Abbott and Davis (6)). This program employs a lumped mass analogy to solve the equations of motion describing one-dimensional wave propagation in the plate-gap material. The plate materials can be either linearly elastic or viscoelastic and a variety of boundary conditions can be employed. In the lumped mass analogy, the plates are visualized as a series of point masses, connected by linear springs and dashpots. For the linear elastic (undamped) case, it is possible to adjust the numerical value of the time step used in marching the solution forward so that the distance between masses divided by the time step is exactly equal to the velocity of propagation in the material to be modeled. This procedure allows the numerical solution to propagate discontinuous waveforms exactly (i.e., without any spurious effects caused by numerical dispersion or instability). This feature (the ability to numerically represent discontinuous waveforms) was deemed essential to adequately study the effects of gaps on the material response. Considerable care was taken so that all gaps within the plate-gap model closed exactly at the end of a time step. This was accomplished by a rigid body translation of all material below the closing gap during the time step directly preceding the instant of closure. Since the time steps were usually quite small, any translations which did occur were also very small. This precaution (insuring gap closure at the end of a time step) assured the correct transmission of waveforms from one plate to the next.

AB  - This is a summary and an extension of the ideas presented in two earlier papers dealing with the effects that data errors and model errors have upon the results from directional survey calculations. An important conclusion is that if any of five specific models is used the uncertainty, due to errors in data is much more serious than the uncertainty due to errors caused by the model. IntroductionThe degree of uncertainty in our knowledge of a position in a wellbore is important when dealing position in a wellbore is important when dealing with highly deviated wellbores drilled from urban, Arctic, and offshore drillsites. In this paper we shall draw heavily from the ideas developed in two earlier published articles, which should be read in conjunction with this paper for a complete understanding. In those papers we suggested that any errors in the calculation of a position in a wellbore can be analyzed as arising position in a wellbore can be analyzed as arising from two sources. One source of error is the inaccuracies in the data readings due mainly to instrumentation error. The other, usually lesser error. which we call model error, is due to the inaccuracies introduced by the use of an approximating model. Of course there are other obvious sources of error-common to any calculation - such as errors introduced when transcribing numbers, arithmetic errors, and errors due to the use of finite precision arithmetic either on or off a computer. However, we will assume that with care any errors in this category can be eliminated or made negligible. The errors arising from the two principal sources are discussed in the next two sections, which are then followed by a section dealing with the composite error. In our notation, probability distribution parameters pertaining to errors due to data inaccuracies are primed, parameters pertaining to model errors and to composite errors are pertaining to model errors and to composite errors are double primed and unprimed, respectively. We will describe the analysis as though the error were for the bottom-hole point, but bear in mind that the ideas can be applied to point, but bear in mind that the ideas can be applied to any other point in a wellbore. Following this, the inverse problem is considered: "How should a directional survey, and perhaps the well course, be planned so that the errors are kept within prescribed bounds?" prescribed bounds?" Errors Due to Data Inaccuracies In Ref. 1 we studied the effect of data reading errors on the calculated bottom-hole coordinates. Joint error characteristics for the survey reading instruments were estimated through discussions with representatives of the instrument manufacturers and service organizations. These characteristics in the form of error probability distributions are converted by a statistical analysis that produces the joint error probability distribution for the bottom-hole coordinates. The details of such a study are presented in Ref. 1. which could be applied to the Balanced Tangential Method." The analysis required in any particular case would of course depend on the model used. We have not performed the analysis for other models in general. It may not be possible to carry out the integrations analytically for any particular model, but in any case the Monte Carlo approach could be used to obtain the joint error distribution for results of interest by random sampling and simulation. Results are interpreted statistically as follows. JPT P. 1368

AB  - Abstract Typical workover operations involve the switching of subsea well barriers from permanent equipment to temporarily installed barrier systems. During workover activities additional operational hazards are introduced such as drive/drift off and compensator lockup which can have severe consequences including injury to personnel. To account for these operational hazards a workover system will have additional barriers. These barriers consist of instrumented and non-instrumented protective layers. The instrumented protective layers consist of safety instrumented systems (SIS). The safety instrumented systems fitted to a workover system can vary. Most workover systems consist of three common safety instrumented functions (SIF); Process Shutdown (PSD), Emergency Shutdown (ESD) and Emergency Quick Disconnect (EQD). The non-instrumented protective layers are made up from mechanical barrier elements for example the weak links. DNV GL on behalf of Statoil performed an analysis to better understand workover hazards and the barriers required to mitigate these. The aim of the work was to assess the effectiveness and suitability of the current safety barriers and to identify what additional functional requirements might be needed. This paper details the results of that work. A generic workover system formed the basis for the study. Hazards were defined through a hazard identification (HAZID) workshop and the effectiveness of the measures was evaluated through a Level of Protection Analysis (LOPA). This paper documents the results of a study to establish whether the current barriers used during workover operations adequately mitigate the risks. Despite having dissimilar operational modes, it is often expected that the workover system barriers shall be suitable for all operational modes. The results of this study show that some of the barriers in workover operations are not as efficient as perceived, in particular the riser weak link designs and manually initiated EQD functions.

AB  - AbstractDuring the past years a better understanding of the fracturing processes to enhance productivity in hydrocarbon and geothermal reservoirs has become more important for the industry. Within this context hydraulic fracturing type experiments on 150 mm edge length cube shaped blocks with a 13 mm diameter central borehole under different true-triaxial confining stresses up to 20 MPa have been conducted in this study. Deformations and Acoustic Emission (AE) were monitored throughout the experiments. Rock types that have been tested comprise rhyolites, sandstones and slates with low porosity and permeability. Fracturing has been conducted with water as a fracturing fluid and via pressurization of an elastic polymer sleeve to eliminate poroelastic effects. AE data evaluation revealed several characteristics of fracture initiation and propagation as ’trapping’ and ’deflection’ of the induced fractures at pre-existing fractures, branching and deviation of the induced fracture away from the expected orientation, differences in source types as well as fracture propagation parallel to the borehole. Also the activation of pre-existing fractures prior to fracture initiation and different kinds of fracture initiation patterns were observable.1. INTRODUCTIONHydraulic fracturing is applied in a broad range of applications as in hydrocarbon and geothermal reservoir productivity enhancement, stress measurements or stress relief in e.g. tunneling. Within this range of applications companies are confronted with changing lithological material properties, stress magnitudes, fracture dimensions and public vulnerability in the case of induced seismicity. The process of hydraulic fracturing is well understood for homogeneous and isotropic media [1]. Most rocks exhibit a certain degree of heterogeneity and anisotropy caused by bedding, cleavage or pre-existing discontinuities as joints or faults. For field hydraulic fracturing operations the dimensions of the induced fractures can be in similar dimensional scale to the before mentioned attributes. Therefore, fracture propagation direction, fracture geometry and injection pressures may be strongly affected by anisotropy [2]. Since the late 1970`s hydraulic fracturing experiments are conducted in the laboratory in combination with AE monitoring [3, 4, 5]. Throughout the decades AE monitoring of laboratory hydraulic fracturing experiments became more and more sophisticated by incorporating methods known from disciplines like seismology, seismics and non-destructive testing. These methods comprise precise arrivaltime detection algorithms [6, 7], different localization approaches allowing for anisotropic velocity fields [8, 9, 10], collapsing techniques [11, 12, 13], source type evaluation methods [14], couplants [15] and AE-tomography approaches [16, 17]. Furthermore, the availability of affordable monitoring hardware gave rise to the usage of the AE monitoring technique for laboratory experiments in geosciences.

AB  - ABSTRACT Previous studies qualitatively sketched that relative larger coherent turbulent motions generated in the crest region would stretch downward into the trough level during propagation of breaking wave in the surf zone. This event further suggests that an instantaneous burst of turbulence intensity will occur locally in the path of the penetrating turbulent motion. To observe such a spatial depended turbulent structure, the internal flow field of spilling wave propagating on an inclined bottom slope of 1/20 was measured quantitatively by Particle Image Velocimetry. The ensemble average method is employed to decompose the mean flow and turbulent fluctuations by repeating the same experiment for twenty-five times in each Field of View (FOV). Seven FOVs were integrated for representing the global results, which covers the breaking wave from the outer to inner surf zones. The temporal and spatial evolutions of the coherent turbulent structure were examined and discussed. Results manifest that a relative large turbulent motion is initially organized in the wave crest of the bore-established region. As the wave crest passed, this turbulent structure will then stretch downward to the interior region of the water column. Two important dynamic turbulence transport terms, the turbulent convection and diffusion, were estimated to investigate the underline mechanism of the turbulence transport. It is found that the convection term is much significant to spread the turbulent structure from the wave crest to trough region. INTRODUCTION The hydrodynamics of breaking waves in the surf zone has been an important subject for coastal and environmental engineering. Detailed reviews on hydrodynamics in the surf zone can be found in Peregrine(1983), Battjes (1988) and Christensen et al. (2002). Flow visualization is a powerful technique to experimentally investigate qualitative flow structures of wave breaking.

AB  - Estimating reservoir flow capacity is crucial for production estimation, hydraulic fracturing design and field development. Laboratory experiments can be used to measure the permeability of rock samples, but the results may not be representative at a field scale because of reservoir heterogeneity and pre-existing natural fracture systems. Diagnostic Fracture Injection Tests (DFIT) have now become standard practice to estimate formation pore pressure and formation permeability. However, in low permeability reservoirs, after-closure radial flow is often absent and this can cast significant uncertainties in interpreting DFIT data. In addition, the established methods for analyzing DFIT data make two oversimplified assumptions: (1) Carter's leak-off and, (2) Constant fracture compliance (or stiffness) during fracture closure. However, both assumptions are violated during fracture closure and this is why G-function based models and subsequent related works can lead to an incorrect interpretation and are not capable of consistently fitting both before and after closure data coherently (Wang and Sharma 2017). Moreover, current after-closure analysis relies on classic well-test solutions with constant injection rate. In reality, a "constant injection rate" does not equal "constant leak-off rate into the formation", because over 90% of the injected fluid stays inside the fracture at the end of pumping, instead of leaking into formation. The variable leak-off rate clearly violates the constant rate boundary condition used in existing well-test solutions. In this study, we extend our previous work and derive time-convolution solutions to pressure transient behavior of a closing fracture with infinite and finite fracture conductivity. We show that G-function and the square root of time models are only special cases of our general solutions. In addition, we found that after-closure linear flow and bilinear flow analysis can only be used to infer pore pressure reliably, but fail to estimate other parameters correctly. Most importantly, we present a new approach to history match the entire duration of DFIT data to estimate formation flow capacity, even without knowing closure stress and the roughness properties of the fracture surface. Our approach adds tremendous value to DFIT interpretation and uncertainty analysis, especially in unconventional reservoirs where the absence of after-closure radial flow is the norm. Two representative field cases are also presented and discussed.

AB  - One of the most important characteristics of tabular mine stress analysis is the need to represent the complex evolution of mining face positions and the accompanying induced stress changes in the rock mass. Integration of seismic activity with numerical modelling requires flexible and efficient solution schemes in which both off-reef damage and large-scale fault slip can be effectively represented. A new approach is investigated in which the stope closure and ride variables can be found using a moving least squares estimator. Some advantages of this approach over traditional element-based tessellation schemes are identified. At the same time, shortcomings of this method are noted when the displacement discontinuity variable is approximated by a polynomial shape function. Difficulties and possible solutions to the shape function formulation near excavation edges are discussed.Une des caracteristiques les plus importantes de l'analyse des contraintes minières tabulaires est la necessite de representer la complexe evolution des positions du front de taille et des changements concomitants des contraintes occasionnees dans la masse rocheuse. L'integration de l'activite sismique avec la modelisation numerique requiert des projets souples et efficaces qui permettent la representation des dommages hors-filon et des glissements de faille à grande echelle. Une approche nouvelle est etudiee qui permet de trouver la fermeture de la taille et les variables de montage en utilisant un estimateur par les moindres carres mobile. Certains des avantages de cette approche sur les traditionnels projets bases sur une structure en mosaïque sont identifies. En même temps, les defauts de cette methode sont notes lorsqu'on calcule la variable de discontinuite du deplacement approximativement par une fonction de forme polynomiale. Les difficultes et solutions possibles à la formulation de la fonction forme près des bords d'excavation sont discutes.Eine der wichtigsten Charaketeristika der taublaren Grubenspannungsanalayse ist die Notwendigkeit, die komplexe Entwicklung der Abbaupositionen und der damit verbundenen induzierten Spannungsanderungen der Gesteinsmasse neu vorzulegen. Die Integration der seismischen Tatigkeit mit einem numerischen Modell erfordert flexible und effiziente Lösungsschemata, in denen sowohl Schaden ausserhalb des Riffs als auch Verwerfungen großen Ausmaßes effektiv dargestellt werden. Ein neuer Vorstoß wird untersucht in welchem die Strossenschliessung und Schneisenvariablen unter Verwendung des Schatzwertes der kleinsten quadratischen Abweichungen (Gaussscher Schatzwert) gefunden werden. Einige Vorteile dieser Annaherung im Vergleich zu der traditionellen Element-basierenden Tessellation sind identifiziert. Gleichzeitig werden Unzulanglichkeiten dieser Methode vermerkt, wenn die Verschiebungsdiskoniuitatsvariable durch eine polynomische Formfunktion angepaßt wird. Schwierigkeiten und mögliche Lösungen zur Formfunktionsformulierung nahe Exkavationsrandern werden besprochen.IntroductionTabular mining occurs ubiquitously in the extraction of gold, coal and platinum reserves in South Africa. A useful computational scheme to analyse these problems is provided by the displacement discontinuity method (DDM), introduced originally in South Africa by Salamon (Salamon, 1963). This method of analysis provides a starting point for many routine mine design tasks that involve the estimation of expected stress distributions away from the reef plane, design of regional support systems, the assessment of fault slip potential and the explicit simulation of seismic behaviour. The DDM is useful also as a complementary tool for the provision of background boundary conditions in detailed inelastic simulations that may be carried out by special purpose finite element or distinct element codes.Integration of seismic activity with numerical modelling requires appropriate representations of rock mass damage and efficient solutions of complex, multi-step mining problems. These include effective use of fast Fourier methods for parallel reef or layer problems (Spottiswoode, 2001) where mined areas are tessellated with regular square elements. Each element is assigned a “mined” or “unmined” status and the unknown displacement discontinuity vector is assumed to be constant within each element.

AB  - INTRODUCTIONIn 1982 and 1983, as part of the mine design program for a New Brunswick potash mine, series of laboratory tests were conducted on potash and salt samples obtained during the mine exploration program. Concurrently, two rock mechanics monitoring programs were initiated in situ: the short term test at site A, and the long term test at site B (figures 1 and 2).SHORT TERM TEST (FIGURE 1)The purpose of this test was to obtain a quick confirmation of laboratory data and comparison of the rock response to excavation with the data available from Saskatchewan potash mines. Instrumentation in the main drift was installed on Day 4 after excavation, and the pressure cells were pressurized on Day 33. The packer type cells in the east crosscut were pressurized on Day 25. Excavation of the west cross-cut was begun on Day 71. This "mine by" test has provided important information required for calibration of laboratory tests, as will be shown later. The test data recorded are shown in a series of diagrams:initial room closures, main drift-figure 3;convergence graphs, main drift-figure 4stresses recorded, main drift-figures 5 to 8 and, stresses recorded, east crosscut - figure 15Three types of instruments were used in this test. In the main drift, Saskatchewan Research Council water type hydraulic inclusions, encapsulated in potash, were used to measure lateral and vertical stresses. In the east crosscut a home-made packer type hydraulic inclusion was used to record radial stresses. The convergence stations consisted of end-grouted bars of reinforcing steel.LONG TERM TEST (FIGURE 2)The purpose of the long term test was to study the steady-state behaviour of a single opening in potash. Site B was placed in aremote area of the mine, well away from any anticipated early mining activities. To assure homogeneity of rock mass, the site was placed within a 30 meter thick vertical limb of a syncline-shaped ore body contained within a 360 metre thick vertical section of salt rocks. It was excavated mechanically as close as possible to the designed square cross-section for the entire length of the room. The square cross- section was chosen in order to achieve a comparable geometry in vertical and horizontal directions; that is, to eliminate any undesired effects of geometry interaction with lithostratigraphy which might have generated non-homogeneous behavior. The site was extensively instrumented. As in site A, the convergence stations consisted of end-grouted bars of reinforcing steel. However, in order to avoid any measurement inaccuracies which would be associated with the brittle yield zone in the opening walls, bars were placed to the same depth in opposite sides of the opening. This allowed the convergence measurement to be obtained as the absolute convergence between two points, rather than the convergence of a single point with respect to a potentially unstable reference. For stress measurements the Saskatchewan Research Council cells were placed vertically, laterally and radially. Unfortunately, due to cost considerations, it was decided to use a compacted sand, rather than grout, to encapsulate the cells in the boreholes.

AB  - Abstract Data acquisition is one of the most critical parts to a sound reservoir management across the whole petroleum industry history. There are more challenges in brown fields, especially offshore fields. With the pace of moving to digital oil field (DOF), more surveillance equipment and methods are becoming available. Hence oil recovery could be improved with more accurate reservoir management. Maximizing the utilization of testing equipment and acquired data are becoming more fundamental than ever. This paper presents two field cases from one of the biggest offshore fields. The first case is to maximize the value of available testing equipment through optimizing data acquisition plans. The second case shows a trial of maximizing utilization of the acquired data. As one of the steps moving toward digital oil field, MultiPhase Flow Meter (MPFM) has been installed for more frequent flow tests. In addition to normal flow tests, this paper presents a new role for MPFM, which is to identify communication between strings in dual-string wells. Communication between strings is a high potential risk in this giant offshore field, because majority of the wells are dual strings. Wells with communication between strings have been identified during routine flow tests with no extra cost. In order to assure the feasibility of this approach, conventional communication test through downhole pressure measurement has been performed. Using MPFM to do communication test can save a considerable amount of expenditure comparing to the conventional method. Early actions can also be ensured to avoid reservoir cross-flow. Besides, the volume of communication can also be measured, which could help decide the optimum rate and optimize back allocation. The flow test results are fundamental data for reservoir management and field development. The widely used results are the fluid flow rates. However, the value of temperature data was not fully revealed. The paper presents an empirical correlation derived from measurements. The empirical correlations between WHFT (Well Head Flow Temperature) and flow rate have been generated for each oil production string based on flow test data. The high quality correlations have been utilized to optimize back allocation with conditions. The value of the empirical correlation is more prominent when there are unseen obstructions in the production system. The temperature data in daily operation also indicates abnormal well performance (e.g. DHSV malfunction, scale deposition). Early actions can be planned and taken to avoid further production loss and improve operation efficiency. The two field cases in such a brown field happened in a pre-DOF age, which also shed light on the bright future of digital oil field and better reservoir management.

AB  - ABSTRACT:A displacement discontinuity method has been developed for solving three-dimensional dynamic problems. The technique has been used to investigate the dynamic response of supported and unsupported excavations in tabular orebodies. A case is also presented in which slip on a natural feature produces significant effects in the mined excavation. The new technique provides predictions of velocities and dynamic stress concentrations which are not provided by conventional static methods. It is shown that the dynamic response may be significantly different from that inferred from static analyses, and that this method is a useful tool for the analysis of realistic mining situations in which dynamic events such as rockbursts occur.1 INTRODUCTIONBoundary element methods have evolved to the stage that they are now widely accepted as an alternative to methods such as finite elements in many fields of mechanics. This paper describes the development of a boundary element method known as the three-dimensional Explicit Dynamic Displacement Discontinuity Method (EDDDM), and presents several examples of problems which illustrate its use for computing the dynamic displacements and stresses caused by sudden changes in the geometry of an underground excavation, and by mining-induced slip on a joint or fault plane (in three dimensions). The prediction of velocities of closure occurring in mined excavations offers the ability to predict the behavior of support elements. Also, quantitative estimates of dynamic stress concentrations should lead to a better understanding of the mechanisms of transient phenomena such as rockbursts, where the dynamic stresses may differ significantly from the static values. The mining problems addressed by the EDDDM all involve excavations in tabular orebodies, which are thin (a few meters or less) in one dimension and extensive (hundreds or even thousands of meters) in the other two. Static boundary element methods (in particular, displacement discontinuity methods) are a standard design tool for problems of this type (Plewman et al. 1969; Starfield and Crouch 1973; Crouch and Starfield 1983; Ryder 1988) and similar kinds of problems can be solved with the dynamic model. The same numerical model can be used to study the associated problems of sudden slip or separation on a pre-existing geological discontinuity. 2 THEORETICAL DEVELOPEMENTThis brief description of the three-dimensional dynamic displacement discontinuity method is given only to indicate the principles on which it is based, and to highlight some of the advantages and disadvantages compared to other methods. This approach falls into the class of boundary element methods known as indirect methods but the solution quantities have physical significance in the problems investigated here. Boundary element methods are numerical schemes to solve the same physical problems which are typically posed as differential equations, except that they are cast in integral form. By appropriate manipulation, the integral equations over the entire domain are converted into surface integrals over only the boundary of the domain. The boundary is divided into elements (boundary elements) and the boundary conditions are satisfied approximately on the elements, usually at the center of each element.

AB  - Abstract: Geomechanical uncertainties inherent to the Pre-salt wellbores may be responsible for severe operational and environmental impacts, since drilling deep wellbores in salt rock formations is challenging and risky. The aim of this research is to assess the potential risk to the wellbore related to salt creep. For this purpose, a finite element model of a Pre-salt like synthetic wellbore is used. The evaluation scenario considers an elliptic borehole in which the casing remains uncovered by the cementation sheath. The emergence of plastic deformation in the casing is considered here as a failure event. The salt rock (halite) is modelled as an elasto-viscoplastic material, and creep behavior is simulated using the sophisticated Multi-mechanism Deformation model. Uncertainties associated to the key parameters for salt creep behavior are taken into account as random variables described by probability distributions. The fast probability integration Mean Value methods are adopted to obtain the cumulative probability distribution for the time when the failure event occurs. The probabilistic analyses have highlighted that the most important variables for salt creep and associated threats are those related to the stress state, temperature and creep-rate parameters. In this research, the probability of the casing undergoing plastic deformation before the time predicted by the deterministic analysis is 40%. The results show that even representative geomechanical models with sophisticated constitutive laws can lead to an unreliable solution when parameter uncertainties are neglected. Introduction Geomechanical uncertainties inherent to the Pre-salt wellbores may introduce severe operational and environmental impacts, since drilling deep wellbores in salt rock formations is challenging and risky. Typically, wellbore integrity analysis relies on several geomechanical parameters taken as deterministic values, and the results are directly related to that specific parameter set. Hence, even the most sophisticated geometric models may not provide an accurate response whenever the parameter variability is not considered. Having in mind the operational threats related to the Pre-salt exploration, one can observe that the uncertainties omitted in the deterministic analyses may represent severe financial and environmental costs. Hence, considering the complexity of this scenario and the duality between risk and benefit, it is highly advisable to take into account the uncertainties related to the geotechnical parameters.

AB  - The artificial lift system selected to produce the Jubarte Field uses high-power and high-flow-rate subsea electrical submersible pump (ESP) systems with gas lift as a contingency in case of the need for ESP replacement. The gas lift mandrels are installed in the production well completion. The ESP systems are rated for 1,500 hp at full load and were deployed inside caissons constructed on the seabed, located 210 m downstream of the main production wellhead. The integrated unit is called a pumping module or módulo de bombeio (MOBO) in Portuguese. Industry perception of average ESP run time, high replacement costs associated with intervention of the subsea ESP systems, and the limited track record available for comparable systems at the time of field development required a comprehensive approach to improve on system reliability from the beginning. The use of advanced technologies to extend the traditional concept of industrial process control to the management of the MOBO systems allowed continuous monitoring of ESPs to maintain operation within the design envelope. The development of a complete "ESP culture" became a key element connecting the different teams involved in the operation. This required new procedures to be developed, new monitoring and surveillance teams introduced, and, most of all, management of change practices introduced to avoid issues related to the rotation of personnel involved in the operation of the ESP and related systems. The synergies created allowed the provision of timely solutions to face the challenges across the complete production system. The gap study conducted at the beginning of the Jubarte ESP development identified many barriers and conditions preventing increased system reliability and affecting economic viability of such a large-scale project. This paper builds on such analysis using the operational data gathered during the 8 years of ESP operation, shows improvement in mean time to failure during the period, presents typical failures encountered in equipment and processes, introduces the de-risking process followed to strengthen the system, and provides the reasons behind the enhancements made.

AB  - Abstract Total E&P Indonesie (TEPI) is the main gas producer in Indonesia which produces around 1900 MMscf/d of gas. One of the challenges is to maintain its production plateau under liquid loading issue. Almost half of TEPI gas production comes from liquid-loaded wells, representing 85% of total producing wells in the affiliate. Up until recently, dewatering activity in TEPI is only performed by means of regular offloads; involving substantial means. These operations present specific risks not only for safety and assets but also for environment by flaring of gas through testing barge. A cross functional team has been established to find out innovative solution based on the “Foam Assisted Lift” (FAL) principle and enabling to keep existing DHSV in the well completion. The FAL principle consists in offloading the wells by creating foam down-hole through continuous injection of surfactant to help liquid lifting and gas breakthrough.  This paper describes Capillary String Injection System that can be fitted into existing wells, using existing DHSV control line for surfactant injection while keeping its primary safety function as a fail-safe device. The installation equipment includes a modified wireline-retrievable surface-controlled sub-surface safety valve (WR-SCSSV) with capillary tubing attached below it. Injection operates via existing control line of the safety valve to inject chemicals, does not require any further wellhead modification.  In addition, this system fits perfectly with the context of mature field; simple, cost-effective, safe and easy to handle. Introduction Liquid loading of gas wells is one of Total E&P Indonésie (TEPI) main challenges. It is the phenomenon of inability to lift liquids out from the gas well. Liquid therefore starts to accumulate in the borehole, increasing significantly the hydrostatic pressure. Gas rate will drop significantly as a result. Then, self-killing process starts. The wells are in loading mode when the produced gas is below critical rate,I t is the so-called “Turner Rate”. Almost half of TEPI gas production comes from wells prone to self-killing.As of April, 2014; it represents 85% of the total producing wells in the affiliate. Therefore recovering all reserves from very weak wells, and from “supposed dead” wells, is the challenge of this technology. Until recently, dewatering of wells in TEPI is performed by means of regular offloads by flaring, involving substantial means (testing barges and personnel). Offloading is done by connecting the well to a testing barge, and setting the wellhead pressure at the lowest pressure possible (equal to atmospheric pressure). These operations present specific risks, not only for safety of personnel and assets, but also for the environment when flaring gas through the testing barge, which results in Green House Gas (GHG) emissions. Moreover, they remain “spot” treatments that do not tackle the cause of liquids loading and have only a temporary effect on production gains. Other conventional offloading solutions such as plunger lift, wellhead compressor, velocity string and gas lifting cannot be applied due to either economical factor and/or because of incompliance with TEPI Rules.

Abstract Current estimates of gas in place in the Devonian Shales of the Appalachian Basin range up to 2,500 TCF. For the most part, the majority of this resource is tied up in the shale matrix and the source and reservoir of this gas is the same as the low permeability and porosity of the shale prevents migration of the gas to a more classical reservoir rock. Where there is fracturing of the shales, the fracture network serves as a reservoir and wells drilled in the area of fracturing tend to be good producers. producers. For exploration purposes, the most probable areas for drilling of the shales are those that have a high density of natural fracturing. Aerial photography has been used to locate potential drilling sites in the Basin. photography has been used to locate potential drilling sites in the Basin. The use of this technique is based upon the premise that fractures evident in surface sediments are often useful indicators of subsurface fracturing favorable for the accumulation of hydrocarbons. Buried fault traps, anticlines, and salt domes are frequently revealed by surface fault configurations or locally anomalous joint orientations. Moreover, since fractures are frequently conduits and collection sites for hydrocarbons, a concentration of surface fractures may indicate a potential productive reservoir at depth. productive reservoir at depth. Aerial photography allows fractures to be recognized and mapped in almost every type of terrain and soil cover. A photogeological study designed to aid in the location of specific prospects typically begins with a study of LANDSAT photos to spot large scale features. This is followed by a study of stereoscopic photo pairs and photomosaics of larger scale. For pinpointing drilling sites in such cases, the greatest weight is placed on the interpretations from stereoscopic photo pairs. geology, the techniques used in applying aerial photography as an exploration tool and finally the application of photogeology in identifying specific well sites in the Devonian Shales of the Appalachian Basin. Introduction Structures responsible for conventional hydrocarbon traps such as anticlines, fault closures, and salt domes are frequently indicated by surface fault configurations or locally anomalous joint orientations. Joint patterns are sometimes also useful in the diagnosis of stress forces that produce folds, wrench faults, etc. Furthermore, since fractures are frequently conduits for both hydrocarbons and metallic minerals, a concentration of surface fractures may sometimes indicate fracture networks that serve as the reservoirs for hydrocarbons at depth, or vein-type mineral lodes. This paper describes the use of aerial photographs to locate fractures, and subsequently to locate drilling sites in Erie County, Pennsylvania, where the traps in the Devonian shale and the underlying Pennsylvania, where the traps in the Devonian shale and the underlying sands are stratigraphic. In the shales, porosity for gas is provided mainly by intersecting networks of natural fractures into which gases migrate from the very impermeable shales. In a study such as this, it is important for the geologist to identify and map surface traces of fractures as accurately as possible because such fractures are remarkably ubiquitous. However, in some areas man-made artifacts, that are easily confused with fracture traces, are almost as ubiquitous as well. Careful analysis backed by field experience is essential to discriminate between the two; and field verification is recommended in the most detailed work. p. 51

AB  - ABSTRACT:The elastoviscoplastic behavior of saltrocks may be interpreted in terms of a number of different fundamental deformation mechanisms that act at different rates at different shear and normal stress levels. The paper presents a new approach to a constitutive law for these materials, recognising the complex behavior, and making distinctions between different types of yield criteria and viscous flow laws. An attempt is made to develop this behavior as an analogue to the behavior of rock at high temperatures and stresses, where viscous mechanisms became possible. It is empasised that an appreciation of the dominant deformation mechanisms acting at particular conditions will guide the form of macroscopic constitutive laws for non-saltrocks.INTRODUCTION:Understanding rock behavior at great depth and elevated temperature requires quantification of deformation processes which do not occur in ordinary conditions. Study of these time-dependent (creep) processes requires high temperature (T) and stress (σm¹) tests at slow strain rates (dE/dt). Shear stresses (r=(σ¹-σ³)/2) and pore pressures must also be controlled. It may be of practical interest to explore analogues which display similar mechanisms at lower T, σm¹, and r conditions. Salt and potash may be useful analogues in some conditions. Halite (NaCl) and sylvite (KC1) display different deformation processes depending on σm¹, T, and r, but in conditions accessible in the laboratory and the field (σm¹ <70MPa; r<40MPa; T<150ºC). Provided that it can be shown that mechanisms are similar, analogies may be developed to other rock types. The critical issues are that behavioral fields, activation energies, and mechanism transition points be quantified to permit comparisons and extrapolations; deformation maps (Frost and Ashby, 1982) are essential for this purpose. A behavioral model for saltrocks will be described and treated as an analogue to the behavior of rocks at great depth. Emphasis is on the effects of stress and strain rate on mechanisms in saltrocks. Saltrocks display most aspects of brittle viscous- ductile behavior at strain rates of d /dt=10-²-10-¹² S-¹: brittle yield and dilation at low σm, ideally elastoplastic and non-dilative behavior at high σm' transition from viscoelastic to viscoplastic creep as r rises, of steady-state cracking (with an-nealing), rate dependence of the yield criterion, and primary creep with recovery.YIELD BEHAVIOR:Elastoplastic (EP) yield is the conventional yield criterion (Y) of rock mechanics. Fig. 1 shows Brazilian and triaxial test data giving a curved criterion with these features: at low σ³, brittle behavior with dilatancy and debonding, small to failure, dependency of Y on σ3, UCS about 12 times To; at high σ3, cataclastic flow without σ3 dependence, dilatancy supression, crystal rupture; and, at intermediate confining stresses, transitional behavior. Typically, for halite, the transition to fully cataclastic plastic yield occurs at σ3= 10-20 MPa, σ1-σ3]EP≈ 35- 40 MPa, with rate effects. Consider a test at low σ3: if r creep will occur, but r>Y can be applied for short times before strain-weakening. Thus, Y is a lower bound, defined as the lowest τ for strain-weakening yield in any time.

AB  - ABSTRACTSurface Controlled Subsurface Safety Valve failure data from 14 North Sea fields have been collected and failure rates for the various valve types and makes calculated. Failure rates have been compared to well data in order to identify critical well parameters and give guidance to operators when selecting valves for new fields. Finally, models are developed for calculating well safety and production availabilities. Input to these models is failure rates, testing and maintenance routines, frequency of other well service operations etc. Output from the models is:- The proportion of the time the valve acts as a safety barrier, i.e. safety availability- The proportion of the time that the valve is causing production shutdown, i.e. production unavailabilityINTRODUCTIONMost people involved in production of oil and gas from high pressure reservoirs will probably agree that the Down Hole Safety Valve is one of the most important components for controlling blowout risk. In particular this is the case offshore where one platform may be producing from more than 30 wells. In such situations it is very important to be able to shut off the wells with a down hole device if a hazardous situation should arise on the platform. In spite of this importance, there are still endless arguments regarding what kind of safety valve to use, e.g. from which manufacturer, flapper or ball valve, or maybe to install two valves in series. No clear cut criteria for selecting valves for various types of fields and uses exists. The study documented this paper was aiming at recommending such criteria, based on an investigation of past safety valve performance in North Sea fields. In this area only surface Controlled Subsurface-Safety Valves (SCSSV) are used, and the study is therefore restricted to this type of valves.The selection criteria that were sought, should reflect both well safety and production availability. Disregarding one of these factors will inevitably result in suboptimal solutions. DATA COLLECTIONTo obtain a reasonably correct picture of past SCSSV performance, all major operators in the North Sea area were contacted, and asked to participate in the study by releasing their data regarding valve failure statistics and field parameters. Fortunately, most operators were willing to release their data, provided the information was published in a pooled manner. The information necessary was Valve type, make and dimensionsOperating timeNumber of failures and failure modesField data (e.g. reservoir type, pressure, temp., H2S and CO2 content, GOR, oil gravity) From the 10 operators supplying data from a total of 14 fields, it was possible to obtain a sufficient amount of data for the following valves Wire line Retrievable (WR) valves: - Otis DD, Otis DK, Otis DB, Otis QO- Baker BFX-Ol (Super "e") - Camco B-6- Folderol PATubing Retrievable (TR) valves: - Camco TRB-8FSRThis totaled more than 800 well years of operation, and in this period 412 failures were registered.

AB  - ABSTRACTA new testing technique allows surface monitoring of downhole pressures and temperatures, in real time, during an otherwise conventional drill stem test; the pressure and temperature data is measured at a point below the downhole test valve. This makes it possible, for the first time, to conduct the testing operation with optimum efficiency, according to the particular behaviour of the well being tested.The surface read-out capacity is achieved by using an electric wireline which can be latched on to a gauge located on top of the test tool. The, strain gauge type, pressure sensor used has an accuracy of ±0.04% of full scale (10,000 psi). and a resolution of 0.02 psi.The pressure and temperature data is available continuously, in real time, in the form of a print-out and a plot, in any co-ordinates. This data is also permanently recorded on magnetic tape. A computer which controls the data gathering operation, is also used for interpretation purposes.A description of the tools together with several case histories are given. INTRODUCTIONFor many years short time drill stem tests have been used to evaluate zones encountered while drilling exploratory wells and, less commonly, to quantify the potential of wells drilled into known reservoirs. The equipment used has evolved over the years, from the original packer and single shot downhole valves to the latest, relatively sophisticated annulus pressure controlled valves.The introduction of those annulus pressure controlled testing valves represented significant improvements in the safety and operational aspects of the testing procedure, but generally they still required retrieval of the test string to obtain the recorded downhole data. With a Full Bore testing valve it is possible to retrieve the downhole pressure and/or temperature recorders with 'slick? line, but this also involves considerable delay in the acquisition of the data.The present paper describes a technique which eliminates any delay between the generation of data downhole and its availability at surface.This new technique eliminates the necessity to pre-plan a drill stem test. Such 'pre-planning' is normally done essentially on the basis of rules of thumb, which stipulate shut-in times as a function of flow times. With a prolific well this can mean wasted rig time because wellbore pressure builds up close to or reaches reservoir pressure soon after shutting in. In these circumstances, a real time surface read-out of the downhole data would indicate early termination of the shut-in, with consequent savings of rig time.Conversely, many DST's of tighter zones often do not provide adequate information because shut-in time(s) were too short. With a surface read-out of the downhole data, in real time, every test can be engineered for maximum information thus avoiding costly retests or having to make major decisions with uncertain data.

AB  - The use of downhole Electrical Submersible Pumps (ESP) provides a means of producing oil reservoirs that are non-eruptive and requires artificial lift to produce the reservoirs. The maximum expected wellhead pressure (MEWHP) of these wells takes account of the ESP parameters and in some cases, for instance after a long shutdown, the MEWHP of an ESP well can be as much as five times greater than the maximum wellhead flowing pressure (MWFP). This creates a challenge for the design of surface facilities, as even though the reservoir pressure may be low, there exists the possibility for overpressure of the facilities by the ESPs. The design of the surface facilities therefore needs to account for possible overpressure from these pumps. High Integrity Pressure Protection Systems (HIPPS) provides an alternate protection to the use of traditional pressure relief systems in cases where the installation of these systems is not technically feasible or where their installation would result in a disproportionate cost to the project and possible inacceptable environmental impact with the multiplication of flare or vent systems. The traditional HIPPS design uses closure of a valve as the final element for isolating the overpressure source. This paper presents the results of a study that uses an ‘Electrical HIPPS’ system to directly isolate the electrical source to the ESPs thereby stopping the pumps and removing the overpressure source. The study demonstrates that an electrical HIPPS architecture can be used to protect the surface facilities from overpressure from the ESPs. The use of this design provides an overpressure protection system with a much faster reaction time, as valve closure time is no longer a limiting factor in stopping the source of overpressure. It further shows that a HIPPS design based on this architecture can achieve a HIPPS layer reliability equivalent to SIL 3, in low demand mode and with acceptable test period from an operational point of view. A case study is presented which illustrates the applicability and sensitivity of the HIPPS design to the protection of individual wells clusters versus protection of a production pipeline that has many clusters feeding to the system.

AB  - Abstract Abu Dhabi Oil Refining Company, Takreer has recently commissioned the Ruwais Refinery Expansion Project. The Grass Root refinery having capacity to process 417,000 BPSD (Barrels per Stream Day) of Murban crude. Commissioning & Startup is one of the most critical milestones and phase of projects in refinery. It is the last visible step of a project execution process. It moves the project from the "end of construction" to the "commercial operation" status. This paper focus the challenges associated with new refinery commissioning and start-up situations, an understanding of the tools and techniques that can be used to facilitate the effective planning, execution, control and management of these situations. The work process on a Refinery project involves basic engineering, detail engineering, procurement, construction & erection, precommissioning and startup. While each of these activities has its own importance but construction and adoption of successful precommissioning Strategy are the two crucial activities that determine a safe flawless startup. This paper address some the critical commissioing issue encountered while strating a grass root refinery and petrochemical complex.

AB  - SummaryOperational experience data from deepwater subsea blowout preventers (BOP's) used in the U.S. Gulf of Mexico (GOM) in 1997 and 1998 have been collected and analyzed to reveal BOP reliability problems. Results focus on rig downtime caused by BOP failures, criticality of failures in terms of ability to control a well kick, and BOP subsea test-time consumption. Results have been compared with corresponding results from previous BOP reliability studies carried out for other areas and periods. An overall conclusion is that there are no main differences in overall reliability of deepwater BOP's vs. BOP's operating in "normal" water depths, except for increased downtime caused by increased BOP handling time in deep waters.IntroductionFrom 1982 to 1999, the Foundation for Scientific and Industrial Research at the Norwegian Inst. of Technology (SINTEF) carried out several reliability studies of subsea BOP systems on behalf of various oil companies, the Norwegian Petroleum Directorate, and the Minerals Management Service (MMS). Studies were based on data from wells drilled in the North Sea, Brazilian waters and the GOM Outer Continental Shelf (OCS).Phase I to Phase V of the subsea BOP reliability studies were based on data from wells drilled in "shallow" Norwegian waters in the period 1978 to 1990. Studies were based on a total of 256 wells.1-9The Phase I Deepwater (DW) study was based on data from deepwater wells (water depths deeper than 1,312 ft) drilled in Brazilian waters and shallow Norwegian waters in the period 1992 to 1997. Of 144 wells examined, 100 were deepwater wells.10,11The Phase II DW study was based on experience from 83 deepwater wells drilled in the GOM OCS in 1997 and 1998.12A study concerning reliability of platform BOP's was completed in 1992.13 The study was based on data from 48 development wells drilled from three North Sea platforms.This paper focuses on results from Phase II DW. Results from Phase I DW studies serve as reference for comparison.The main objective of the Phase II DW study was to investigate and present deepwater subsea BOP reliability for GOM OCS rigs, and, further, to compare results with the reliability of subsea BOP's from other areas.The first part of the paper focuses on the data source and how data were analyzed. Thereafter, BOP failures, associated downtime, and criticality are presented and discussed. BOP subsea test time consumption is presented and discussed.Data for the Reliability StudyBOP Design.Fig. 1 shows a typical BOP used for deepwater drilling. The BOP has an 183/4-in. throughbore with rated working pressure of either 10,000 or 15,000 psi. It is stacked with two annular preventers and four ram-type preventers. The typical system has three or four choke/kill line outlets. Each outlet is connected to the choke or kill line through two redundant failsafe gate valves. Most subsea BOP's used for DW drilling are identical to subsea BOP's used for shallow waters. Some DW BOP's, however, are controlled by a multiplex control system to reduce the BOP activating time. Some DW BOP's include two blind shear rams (BSR's) to increase the probability of being able to cut the drillpipe and to seal off the well in case of a rig driftoff.In Phase II, DW reliability experience from 26 BOP's was collected and analyzed.Six of the 26 BOP's had only one annular preventer.One BOP had two shear rams.Most BOP's had both fixed and variable rams.Two BOP's had only variable bore rams (VBR's).One rig had only fixed rams.Some BOP's have a VBR as the lower pipe ram (LPR), while most prefer to have a fixed ram as the LPR.The number of choke and kill valves on each stack varied from four up to ten. Two of the BOP's had the lower choke or kill line outlet above the LPR; the remaining 24 had the lower outlet below the LPR. In May 1999 MMS issued a "Notice to Lessees and Operators" (NTL-99-G09), stating that the choke line lowermost outlet is not permissible below the lower ram, but a kill line is. Only three rigs had a multiplex control system; the remaining 23 had either a pilot control or a precharged pilot-control system. None of the rigs included in the study had an acoustic backup BOP control system.BOP Failure Data.Data regarding BOP failures and malfunctions were collected from 26 semisubmersible rigs and drillships for 15 different operators. Data were reviewed from 83 deepwater wells, spudded between July 1, 1997 and May 1, 1998. Actual water depth for the wells ranged from 1,335 to 6,725 ft. All relevant operators were asked to release data for the study, but a few did not submit any data.Main data sources for failure information were daily drilling reports (mostly in electronic formats, but some hardcopies) and BOP test reports.Additional information required for the study has been well-casing information, BOP stack configuration, BOP key maintenance procedure, and general rig information. This information came from daily drilling reports, well-casing reports, drilling contractors, oil companies, and public sources.BOP failures are observed mainly during function and pressure testing of the BOP and during normal drilling operation. Only failures observed during the BOP stump test prior to running the BOP, during running of the BOP, and when the BOP is on the wellhead, are regarded as BOP failures. Failures observed between wells during maintenance are not regarded as failures.All observed failures were fed into a database system tailored to keep track of BOP failure and maintenance information. All information related to BOP subsea testing were fed into the same database system.General Information.General information collected included key rig information; well information (water depth, well depth, spud date, BOP run date, etc.); casing information (mainly sizes and depths); and BOP equipment information.BOP-Failure Information.BOP-failure information collected included the incident date; equipment involved; a description of the failure (how it was observed, failure mode, etc.); and downtime associated with the failure.BOP-Test Information.BOP-test information for all subsea tests included test pressures, detailed test-time consumption, and description of the tests

AB  - SummaryAlthough the mathematical concept of "wavelet transform" was developed in the early part of the 20th century, it did not receive practical application until the 1980s. Wavelet transform is now used in a wide variety of applications in the areas of medicine, biology, and data compression, among others. A significant benefit provided by wavelet transform is its capability to provide two functions:Smoothing of the basic signal.Retention or even enhancement of the details.In data analysis, these characteristics allow the user to recognize hidden signals quickly. In well testing, these capabilities can enhance signals that can be masked by other events or by the data frequency itself. Because the derivative techniques currently used in well testing tend to smooth data and conceal certain events, the use of the wavelet transform to analyze the raw data could prove to be very valuable as a major step in enhancing the techniques of modern data analysis.This paper briefly reviews the application of the wavelet transform methodology to data analysis in general and shows why its application to well-testing data in particular is important. It also provides guidelines for the application of this technology to well testing.Several field examples are provided to demonstrate the application of the wavelet transform to well testing and to show how the qualitative and quantitative uses of the method determine wellbore anomalies, boundary effects, and other well-testing phenomena.ReviewA significant amount of information can be carried within one signal. By mathematically manipulating the raw signal, the hidden or masked information can be revealed. This mathematical manipulation is called transformation. The transform of a signal (i.e., a vector) is a new representation of that signal. A signal that has been "transformed" by any of the available mathematical transformations is the processed signal.There are many mathematical transformations that may be applied to a raw signal, the most popular of which are the Fourier transforms. In their raw format, most signals are time-domain signals, meaning that the signal is a function of time. In many cases, distinguishable pieces of information are hidden in the frequency content of the signal when viewing a signal in time domain (e.g., amplitude vs. time).The frequency spectrum of a signal includes the frequency components of that signal. A mathematical transform of the signal changes the signal into the frequency domain and, consequently, reveals hidden information carried by the signal.A mathematical transform is applied routinely to a signal to reveal the hidden information discussed above. There are numerous applications in which this transformation is used, not only in technical applications but also in daily life. Examples include analysis of electric light, car repair, and electrocardiography (ECG). An ECG signal gives the electric signature of the heart. Anomalies in the signal are hard to detect in the time domain; however, after transformation into the frequency domain, the anomalies become relatively easy to determine, thus leading to a correct diagnosis.Application of Signal Analysis to Well-Test Analysis Conventional well-test analysis of data uses a log-log plot of the pressure change vs. time. Logarithmic plotting is a very powerful technique because it maintains the relative shape of the major physical parameters affecting the performance of a well. Thus, an analyst may quickly identify the reservoir type and characteristics by using this technique. Maintenance of the shape of the data also allows an analyst to visually match the observed data to a theoretically developed model.1 Logarithmic plotting, however, smoothes data and may hide subtle effects of some other physical parameters.To overcome this problem, the derivative method was developed and used extensively.2 Theoretically, the derivative technique enhances subtle changes between data points and subsequently overcomes some of the problems associated with the log-log plotting. Three features, however, compromise its effectiveness.First, the logarithmic plotting technique is also used in the derivative technique, which may have some negative effect.Second, because the derivative between two neighboring points will cause a very noisy graph and may be counterproductive in practice, the derivative is taken over a window of data. One has to strike the right balance during this process. Too small a window will produce a noisy derivative plot, while too large a window will overly smooth the data and reduce the effectiveness of the plot.Third, as shown in Eq. 1, for an infinite-acting reservoir, the derivative is actually the product of time and the pressure derivative with respect to time. Although the use of the product of the derivative and time has some excellent justifications that we will not discuss here, it has the effect of stretching the plot and thus obscuring the effect of some of the well and reservoir effects.Equation 1The application of signal-analysis techniques to raw, unprocessed data to filter out noise and/or reach a better understanding of either the source or the path of a signal has been used in many fields. Similarly, the application of these techniques to raw, unprocessed pressure signals would help in the identification of some of the wellbore and reservoir anomalies that may be misinterpreted or even missed in conventional analyses. Surface or downhole valve shut-in, segregation of gas, liquid phases inside the wellbore, change of the fluid phase around the gauge, presence of boundaries, and change of flow regime may cause anomalies in a pressure- transient signal.

AB  - ABSTRACTFMC has developed and operated riserless light well intervention (RLWI) equipment in the North Sea since 2003. The development work started in 1999 and has resulted in a separate operating unit within FMC, FMC Production Systems FPS, that now operates RLWI systems onboard three vessels from the 2009 season. Long-term contracts are established with both StatoilHydro and BP, and additional work has been carried out in the spot market both on Norwegian and UK sector of the North Sea.The RLWI systems make it possible to perform wireline well interventions from mono-hull vessels, instead of using riser based systems that need to be operated from drilling rigs. The overall cost of the operations can therefore be reduced, and as a result, more subsea completed wells are intervened, and production rates and ultimate recovery can be improved.From the recent past, a gap(12-14 percent) in recovery from the fixed platforms relative to the subsea fields has emerged, even though the properties of the reservoirs are basically the same. To a large extent this gap is related to the high cost in subsea operations in general and well operations in particular. Experience, however, shows that efficient (i.e. low cost) well intervention solutions are of the utmost importance for increased field recovery as well.RLWI is one tool helping to close the recovery gap. RLWIs are steadily gaining industry acceptance since their introduction in 2003. This activity has significantly increased since 2005 in the North Sea, requiring at least two concurrent vessels for planned operations in 2010.RLWI operations are now common in shallow water up to 600m (2000ft), and a few operations in the Gulf of Mexico have been performed down to 900m. For open-hole logging, a demonstration down to 3000m has been performed with a similar solution. However, the current concept is not the ultimate technical solution worldwide, just the first step. Considerable efforts have to be made to improve the concept with respect to efficiency, weather sensitivity and - last but not least - deep-water compatibility. It is envisaged 3000m (10,000ft) water depth is well within reach.North Sea ExperienceAll traditional wireline tasks are performed from these vessels. There has been a gradual development into more complex downhole tasks as experience has been gained. From a humble start with mainly simple mechanical tasks, the operations suite today consists of the following: Data gathering (production logging tool, or PLT) Perforating/re-perforation Zone isolation (plug/straddle) Inspection/repair/installation of insert downhole safety valve (DHSV) Milling of short-scale bridges Camera runs: visual or X-ray Well killing operation Pumping operations/scale treatments Selective tracer injection or sampling Change-out of gas lift valves Sleeve operations - downhole instrumentation and control systems (DIACS) valves Change-out of subsea trees Plugging and abandoning (P&A) operations of subsea wells.As a typical example of the results obtained from these operations, the following summary of a scale milling job is illustrative: Scale milling on WL tractor (breakthrough for advanced RLWI operations)

AB  - SummaryWe performed acoustic measurements in a time-lapse sequence in scaled laboratory tests. The advantage of time-lapse measurements is that the fracture response can be separated from the background signal. As a consequence, not only can the hydraulic fracture be detected, but its shape and geometry can be measured during its growth. This application requires the combined information of both compressional- and shear-wave measurements. We apply this technique to propagation, flowback tests, and reopening of hydraulic fractures.Acoustic waves excite diffractions at the fracture tip. These diffractions are used to locate and to characterize the fracture tip. The acoustic measurements indicate that we can distinguish between a dry tip and the fluid front of the fracture.Shadowing of shear-wave transmissions allows estimation of the moment of fracture initiation. The width profile of the fracture is determined with compressional-transmission measurements. This application is based on the fact that the attenuation and time delay of compressional transmissions are proportional to the fracture width. Analysis of a flowback test shows that the fracture closed at the wellbore but remained open farther away from the wellbore.IntroductionDesign of hydraulic fractures is based on assumptions about the fracture geometry and on a description of the target formation. Fracture behavior in subsurface formations is not only a complicated process, but there is often a lack of sufficient formation data. Therefore, we studied the fundamental fracture process in laboratory tests in conjunction with novel measurements of the fracture geometry using active acoustics.Medlin and Massé1 pioneered acoustic monitoring of hydraulic-fracture growth in laboratory tests. They showed the possibility of measuring fracture length by detecting transmission losses of compressional waves. On the basis of their results, we decided to build a state-of-the-art acoustic-monitoring system in our triaxial load frame.2,3 These experiments resulted in the first detection of strong compressional diffractions scattered from the perimeter of the fracture.2 We used arrival time of the diffraction to estimate fracture length.2,3 We recently extended the method to determine fracture width3,4 and improved the setup to detect shear waves that contain useful information on fracture closure and reopening.3,5The measurements proved to be extremely valuable in the laboratory, and they are also promising for determining the dimensions of fractures in the field. As yet, only a small number of field treatments have been combined with active acoustic measurements, and these have been only partly successful because of the complex acquisition geometry and conditions at depth. Both differential vertical-seismic-profiling (VSP) experiments6-8 and crosswell experiments9-11 have shown the possibility of monitoring fracture propagation by use of the phenomenon of shear-wave shadowing. When propagation of the shear wave is disturbed by creation of a hydraulic fracture, transmission of the shear wave is lost or shadowed because shear waves cannot propagate through fluid. Hence, shear-wave shadowing indicates that the fracture intervenes the ray path from source to receiver. Field tests were used in this way to estimate the global fracture geometry. Active measurements can also be used to determine small-scale details of fractures near the borehole. Recently, advances in sonic tools with dipole sources operating at low frequency have shown that it is possible to monitor fractures from the same borehole.12The advantage of acoustic monitoring in the laboratory instead of in the field is the flexibility to try various acquisition geometries for relatively low cost. Laboratory experiments provide a unique opportunity to gain information about the acoustic data that can be acquired and their application.The first section of this paper describes the experimental setup. The second section discusses the observations of acoustic diffractions and their relation to the fracture tip. We use these diffractions to locate the position of the fracture tip. Estimation of fracture size by use of the direct diffractions allows prediction of the arrival time of more complicated events, including those related to surface waves along the fracture. With this arrival-time prediction, we can interpret the various events that have been measured in the laboratory. In addition, we show that the acoustic diffraction measurements can distinguish between migration of the fluid front and the dry tip.The third section of the paper discusses observations and applications of transmission measurements. Shadowing of shear-wave transmissions allows us to determine the moment of fracture initiation. Compressional waves are partially transmitted. We propose a waveform fitting procedure and show that accurate and reliable estimates of fracture width can be obtained. By combining several transmission measurements of different source/receiver combinations, we reconstruct the full fracture width profile during propagation and closure.Experimental SetupWeijers13 gives a detailed description of the experimental setup for the fracture experiments, and Savic2 and Groenenboom3 describe the acoustic part. We limit ourselves to those parts of the experimental setup that are necessary to understand the data we show in this paper.A 0.3-m cubic block is stressed in a true-triaxial-compression machine. The load frame consists of three perpendicular compression systems, each of which can independently deliver a maximum force of 3500 kN (Fig. 1). For this block size, the maximum pressure that can be imposed on each side is 40 MPa, which corresponds to the effective in-situ stress at a depth of approximately 3000 m. Because the sample is not supported at the ribs, it is impossible to apply pore pressure to the rock.

AB  - Abstract In ZADCO's giant offshore oilfield, the Surface-Controlled Downhole Safety Valve (SC-DHSV) system of some oil producers failed to operate. Thorough investigation revealed that SC-DHSV landing nipple sealbore damage was the root cause of failure. The failed SC-DHSVs were temporarily replaced with A-3 Storm Choke Valves. The conventional solution to restore the integrity of a failed SC-DHSV was the workover. However, efforts were made in identifying a viable rigless solution by thoroughly reviewing the available options and as an alternative, special oversized B-Type seals were chosen to substitute the existing conventional V-Type packings that failed to seal in said valves. To ensure safe field implementation, a risk assessment was conducted followed by successful yard testing. Field implementation was successfully completed by utilizing conventional slickline unit which saved significant time and cost. A standard SC-DHSV was redressed with the oversized B-Type seals, set in the landing nipple and functioned normally. The redressed SC-DHSVs were routinely tested during the following year with no concern reported. The successful implementation was documented and is recommended for future use in similar cases. Keywords: Well integrity, Downhole Safety Valve (DHSV) System, DHSV Landing Nipple Polished Sealbore Area, Risk Assessment, Workover, Rigless Application. Introduction Safe extraction of hydrocarbons is the ultimate goal for all operating companies. Protection against equipment failures and preparedness for worst case scenarios is mandatory. Safety devices in the oil and gas industry are widespread and require special attention to maintain their integrity and ensure their durability for the lifecycle of an asset. A key safety device in oil wells is the downhole safety valve which protects against abnormal flow conditions. Downhole safety valves (DHSVs) are failsafe, surface controlled, and remotely operated. They sense any abnormal conditions and shut down instantly to prevent any uncontrolled well flow. In offshore locations, DHSVs gain additional importance in protecting personnel, environment, and company assets in the event of catastrophic failure of critical surface safety equipment due to fire, explosions, ship collision etc. Hence, the integrity of a DHSV is considered of a paramount important in oil fields. The DHSVs are of different kinds and make, however their features and functionality must be in accordance with international standards and local regulations. Wireline conveyed Surface-Controlled DHSVs are very common in the region and proven to be durable. However they require scheduled servicing and testing to ensure their effectiveness. DHSVs are run and set inside the landing nipple profile located in the production string at a depth below seabed level. The landing nipple has upper and lower polished bores that seal against the DHSV packing. The device is connected to the surface control panel via ¼?? control line filled with hydraulic oil. The surface control system senses abnormalities in operating conditions and hydraulically communicates with the DHSV for closure and opening as set by the operator and particularly the emergency shutdown (ESD) commands.

AB  - An adequate understanding of digital dip processing procedures is important if the analyst expects to acquire dip arrow plots which subsequently allow optimum geological analysis. Assuming that wellsite considerations, previously discussed in Part II of this series, were carried out with acceptable standards, the analyst should next consider the data processing step. Wellsite processing, also discussed in the previous article, is commonly a less sophisticated, more user-friendly computation which facilitates not only speed but also accommodates the relative inexperience of the logging engineer. It is important that the consumer recognize this. Centralized computer processing centers, staffed with appropriately trained personnel, provide capability for more sophisticated dip processing methods. When the purpose of the survey is known, specific input parameters and auxiliary programs can be maximized to refine dip results. Resultant dip arrow plots can be more prophetic when the analyst makes more effective use of the processing step.

AB  - SummaryThe platform PETROBRAS 25 (P-25) is operating at Albacora field, located at the northeast portion of Campos Basin, offshore Brazil, about I 10 Km from the coast, in a water depth that varies from 230 to 1600 m. This unit, originally a drilling platform, was converted into a production floating system with process capacity of 100,000 bpd of oil and 3,000,000 m3/d of gas, P-25 is moored in a water depth of 520 m, receiving the production from 13 satellite wells and 2 diverless subsea production manifolds (MSPDL-I e MSPDL-2), with 8 wells each. These 2 manifolds were considered the deepest in the world at that time, installed in 500 and 620 m, and are improved with features like multiplex control pod and vertical connection. To reach this important mark, a lot of things have been done, including operational procedures to prevent hydrate formation. Nevertheless, seven months after the unit started producing, a total blockage in two wells in each manifold caused by hydrates occurred. The purpose of this paper is to describe how hydrate formation took place and the actions taken to unblock the manifold and restore the production. IntroductionHistorically, the hydrate formation in petroleum multiphase flow lines occurs after a shutdown or when the well went on stream. One classic example is, after an emergency shutdown in the unit, the down-hole safety valve (DHSV) of the well closes. Then could occur some gas segregation right down the DHSV and some free water right over it. When the well is open, the contact gas-water on a high pressure and low temperature ambient occurs around the DHSV, creating conditions to hydrate formation and, as a consequence, the production line is plugged. To avoid hydrate formation in P-25, the following procedure was adopted: Before open any well, we circulated diesel on the wellhead, flowing by the gas-lift line and keeping WI, W2 and XOV valves open. We calculated the gas-lift and production lines volume and filled them with diesel. Whenever it was possible, we launched a low-density foam pig, lead by the diesel flow, cleaning completely the lines. Then, we equalized the pressure over the DHSV valve, pumping diesel and keeping the MI valve open and WI valve closed, When, there was a diesel injection right through the DHSV, we pressurize the hydraulic line to open this valve. After the confirmation of the DHSV opening, we put the well on stream.Problem DetectionThe start-up of the wells AB-43 (MSPDL I) and AB-38 (MSPDL2) follows the procedure that was described before, with some changes, because these wells are connected to the subsea production manifolds. As we can see in the P-25 submarine system diagram (figure I), connecting each manifold to the platform, there are a main production line (10 in at MSPDL-I and 8 in at MSPDL-2), a main gas-lift injection line (4 in for both manifolds), a test production line (4 in for both manifolds) and a service line (8 in for both manifolds) used to individual measurement of the gas-lift injection.

AB  - SummaryAlthough the mathematical concept of "wavelet transform" was developed in the early part of the 20th century, it did not receive practical application until the 80's. Wavelet Transform is now used in a wide variety of applications in the areas of medicine, biology, data compression, etc. A significant benefit provided by Wavelet Transform is its capability to provide two functions: smoothing of the basic signal, and retention or even enhancement of the details. In data analysis, these characteristics allow the user to quickly recognize hidden signals. In well testing, these capabilities would enhance signals that can be masked by other events or by the data frequency itself. Since the derivative techniques currently used in well testing tend to smooth data and conceal certain events, the use of the wavelet transform to analyze the raw data could prove to be very valuable as a major step in enhancing the techniques of modern analysis of data.This paper will very briefly review application of the wavelet transform methodology to data analysis in general and will show why its application to well testing data in particular is important. It will also provide guidelines for application of this technology to well testing.Several field examples are provided to demonstrate the application of the wavelet transform to well testing and how the qualitative and quantitative use of the method determines wellbore anomalies, boundary effects, and other well testing phenomena.ReviewWithin a signal a significant amount of information may be carried. By mathematically manipulating the raw signal, the hidden or masked information may be revealed. This mathematical manipulation is called transformation. The transform of a signal (i.e. a vector) is a new representation of that signal. A signal that has been "transformed" by any of the available mathematical transformations is the processed signal.There are many mathematical transformations that may be applied to a raw signal, the most popular of which are the Fourier transforms. In their raw format, most signals are time-domain signals, meaning that the signal is a function of time. In many cases, distinguishable pieces of information are hidden in the frequency content of the signal when viewing a signal in time domain (e.g. amplitude versus time).The frequency spectrum of a signal is the frequency components of that signal. A mathematical transform of the signal changes the signal into the frequency domain and consequently reveals hidden information carried by the signal. A mathematical transform is applied routinely to signal to reveal the hidden information discussed above. There are numerous applications where this transformation is used, not only in technical applications but also in daily life. Examples include analysis of electric light, car repair and in electrocardiography (ECG). An ECG signal gives the electric signature of the heart. Anomalies in the signal are hard to detect in the time domain. However, after transformation into the frequency domain, the anomalies become relatively easy to determine, thus leading to a correct diagnosis.

AB  - ABSTRACT Observation of the spatial evolution of turbulent structures in the surf zone is presented through quantitative measurements of the internal flow fields of spilling waves propagating on a 1:20 slope by Particle Image Velocimetry (PIV). The global ensemble-averaged flow method was employed for turbulence decomposition by repeating the same experiment 25 times in each field of view (FOV). Seven FOV were integrated to represent the global results, which covers the breaking wave from the outer to the inner surf zones. Results show that a relatively large turbulent motion is initially organized in the crest of the breaking wave in the bore-established region. As the wave crest passes, this turbulent structure will then stretch downward to the lower interior region of the water column. Turbulent convection and diffusion terms were estimated. It is found that the convection transport is very significant in spreading the turbulent structure from the wave crest to the trough region. INTRODUCTION The hydrodynamics of breaking waves in the surf zone have been an important subject for coastal and environmental engineering. Detailed reviews on hydrodynamics in the surf zone can be found in Peregrine (1983), Battjes (1988) and Christensen et al. (2002). Flow visualization is a powerful technique with which to experimentally investigate qualitative flow structures of wave breaking. For instance, Nadaoka et al. (1989) found the generation of oblique descending eddies under breaking waves by this technique. Lin and Hwung (1992) employed a fluorescent dye illuminated by an ultraviolet lamp to exhibit the motion of the surface roller, the bubble-mixing process, and the vortex stretching of plunging breakers. Additionally, experimental studies providing quantitative details have been carried out for decades. Svendsen et al. (1978) focused on the variation of surface profiles using a wave-gauge technique.

AB  - Abstract Description RasGas Company Limited ("RasGas??) employs a Facility Integrity Management System (FIMS) whose primary objective is to create a frame work system to maintain the physical and functional integrity of RasGas critical assets. Programme design starts with grouping equipment by programmes aligned with equipment classes such as structures, pipelines and machinery. Equipment is prioritised by determining its criticality to operations based on health, safety, environment (HSE) and business consequences. Risk-based plans, the so called equipment strategies, are developed to mitigate risks and maintain the desired level of integrity and reliability. These equipment strategy activities are then built into an overall Integrity Programme that includes objectives, roles and responsibilities and practices to ensure operational integrity through the operating life of the equipment. This paper will explain the various aspects and objectives of the system, in particular the benefits of having such a framework in place, managing risk-based inspections, early risk identification, the continuous improvement cycle through data analysis and risk screening non-performed preventive maintenance activities. The Facility Integrity Management System within RasGas would be described with the challenges faced and the lessons learnt during implementation. Challenges in the programme design, development and implementation will be highlighted as well as the strategies and decisions made to overcome these. Particular focus will be given to learnings in the development, implementation and sustainment of equipment strategies, early risk identification and system management.

AB  - Abstract Partial Stroke Testing was developed to assist in the management of the performance of safety critical ON/OFF valves. The original systems were developed over 2 decades ago and initially PST was just used to demonstrate that the valve can move off its seat. This was considered acceptable as a means of demonstrating safety valve performance. Systems used for this purpose were generally mechanical jammers. These jammers would take the form of snail cams attached to the valve stem, end stops on the actuator or other similar methods. These were used as there was concern that the valve may close during testing and therefore the mechanical jammer makes it impossible for the valve to close if used correctly. There was no diagnostic capability beyond the operator watching the valve move. As instrumentation advanced techniques used for control valves were adapted for PST purposes and valve positioners became a common method for PST. The main advantage of these systems was that certain parameters could be measured to control the PST and gain data relating to performance. However, the drawbacks were that additional equipment was required and pneumatic systems need to be changed to accommodate them. Add to that a now increased risk of spurious trips and the roll out of this technology had limitations. Now as we move into the era of Industry 4.0, as described by Marr, 2018 and analytics the industry is moving again to see how valve performance can be better quantified and how condition monitoring can be used to aid in the prediction of failures and facilitate predictive maintenance. This has led to the development of PST systems that have analytics based on position type data combined with the reliability and simplicity of mechanical jammers.

AB  - This article, written by Assistant Technology Editor Karen Bybee, contains highlights of paper SPE 113829, "Improving Well Safety and Maximizing Reserves Using an Innovative Surface- Controlled Subsurface Safety Valve (SC-SSSV)," by Francois Millet, SPE, Harve Petit, and Gery Wallez, Geoservices Equipment, and Philippe LaLanne, Alain Ducasse, and Emile Barzu, Total E&P France, originally prepared for the 2008 SPE Annual Technical Conference and Exhibition, Denver, 21-24 September. The paper has not been peer reviewed. A common cause of failure of surface-controlled subsurface safety valves (SCSSSVs) is a defect in the downhole hydraulic line that controls the valve from the surface. Such a failure generates production losses and requires the intervention of a costly workover rig. To alleviate this type of situation, a system has been developed in which the physical control line has been replaced by a communication system based on electromagnetic (EM) waves. The surface emitter continuously sends a signal to the SCSSSV. Both are designed to be fail-safe. Introduction Lacq field was developed from 1951 to 1957, while solving metallurgical constraints caused by the 15% H2S and 10% CO2 in its gas composition. Nearby, three other fields produce the same long and narrow reservoir and started production in late 1967. From 1968 to 1982, gas production reached approximately 33×106 m3/d, the production from the four fields being centralized at the Lacq treatment plant. These fields are now at the end of their life. The last well was drilled at the end of 1990. Since 1957, well pressures have dropped from 70 MPa to as low as 2 MPa. Unstable water production started in the early 1980s on some wells in the Meillon and Saint Faust fields, causing high operating costs because of water-disposal problems. Furthermore, the normally open velocity and ambient valves used on some wells are no longer acceptable because unstable flowing conditions do not allow accurate and repetitive closure. To extend the life of the wells and maximize the recovery factor, Total E&P France has been looking for a solution to replace subsurface-controlled safety valves (SSCSVs) and nonfunctioning SCSSSVs with new SCSSSVs without the need for a work-over. One solution is surfactant injection at the reservoir level. In this case, the challenge is to free the available nipple and set an injection device in the nipple, again without any work-over or wellhead modification. Avoiding Workover There currently are two types of safety systems being used. The SSCSVs are wireline retrievable (WR) and are calibrated well by well according to the latest production conditions. They are less and less compliant with safety regulations. The SCSSSVs are fail-safe production-rate independent, and testable from the surface whether they are tubing retrievable (TR) or WR.

AB  - Abstract Three hydraulically actuated isolation valves are able to completely isolate flow from a producing well to prevent uncontrolled flow; these are the PWV (Production Wing Valve), PMV (Production Master Valve) and the SSSV (Subsurface Safety Valve). As part of the drive for continued improvement in well safety, more prescriptive well integrity guidelines have been issued by the Oil and Gas UK. It is now recommended to test the safety critical isolation valves every six months unless reliability findings specific to the asset, valve type or location specify a different testing frequency. A documented rationale is therefore, required to either justify the current lower frequency of testing or accept the recommended frequency which could incur significant additional deferment and testing costs. This paper outlines a novel method for quantifying risk using a Reliability Based Model (RBM). Actual data on valves' integrity and status, sourced from an electronic well integrity database, was used in the RBM to determine the probability that the valves will operate on demand. The availability of the valves was determined and quantitatively linked to a testing frequency that will ensure the reliability standards are met. Using a calibrated risk graph, the RBM assumed a SIL 3 (a high target level of risk reduction) for an offshore platform well; equivalent to achieving a target availability in the range of 99.9 - 99.99%. The optimal testing programme was based on achieving a low SIL 3 rating due to the slow progression rate of the failures identified. The RBM showed that only 25% of the wells studied required testing every 6 months. This demonstrates that by utilising specific asset data as outlined in the latest OGUK requirements, a more representative testing frequency can be determined which can potentially minimise deferment and maintenance costs.

AB  - AbstractThis paper presents the methodology and results from a major research project on well completion equipment reliability. Historical data were collected and analysed from a large number of installations represented by 17 participating oil companies. The data were analysed using a purpose designed software package for reliability analysis (CERED). A standardized reliability data collection format was defined for the most critical items of downhole completions and implemented in this software package. Generic and detailed reliability data are presented for entire completions as well as specific items, such as tubing, annulus safety systems, electrical submersible pumps and downhole permanent gauge systems. The paper also discusses the potential benefit of using reliability data as a decision basis, with consideration of limitations in data quality. The database established in this project represents nearly 800 completion equipment failures covering some 6600 well years of operation. A separate database is established and maintained by SINTEF on Surface Controlled Subsurface Safety Valves (SCSSV). The paper also describes some long term trends in SCSSV reliability extracted from this database which now holds information on some 1400 failures. The latest update of this database was completed and reported in February 1992 as an integral part of the well completion study. The cooperation with the participating oil companies and the major completion equipment manufacturers was instrumental in obtaining useful results in the study and is described in detail in the paper. IntroductionThe Ekofisk Bravo blowout in the Norwegian sector of the North Sea in April 1977 triggered a major research program into offshore safety in Norway, and was the direct reason for SINTEFs involvement in reliability studies of SCSSVS. From this point, these studies have been updated and expanded regularly, and the latest results are reported in IV. More recently, the scope of these studies was expanded to include also data on other well completion equipment /2/. The objective of these studies has been to collect, analyze and process reliability data for vital completion equipment. The reliability data serve as a valuable decision basis for the oil companies, but also provides a unique source of feedback on performance for the downhole equipment manufacturers. Collection of the reliability data has been possible only through close cooperation between the oil companies, manufacturers and SINTEF. The majority of data has been collected by staff members from the oil companies themselves using purpose made software and/or questionnaires. SINTEFs role has mainly been within software development, database implementation, quality assurance of data, manufacturer cooperation and processing of the reliability data. Use of dedicated software has been instrumental in achieving useful results from the studies. P. 401^

AB  - AbstractWe present a numerical method for the simulation of misci- ble and immiscible multiphase flow in porous media, with emphasis on the advection-dominated case. A fractional flow formulation is adopted, resulting in a "pressure" equa- tion and a "saturation" equation. The key idea of the pro- posed methodology is a multiple scale decomposition of the variable of interest into resolved and unresolved scales. This acknowledges the presence of fine scales which can- not be captured by any grid, but whose influence on the coarse scales is not negligible. The multiscale approach leads to a stabilized finite element formulation, which pre- vents global spurious oscillations of the numerical solution without introducing excessive dissipation. The method is further improved by incorporating a novel shock-capturing technique based on a nonlinear dissipation mechanism pro- portional to the absolute value of the subscales. We be- lieve this approach is entirely new in the context of flow in porous media. Numerical simulations of tracer injection (miscible flow) and waterflood (immiscible flow) are presented. The proposed subgrid scale method with shock- capturing shows exceptional performance in all test cases studied. These test cases illustrate the potential and appli- cability of the proposed formulation for solving multiphase compositional flows in porous media.IntroductionThe study of multiphase flow and multicomponent trans- port in porous and fractured media is crucial in assessing many processes relevant for improved oil recovery, such as tracer injection and flooding by water alternating gas. Quantitative prediction of these processes involves several modeling steps, shown in Figure 1.There are many difficulties associated with the correct conceptualization and mathematical formulation of the problem, due to scarcity of data and the complexity of the physical processes governing flow of several phases through a porous medium. Under certain assumptions, the field-scale mathematical problem can be expressed as a set of partial differential equations with the appropriate bound- ary conditions, and a set of algebraic equations providing closure. In all real cases, the mathematical problem needs to be solved numerically because the nonlinearity of the equations, presence of heterogeneities and fractures, com- plex geometries and time-dependent boundary conditions rule out analytical solutions.

AB  - Abstract This paper describes the general procedure and analysis of an oil well pressure transient test method in which a liquid that is miscible with reservoir oil is injected from the surface at constant rate.  Injection significantly reduces surface production test separation and rate measurement equipment requirements, and flaring, thereby reducing testing costs, and safety and environmental risks.  Injection of liquid provides for rate control to a precision difficult to attain during production, and although not strictly necessary, allows for a constant rate condition to be practically attained, potentially eliminating a time consuming shut-in and associated test duration and costs.  Drilling non-aqueous fluid base oil is a viable miscible injection fluid.  A well pressure model is developed that includes the effect of the viscosity difference between injected fluid and reservoir oil.  The temperature effect on viscosity is also considered. The model indicates that the duration of the viscosity effect may be short under practical conditions, and is controlled by injection rate.  Reservoir parameters estimated from the injection test are identical to those estimated with single-phase production pressure transient tests.  A reservoir oil PVT sample must be obtained independently, prior to injection.  Conventional pressure transient analysis applications may be used to analyze injection pressure transient data. Introduction This study originated from the desire to obtain reservoir permeability estimates as part of the exploration and delineation of an offshore basin in which the typical play is composed of stacked, fluvial sand reservoirs, forming three-way closures against trapping faults. A method is desired to assess the productivity of as many of the stacked oil bearing intervals as may be discovered in many or all exploration and delineation wells in the drilling program.  The success of future development depends on the exploitation of numerous small, vertically and laterally isolated reservoirs.  Evaluation of the productivity of many hydrocarbon intervals allows the estimation of the local distribution of reservoir productivity in various regions of the basin. Reservoir productivity estimates from production testing are more reliable than that from wireline flow testing and from core analysis, however the disproportionate costs associated with production testing, related to rig time and surface test equipment rental, discourages liberal use of this method.  Production testing also carries safety and environmental risks, particularly from flaring.  A flow test method that minimizes test duration, and eliminates the need for surface test equipment, is highly desired.

AB  - Summary Log-log superposition-time derivative plots are used to identify flow regimes in well tests with variable rate. The use of superposition time adjusts for the effect of the prior rate history, and (under some conditions) shows what the transient would have looked like if the test had been performed at a constant rate. In this report, I show that if these plots are used to interpret shut-in transients from diagnostic fracture-injection tests (DFITs), the superposition-time derivative has an upward deflection that does not represent actual reservoir or transient behavior. I review mathematical properties of the superposition-time derivative. I derive equations for the pressure transient in a simplified model DFIT in which closure does not occur. I show that the onset of late-time impulse flow is controlled by injection volume and formation, wellbore, and fracture properties, not the duration of injection (as implied by the definition of superposition time). Log-log superposition-time derivative plots of DFITs exhibit a slope of 3/2 at intermediate time. However, pressure change never scales with a 3/2 power of time. One form of the G-function superficially resembles a superposition-time function constructed by summing constant-rate solutions with 3/2 power scaling. However, this is not a mathematically or physically valid interpretation. The 3/2 power arises from a spatial integration of the Carter leakoff solution. There is not a mathematical, physical, or practical justification for plotting DFIT pressure-time data in a way that creates a 3/2 slope. I conclude by providing a field example and practical recommendations for DFIT interpretation.

AB  - ABSTRACT: Oil and gas wellbores experience a number of phases and scenarios during their lifespan. Drilling, completion, production and abandonment imply significant changes in the mechanical behavior of the well and its surrounding rock formation. Stress state and temperature changes are even more significant in Pre-salt wellbores since the creep behavior inherent to the salt rocks is strongly influenced by these state variables. This work presents a comprehensive Pre-salt wellbore integrity analysis addressing key phases of the well lifespan. Preventing casing from plastic deformations is recommended. The analyses were carried out with an in-house finite element simulator, GeoFlux3D, and have highlighted the wellbore casing sensitivity to the internal pressure and to the channels in the cement sheath. Plastic deformation has not been detected; however, the full evacuation periods and the cement channel affect negatively the casing integrity by triggering severe stress changes and non-uniformities, respectively. Therefore, proper definition of the loading and geometry scenarios to which Pre-salt wellbores are subjected is fundamental for reliable integrity predictions.1. INTRODUCTIONOil and gas wellbores experience a number of phases and scenarios during their lifespan. Drilling, completion, production and abandonment imply significant changes in the mechanical behavior of the well and its surrounding rock formation. Over the operational time, full evacuation maintenance periods occur, during which the internal pressure in the casing is drastically reduced. Moreover, the flow of fluids at different temperatures produces thermal processes through the casing (liner, overlap and pipes) that lead to a temperature rise in the salt formation. The stress state and temperature changes are even more relevant in Pre-salt wellbores since the creep behavior inherent to the salt rocks is strongly influenced by these two state variables.This work presents a comprehensive Pre-salt wellbore application addressing key stages of the well lifespan. A synthetic (but representative) wellbore model is adopted as object of study to simulate borehole drilling, liner running (installation of the outer casing), overlap running (installation of the inner casing) and full evacuation periods. It is assumed that both casing running’s are simultaneously followed the cementation of the corresponding drifts or annular spaces. The analyses are carried out with an in-house thermo-hydromechanical (THM) finite element simulator, GeoFlux3D (Quevedo, 2012). This tool holds a number of capabilities of interest for wellbore integrity analysis, including procedures to simulate borehole drilling, casing running, salt creep and non-uniform loading schemes. Axisymmetric, 2D and 3D models are supported.

AB  - This paper is a description of the dynamically positioned drilling ship, Glomar Challenger, referring to novel and unusual practices which should be of interest to marine and petroleum industries. Even today a seagoing ship with a 1 42-ft derrick is an oddity, although such derricks have been used in this capacity for over ten years. Probably the most noteworthy technological advance of this ship is found in the dynamic positioning system. To be able to hold a fixed position steadily—and within 1 00 ft of that position—and to be able to maintain position and orient the ship throughout the compass azimuths makes exciting work and oceanic exploration quite practical. The ship itself is a proven combination of marine and petroleum technologies aided by a power plant originally developed for the locomotive and petroleum industries. The aerospace industry has contributed satellite navigation and acoustic position-sensing systems. In total, the Glomar Challenger represents a practical and workable combination of industries, proven in service by the drilling to date of more than 20 core holes in the deepest parts of the North and South Atlantic Oceans. In four months of operation there has been no lost time due to weather or malfunctioning of the positioning system while drilling.

AB  - ABSTRACT This paper describes the reliability and operating history of the UKCS Block 30/24 floating production facility. This multi-field operation utilises a variety of production technologies including a floating production facility (FPF), a tanker loading system, subsea wells and manifolds, with gas lift and water injection. The overall performance of the production system is derived from the combined efficiencies of each of these components. The interaction of systems will be described along with a review of the performance monitoring methods used to ensure maximum system efficiency and uptime.INTRODUCTION UK Block 30/24 is located 200 miles offshore in the central sector of the North Sea. Three separate fields, (Argyll, Duncan and Innes) are curently on production from this block. The Argyll field was the first oil-field in the UK Continental Shelf to be brought on production. The semi-submersible drilling rig "Transworld 58" (TW58) was converted- to the industry's first FPF and production was started vi a subsea wells on 11 June 1975. Crude processed by the TW58 was exported via a catenary anchor leg moored (CALM) buoy and shuttle tankers.In late 1980, the Duncan field was discovered four miles to the west of Argyll. The Duncan fie1d was developed by installing a subsea manifold between the Duncan and Argyll fields, connecting four Duncan field producing wells to the manifold by subsea flowlines and transporting the combined production stream by a subsea pipe1ine to the TW58. The requirement for waterflooding to maintain reservoir pressure led to the replacement of the TW58 by another floating production facility, the "Deepsea Pioneer" (DSP). This unit had a waterflooding plant for Duncan and a gas lift plant to sustain Argyll production. The DSP replaced the TW58 in October 1984.In November 1985, the 1W58 commenced production from the Innes field situated 8 miles to the north, of Argyll. The crude oil was exported through the Argyll CALM buoy and shuttle tankers. The Innes field proved to be of limited extent, unable to support a stand alone facility, so the two Innes wells were tied back to the Deepsea Pioneer eliminating the need for the TW58. The tieback work was successfully completed in December 1986. The physical arrangement of the production system on Block 30/24 at the present time is shown in Figure 1. Twelve subsea production wells from three different fields, all with differing fluid characteristics, are routed back to a central manifold, some via individual flowlines, others via remote manifolds and feeder flowlines. Separation/stabilization facilities are housed on a single floating production facility which also supports gas lift and water injection plants. The stabilized crude continues to be exported via a CALM buoy and shuttle tankers.The equipment and techniques in use on Block 30/24 are the result of experience gained and technologies developed in more than 12 years of operating floating production systems in the harsh North Sea environment.

AB  - AbstractThis paper presents a state-of-the art review of the design options for subsea flowlines and production equipment for high-pressure service considering the High Integrity Pressure Protection System (HIPPS). Industry is finding prospects requiring High Pressure High Temperature (HPHT) equipment as oil and gas development extend into deeper offshore reservoirs. To develop these fields as subsea tiebacks, the design of flowlines and risers for HPHT conditions often becomes technically challenging or cost prohibitive.One of the options is to use a HIPPS system to allow the use of a lower-pressure rated flowline compared to the wellhead and tree equipment. However, it may not be obvious whether HIPPS is cost-effective, practical or operationally acceptable. Design issues for evaluating HIPPS include: field architecture, offset distance, line size, materials, pressure rating of the system components, length and pressure rating of "fortified zones", type of control system, system reliability, dynamic pressure rise resulting from a blockage and installed cost. Another fundamental issue is "Why are land-based HIPPS systems widespread and generally accepted in the industry, but not used as yet subsea?"For selected field architectures, the impact of using HIPPS will be illustrated with respect to these design issues. These design case studies will provide guidelines as to which combination of architectures and design parameters will be most suitable for taking advantage of the HIPPS system capabilities. The paper will also summarize current industrydesign guidelines that apply to the design of HIPPS.IntroductionHigh integrity pressure protection systems (HIPPS) are the evolution of mechanical and electronic safety devices used in the process industry to handle production or transportation upsets. Simply put, HIPPS is designed to protect low-rated equipment against overpressure or abject flow accompanying the upset condition by either isolating or diverting the upset away from the low-rated equipment. However, HIPPS is more commonly referred to as a "high integrity pipeline protection system", because many HIPPS design/cost studies are associated with field layout pipeline designs.There are two fundamental methods for maintaining a "design break" between the pressure requirement associated with conventional rated equipment and the pressure requirement for low-rated equipment: Maintain an effective barrier at the boundary between the two sections (high and low pressure rating) with a safety shut-off device, and/or Provide a relief safety system in the low-rated system to reduce or maintain the excess fluid flow and thereby limit the build up of pressure in that system 1Deciding whether to use any safety system (or what type) depends on its overall cost and its reliability compared to a more conventional design. The key is "fool proof" reliability taken into account during risk analysis exercises. The barrier or relief system must be both highly effective and reliable and have a low enough failure frequency to represent an acceptable level of risk. Without these features, HIPPS will most assuredly not be recommended, regardless of cost, because of possible adverse consequences to HSE or damage repair.

AB  - ABSTRACT The paper highlights the major subsea/subsurface systems and equipment installed over the past several years which have resulted in the extension of the Argyll Area field life. Three major areas will be addressed emphasising the design philosphy of minimising cost, while maximising flexibility, reliability and the use of simple, existing technology. Details will include the pioneering installation of gas lift, the water flooding of the Duncan field with H's unique manifold system and the remote tie-in of wells 9 miles distant with a simple hydraulic system. INTRODUCTION The subsea system developed for Argyll has been critical to the success of the Argyll Area fields. The equipment installed has enabled three oil fields of different production requirements to be produced safely, reliably and in a cost effective manner. The original philosophy of simplicity of design and use of proven technology has been validated by over twelve years of operating experience.This paper summarises the subsea hardware and the overall design for the subsea production facilities. The design philosophy is founded on the use of proven technology and the simplest mechanical hook-up necessary, to produce safely within the regulatory requirements. DESIGN ENVIRONMENT The challenges faced by the engineers on the original Argyll development in the early 1970's are not altogether different from those today. Risk was foremost in their mind: risk in the form of reservoir uncertainties, economic changes and engineering unknowns. Reservoir engineering has undergone major advances over the years, but fields are still full of surprises both positive and negative. The magnitude of economic uncertainty was probably as great, if not greater then than now. The design of the facilities had to be flexible to cater for potential changes. The size of the Argyll reservoir was judged to be small, approximately 10 million barrels and the field life five years. The price of oil was $9 per barrel in 1974. It took 25 barrels of oil to pay back a capital cost of £100 while today it only takes 10 barrels. The pressure to control costs was as intense then as in today's economic environment.Probably the most significant factor facing the Argyll designers was that in the early 1970's, facilities to produce a field by subsea methods had never been developed. The Argyll Area was the pioneer subsea development. Some field parameters facilitated the selection of a subsea system, but others presented serious challenges. Reservoir fluid characteristics were close to ideal. The sweet crude is 380 API, the flowing pressures and GOR are low and no problems have been experienced with wax, hydrate or sand. Areal extent was such that even at the shallowest reservoir depth of 8,400 ft, either directional wells could be planned or straight holes drilled and tied back to the production facility with flow lines.

AB  - Abstract Industry practice for the design and operation of oil and gas producing wells incorporates a two-barrier policy, and defines an integrity envelope for environmental protection and safe operations.  The standard practice when removing or undertaking major operations on the Xmas tree is to set one or more plugs in the production tubing to maintain two barriers between the reservoir and the environment. This paper assesses the relative risk of using a Down Hole Safety Valve (DHSV) as a qualified barrier during such operations.  Quantitative Risk Assessment (QRA) has been used in this study to understand the implications of the change in working practices. QRA has been used to assess the risks of an uncontrolled flow of fluid from the reservoir when using a qualified DHSV as a barrier as compared to the standard practice of setting one or more wireline plugs.  Three representative cases have been considered in this study: Case 1 examines changing valves downstream of the master valve on a sub sea well. Cases 2 and 3 focus on platform wells. Case 2: changing valves downstream of the lower master valve, and Case 3: removing the Xmas tree. The study shows that the major risk when using a wireline set plug as a downhole barrier arises from the blowout risk associated with wireline operations. Use of a DHSV as a qualified barrier eliminates the wireline blowout risk, and reduces the overall risk during Xmas tree operations. Hence, the study recommends the use of a qualified DHSV as a barrier, subject to a risk assessment on a case by case basis. Introduction Industry practice regarding the design and operation of oil and gas producing wells incorporates a two-barrier policy for safe operation and environmental protection.  At all times there must be two independent barriers in each flow path between the reservoir and the surface.  A barrier in this context is any system that can be used to contain well fluids within the well envelope; examples are a bridge plug or cement, the Xmas tree or blowout preventer (BOP).  A fluid (e.g. drilling, completion or workover fluid) will normally be considered to constitute a barrier provided that the level of the fluid can be monitored and maintained. Standard practice when removing or undertaking major operations on the Xmas tree has been to set one or more plugs within the production tubing to maintain two barriers between the reservoir and the environment.  Typically, any change to these normal procedures and standards requires a quantitative risk assessment as part of the dispensation process. This study was undertaken to assess the relative risk of using the downhole safety valve (normally a Tubing Retrievable Safety Valve, TRSV) as a qualified barrier during such operations.  The initial application was the replacement of a failed production wing valve on a subsea gas producer.  Two further cases were assessed for platform wells; a similar valve changeout downstream of the master valve and complete removal of the Xmas tree.  In each case the risks were assessed when using a DHSV as a barrier for operations on the Xmas tree as opposed to performing interventions to set wireline plugs. The methodology used was to evaluate and quantify the risk of a loss of containment occurring for each scenario using Fault Tree Analysis (FTA). UK Legislation Legislation regarding barrier policy differs greatly between countries, with some having adopted very prescriptive approaches.  In the UK, Health & Safety legislation for the offshore industry does not prohibit the use of a DHSV as a barrier.  The regulations use a goal-setting framework and do not provide a prescriptive guide to the practical application of tools and techniques.   However, it is a requirement of the regulations and standards that well operators and contractors must state their isolations standards for hydrocarbon containment and pressure systems and ensure that these are met in all failure scenarios. The Wells Design and Construction Regulations [DCR]1 Regulation 13(1) requires well-operators to ensure that each well is so designed ……….[and] operated, maintained …….. [so that] so far as is reasonably practicable, there can be no unplanned escape of fluids from the well; and risks to the health and safety of persons from it or anything in it, or in strata to which it is connected, are as low as is reasonable practicable.

AB  - ABSTRACT This paper considers the design criteria-for a subsea "High Integrity Pipeline pressure Protection System" (HIPPS), which enables subsea pipelines to be designed for the operating, rather than the shut in wellhead pressure. Such systems will save considerable investment cost in the development of high pressure offshore oil and gas fields, particularly where the distance to the processing infrastructure is long. The conceptual design of a HIPPS which comprises two rapidly closing valves to protect the pipeline from over-pressure, is described. The reliability of the system is assessed and dynamic simulation of the valve and process flow are discussed. INTRODUCTION General A number of subsea field development studies, in particular for marginal fields, have identified that the flow and pipeline cost represents a significant portion of the total field development cost. The pipeline cost is of course also largely dependent on the reservoir pressure. In some cases where the reservoir pressure was high, the studies clearly showed that the field could not be economically developed due to the high pipeline cost. It was also clear from these studies that if the pipeline could be designed for the maximum operating pressure (MOP) instead of the Shut-in Welihead Pressure (SWHP), many of the developments would be economically feasible. This background prompted the view that a pipeline safety system would be required for the development of high pressure marginal fields. This would then permit transportation of hydrocarbons at reduced pressures. Such a safety system must then ensure that the pipeline pressure can not exceed the design pressure, under any ircumstances. The need for such a system has become even more pronounced over the last few years, with the declining oil price. A safety or protection system should be of high integrity and reliability. Apart from land based application, such a system has already been implemented on an unmanned offshore platform in the North Sea (Sleipner West), to protect the export pipeline (20", 12 km) to the Sleipner B latform. Such systems became known as "High Integrity Pipeline Protection Systems", HIPPS for short. A HIPPS system for subsea application, although principally identical in function to the land based or platform based system, should have even higher reliability and most certainly higher availability due to the difficulty and cost associated with intervention. The probability of hydrate formation and subsequent blockage of the pipeline must be considered. In addition, the special problems associated with a subsea environment would have to be solved. subsea HIPPS system should be able to cope with bothgas and oil fields (high GOR) of high pressure. Design basis In early 1993, in-house studies were initiated with the objective of identifying the problems associated with subsea HIPPS applications and to establish the scope of work for the future development of such a system. The studies concluded that a prototype HIPPS system should be designed, built and qualified. The design work started in august 1994 on the following basis: (Available In Full Paper )Some of the arguments used in arriving at the design basis are discussed below.

AB  - AbstractMany of the latest generation of ultra deepwater capable rigs included emergency BOP (Blow Out Preventer) control capabilities, sometimes referred to as secondary intervention systems. Such systems represent the last line of defense in containing a well. Should it be necessary and unavailable, the result could be environmentally and humanly catastrophic.Building on installations that have been in service for many years, these capabilities range in functionality and purpose, from providing an alternate means to operate BOP functions in the event of total loss of the primary control system to assisting personnel during incidents of imminent equipment failure or well control problems. They can be actuated automatically or manually, and utilize components of the primary BOP control system or be totally independent. With as many permutations as there were rigs built, an understanding of the capabilities and limitations that exist on a particular rig is of critical importance in assessing the risks associated with a drilling program.While there currently are no standard terms in use to describe the essential attributes of systems, this paper recommends definitions and terms for a common understanding. The defined terminology is then utilized to compare and contrast system parameters, identifying various system strengths and weaknesses for use in risk analyses.Possible enhancements to existing emergency control systems will then be discussed, as well as their benefits and anticipated costs. Finally, the paper will recommend best practices for moored rig operations and those for operations utilizing DP (Dynamic Positioning).IntroductionSystematic analysis of emergency control systems can only begin with an agreement upon critical parameters based on common terminology. From this starting point, best systems and practices can be identified as well as recommended opportunities that could enhance these systems' effectiveness.Critical performance issues depend on two issues - type of control system (hydraulic or multiplex) and method of station keeping (anchored or DP). Consequently, four industry best systems and practices are suggested based on the possible permutations of these issues.The most important elements of a well designed secondary intervention system were defined as follows:Fast responseSufficient capacityIndependence from primary system (commonality)Environmentally independentAutomatic activation by loss of hydraulic and electrical power to subsea stackWorks in presence of mud plume or noiseContains well if LMRP (Lower Marine Riser Package) accidentally disconnected and well kicksManually secures non flowing wellAccordingly, system capabilities were evaluated against these criteria.Executive SummaryFor rigs with a multiplex BOP control system operating in DP mode, the recommended system is what is defined herein as a deadman system, with suggested enhancements noted in the Recommended Enhancements Section below to supplement it. For this type of control system operating in anchored mode, the EDS (Emergency Disconnect System) and auto disconnect systems can be eliminated or bypassed. In both cases, an ROV (Remote Operated Vehicle) would be required to manually secure a non flowing well.For rigs with hydraulic control systems, addition of an auto shear circuit is recommended to provide the automatic closure of the well in the event the LMRP is accidentally unlatched. Again, an ROV would be required to secure a non flowing well.

AB  - AbstractZADCO owns more than 500 wells operating in UZ, UA & ST fields to contribute in achieving the production targets as set by the Shareholders. To ensure that wells operate as designed for their assigned life (or greater) with all risks kept as low as reasonably practicable or as mentioned, it is important to insure individual well's integrity. Hence, ZADCO developed an in-house "Well Integrity Management System (WIMS)", which defines & provides the operating standards & guidelines for maintaining the well integrity parameters, ensuring safe well operations and securing well potential availability during its life cycle so that return on investment is maximized without the sacrifice of safety and environment.The implementation of ZADCO's well integrity process follows the cycle assurance testing, preventive measures, monitoring, evaluation / assessment, control & remedy, audit / verification.This paper reviews WIMS in ZADCO. WIMS is structured to include wellhead (surface) equipment, downhole equipment and operational (process control). WIMS places much emphasis on the requirement of barriers for safety and environmental protection.IntroductionThe objective of developing Well Integrity Management System (WIMS) is to provide standard guidelines to ensure that technical integrity of all the wells is maintained throughout their life cycle, they operate under safe condition and are capable to function continuously to achieve the targeted production/injection requirements. Well integrity is based on the establishment and maintenance of confinement barriers in the particular well. As per WIMS standards, a well is considered integral if at least two separate and sound confinement barriers across each flow path between the potential reservoir and surface are available all the time.WIMS very much emphasis on the problem prevention based approach (endeavour to predict & solve the problem before it happens) that can accommodate several direct advantages and benefits like reduction in operating down time, enhancement in well control and safety aspects, minimized unplanned repair intervention & cost impact etc.Major well issues that would have impact on the technical integrity and operability of a well viz; Surface Completion Components (Wellhead & X-mass tree), Sub-surface Completion Components (downhole safety valve (DHSV), Gas lift valves, electric submersible pump (ESP), Well Construction (Casing & Annulus), Communication Problems, Corrosion, Scaling, Non-hydrocarbon Effluents / Products, Well Operation Suspension, Well Intervention Services (Electric/Slick Line, Stimulation, coiled tubing unit (CTU), Risk Management Process & Auditing System, etc. have been thoroughly discussed in the WIMS manual.

AB  - ABSTRACT This paper presents the results of a part of a university research project to determine the hydrodynamic force coefficients of K-lattice jack-up leg using CFD. The so-called K-lattice leg is built up from cylindrical members and three main vertical chords, developed to be used with a rack and pinion jacking system. Analyses are performed for a K-lattice leg with racks and an equivalent circular cylinder based on the regulations. In order to ensure reliable results, benchmark calculations are performed for a K-lattice leg without racks from a typical trussed leg of a self-propped jack-up. The results of the benchmark calculations are compared with published experimental data and the recommended coefficients by DNV-GL (2015). It is found that the CFD results are in good agreement with the available experimental data and DNV-GL coefficients and provide valuable insights into the physics of hydrodynamic loads on the considered types of jack-up leg. INTRODUCTION Since the first jack-up was built, jack-ups have become the most popular type of mobile offshore drilling unit (MODU) for offshore exploration and development purposes in shallow water. The most pivotal component of the jack-up unit is the leg, which can directly affect the global performance of the unit. The leg not only supports the weight of the whole rig, but withstands various external forces, e.g. current, wave, and wind load, and its performance directly affects the criteria of the whole jack-up unit (Liu, 2004; Li et al., 2009; William et al., 1999). So the leg system is considered to be an important component of the jackup. Various types of jack-up legs have been created and especially the cylindrical and trussed types are widely applied in offshore industry. As for the trussed legs, different forms are developed according to the arrangement of the brace, e.g. the reverse K type, X type, and the mixing type are typical forms presently. The largest disagreement between regulations is in calculation procedure and the estimation of hydrodynamic factors for the leg. In dynamic analysis of jack-ups and in calculations of the main global responses of structures due to wave and current forces, an equivalent pile model is often adopted.

AB  - ABSTRACT:A weakly-coupled numerical model for the prediction of both nearshore flows and seabed changes forced by waves and currents is here presented. The model is built on a robust module that solves the Nonlinear Shallow Water Equations (NSWE) and a flexible module for the resolution of the mass-conservation Exner Equation (EE). The coupling issue concerning NSWE and EE is discussed, underlining the importance in the choice of a proper numerical scheme and highlighting the differences among the tested numerical approaches. Simulations have been performed to test the new model, all confirming good performances of the solver. INTRODUCTIONThe correct representation of the beach evolution, induced by the hydrodynamic field due to both nearshore waves and currents, has been sought with increasing incisiveness in the last two decades and numerical simulations are becoming an indispensable tool to reach such a scope. However, as yet, the morphological processes that induce seabed evolution, have not been fully understood neither described adequately by physical principles and mathematical/numerical analyses (Ding et al., 2006). Realistic and feasible numerical simulations of morphological processes are based on approximations of the exact equations involved in the description of both flow and seabed evolution. Such approximations can be classed, as suggested by De Vriend et al. (1993), in: 1) 1D models, for the study of the longshore sediment transport evolution; 2) 2DV models, that enable to predict the vertical variations of seabed profiles; 3) 2DH models, that enable to reproduce all the fundamental nearshore processes, by averaging the main variables over the vertical; 4) fully 3D, local, morphological models. Because of its versatility, accuracy and power in reproducing the nearshore global hydro-morphodynamics, at least at the storm time scale, the wave-resolving 2DH approach has become the most favored for both practical and scientific computations.

AB  - ABSTRACT Lateral variations of the petrophysical parameters in petroleum reservoirs are evidenced by observations in existing wells and quantified by log analysis. This paper presents a method of interpolation based on geostatistical analysis and the associated treatment of log interpretation results. The principle of this method is to capture on existing data the patterns of spatial variations and use this knowledge to derive over the whole field the best estimates of reservoir parameters as well as a measure of their uncertainty. Examples illustrate the possibilities of the method in integrating well logs, seismic data, geology or reservoir model to improve the reservoir description.

AB  - ABSTRACTThe Subsea Atmospheric System (SAS) is part of a deepwater production system that was initially designed; then built and tested onshore and at sea in the 1970's. Recently, an effort was conducted to improve the prototype version and to extend application into deeper waters. This paper discusses the resulting improved design. It describes the updated major hardware components of the SAS, its principal subsystems, and installation procedures.INTRODUCTIONThe Subsea Atmospheric System (SAS) was first designed in 1969, constituting the basic component of a complete deepwater production system intended to handle field production from wellhead through offloading. A full-scale prototype of the SAS was fabricated and tested onshore in 1971. The following year it was installed in the Gulf of Mexico, operated intermittently subsea with live oil production, and retrieved in 1976. These earlier activities have been reported in the referenced technical literature. 1-6 Mobil has continued development of a deepwater production system, anticipating application in typical offshore fields characterized by relatively large hydrocarbon reserves, high well potentials, and deep water. The complete system contains five basic components, identified as follows: (1) The SAS, which based upon a recent project to improve the prototype design is the subject of this paper. (2) The subsea atmospheric riser manifold, designed to manifold production from several SAS units and to provide a base for connecting with the production riser. (3) Flow line bundles, consisting of as many as a dozen lines, to connect each SAS to the riser manifold. (4) A compliant production riser system, consisting of a rigid buoyed pipe section extending from the seabed to about 200 feet below the sea surface, and flexible pipe in centenary configuration extending from the top of the rigid section up to a floating production platform. And (5) a floating production facility, which contains equipment for oil/gas separation, optional gas and water injection, and provision for oil storage and offloading to tankers. Turning now to the SAS, it consists of four major hardware elements, as depicted in Figure 1. A subsea template serves as a base through which peripheral wells are directionally drilled to selected subsurface targets. Drilling is conducted with floater rigs, after which master valve and wellhead connector assemblies are sequentially installed in a wet hyperbaric environment. These wet split Xmas trees connect the wells to the Subsea Work Enclosure (SWE), which is centrally attached to the base template. / In contrast to the wet elements, the SWE provides a dry environment at atmospheric pressure on the seafloor, housing the control valves, chokes, piping, and instrumentation required for automated producing operations. It contains the necessary mechanical internals and supporting subsystems to function as a subsea Mani folding station, while providing for accessible manned entry via submersibles for system maintenance3,5. MAJOR SAS HARDWARE COMPONENTSBase TemplateThe base of the SAS serves as a multi-well template for closely-spaced directional drilling, and provides both support and alignment for the elements connected to it.

AB  - Abstract The Tang South-East platform is unmanned and a combined wellhead and process platform in the North Sea, it was installed to produce and separate the well streams into a vapour phase and a liquid phase, and transfer the gas and liquid in two separate pipelines to another field. There was no automatic relief system or flare system on the Tang South-East platform, and the High Integrity Protection Systems (HIPPS) was built to protect the export gas and liquid pipelines. When water injection is applied later in Tang South-East field, it will lead to possible overpressure for the topside process systems under the situation of direct water hit through fracture. Our solutions to prevent this overpressure can be divided into two parts: First, design new HIPPS. Three transmitters and one Emergency Shut Down Valve (ESDV) are proposed to build downstream of each manifold, working with the other items, including Emergency Shut Down (ESD) and Independent Emergency Shut Down (IESD) panels, Master Control Valves (MCV) and Wing Control Valves (WCV). A reliability study is carried out; the resulting unavailability of the HIPPS is 9.716 x 10-5, which meets the requirement of better performance than a standard relief valve which has an unavailability of 2.12x10-4. Second, change the process system upstream of ESDV according to new design pressure. This paper shows how to define this new design pressure which is higher than original design pressure. HIPPS are chosen in this project basically because they offer lower install cost of flowlines and process systems, and they do not discharge to the environment. Introduction The Tang South-East (TSE) platform is unmanned and a combined wellhead and process platform, it is located in the North Sea. The design of the process system on TSA platform includes production from 7 wells, including 2 gas wells and 5 oil wells. TSA platform is installed to produce and separate the well streams into a vapor phase and a liquid phase, and transfer the gas and liquid in pipelines to some other fields. There is no water injection on the TSA platform now. On the TSA platform, each well is connected by flowlines to two production manifolds for separation and export as well as to the test manifold. The crude can be led to High Pressure (HP) separator, Low Pressure (LP) separator, and multiphase test meter from three different manifolds respectively. There is no automatic relief system or flare system on the TSA to protect the flowlines and process systems. The export pipelines are protected against overpressure by High Integrity Pressure Protection Systems (HIPPS). If water injection is applied later in the field life, it may have an influence on the wellhead and the topsides. This will in some case lead to an overpressure and result in a requirement for additional protection. Mechanism of Overpressure On TSE platform, to ensure that the reservoir can be safely isolated, wellhead and parts of the topsides piping system was designed to a pressure which is higher than the maximum pressure that the reservoir can generate at the topsides. This pressure is defined as the initial pressure in the reservoir minus a gas gradient to the surface, and this pressure can also called tubing head pressure.

AB  - SummaryIn scaled laboratory tests, we perform acoustic measurements in a time-lapse sequence to separate the fracture response from the background signal. Using both compressional waves and shear waves (that are very sensitive to fluid filled fractures) we can not only detect the hydraulic fracture, but also characterize its shape and geometry during its growth. We show the application of the technique to propagation, flowback tests and re-opening of hydraulic fractures.During fracture growth the acoustic waves excite diffractions at the tip of the fracture. We use the direct compressional and shear diffractions to locate the position of the tip of the fracture. The ultrasonic data show that the diffractions are most strongly excited at the fluid front of the hydraulic fracture. In some cases, a much weaker precursor diffraction can be detected which is interpreted as the dry tip of the fracture. Depending on the acquisition geometry, we detect many events related to surface waves propagating along the fracture. Also, we observe that shear waves detect the migration of the fluid front during re-opening of a pre-existing hydraulic fracture, in contrast with the compressional waves which are insensitive to the fluid front during re-opening.Observation of transmission signals through the fracture yields a very accurate measurement of the fracture width. In this way we have obtained the full fracture width profile during propagation and closure. Flow back resulted in closing the fracture at the wellbore, while it remained open farther from the wellbore.

AB  - AbstractMicroseismic monitoring of hydraulic fracturing has provided great value for understanding hydraulic fracturing in unconventional reservoirs, including measurement of fracture geometry and optimization of stimulations, completions, and field development. Nevertheless, microseismic monitoring is a complex endeavor and many issues of fielding, analysis, uncertainty, and geophysics should be carefully assessed. The geomechanics of the generation of microseismicity are still being investigated, as well as the source mechanisms and how it all relates to the fracturing process. Besides the value for field development and resource recovery, microseismic monitoring has also proved useful for evaluating environmental and safety issues. Data from thousands of fractures show that the levels of induced seismicity in typical relaxed sedimentary basins are well below any levels that would be of concern for safety or damage. Similarly, data from thousands of fractures show that hydraulic fractures in shale reservoirs do not propagate into aquifers.

AB  - Summary Estimating reservoir-flow capacity is crucial for production estimation, hydraulic-fracturing design, and field development. Laboratory experiments can be used to measure the permeability of rock samples, but the results might not be representative at a field scale because of reservoir heterogeneity and pre-existing natural-fracture systems. Diagnostic fracture-injection tests (DFITs) have now become standard practice to estimate formation pore pressure and formation permeability. However, in low-permeability reservoirs, after-closure radial flow is often absent and this can result in significant uncertainties in interpreting DFIT data. In addition, the established methods for analyzing DFIT data make two oversimplified assumptions: Carter leakoff and constant fracture compliance (or stiffness) during fracture closure. However, both assumptions are violated during fracture closure; therefore, G-function-based models and subsequent related work can lead to an incorrect interpretation and are not capable of consistently fitting both before- and after-closure data coherently. Moreover, current after-closure analysis relies on classic well-test solutions with a constant injection rate. In reality, a “constant injection rate” does not equal “constant leakoff rate into the formation,” because more than 90% of the injected fluid stays inside the fracture at the end of pumping instead of leaking into the formation. The variable leakoff rate clearly violates the constant-rate boundary condition used in existing well-test solutions. In this study, we extend our previous work and derive time-convolution solutions to pressure-transient behavior of a closing fracture with infinite and finite fracture conductivity. We show that the G-function and the square-root-of-time models are only special cases of our general solutions. In addition, we found that after-closure linear-flow and bilinear-flow analysis can be used to infer pore pressure reliably but fail to estimate other parameters correctly. Most importantly, we present a new approach to history match the entire duration of DFIT data to estimate formation-flow capacity, even without knowing closure stress and the roughness properties of the fracture surface. Our approach adds significant value to DFIT interpretation and uncertainty analysis, especially in unconventional reservoirs where the absence of after-closure radial flow is the norm. Two representative field cases are also presented and discussed.

AB  - AbstractThe in-service fatigue loading of risers may include contributions from first and second order vessel motions, wave loadings, vortex induced vibration (VIV), vortex induced motion (VIM), pressure variation and slugging. All of these loadings are variable amplitude random loadings where the sequence of cycles can change the fatigue outcome. The loading sequence effects can be addressed in analysis through cycle counting methods and through use of the most appropriate methods of damage accumulation. High loads can be responsible for either fatigue crack growth retardation or acceleration depending up loading sequence. The Rainflow Counting method takes into account the whole loading algorithm and assumes the structure memory sustains all through the loading. The Simple Range Count method counts cycles by every single reversals and does not take into account the load sequence or material memory. Fatigue damage accumulation can be accomplished using a linear model like Palmgren-Miner or a nonlinear model. Fatigue life can be estimated using crack growth methods, S-N or strain life methods. For each method some tools are available that can account for sequence effects. The fatigue analysis of the riser system is illustrated step by step. This study particularly looks at how different cycle counting methods affect the fatigue damage estimate obtained with the S-N approach, strain-life approach and fatigue crack growth approach. In the study Rainflow and Simple Range cycle counting methods are applied to variable amplitude loads typical of deepwater riser systems.

AB  - ABSTRACTRoom and pillar deformation were measured in conjunction with a relatively new type of mining operation in a southeastern New Mexico potash mine. The extraction ratio was approximately 90 percent in a first mining operation. Due to severe deformations encountered, instrumentation had to be developed/ modified for these measurements. This paper concentrates on experiment design, design of special instrumentation, field installation of equipment, and presentation of the data. Measurements made include extensometers in the pillar, in the floor and ceiling in the room between pillars, “absolute” level measurements, floor ceiling closure, and stress (strain) measurements. Associated laboratory rock mechanics measurements of samples from the mine are being done separately.Two separate room pillar complexes were instrumented. In the first complex, floor-ceiling deformations of approximately 1 inch/day and pillar deformations around 1/2 inch/day were measured. In the second complex, instrumentation was installed while the pillar was a part of a long wall and the subsequent sequential mining (long wall-pillar with only one adjoining room on one side - pillar in the middle of room pillar complex) was observed. Data return from this operation was good.INTRODUCTIONSandia National Laboratory has implemented an interrelated matrix of experiments performed in salt in support of the Waste Isolation Pilot Plant (WIPP). The goals of the overall program are to obtain scientific and engineering data applicable to the design of emplacement and containment systems for radioactive waste disposal in bedded salt formations in southeastern New Mexico and to acquire information to resolve generic technical issues relevant to isolation of high-level waste in salt formations.The work reported herein is one phase of this overall program and involves the measurement of room and pillar deformations in a Southeastern New Mexico Potash mine. The work was a joint effort between Sandia and Mississippi Chemical Company (MCC) to monitor pillar deformations at ambient temperature conditions in an ongoing mining operation. The relatively new mining system employed by Mississippi Chemical Company involves 90 percent extraction of ore in a first mining operation. The remaining 10 percent is left in the form of a symmetric array of small pillars which undergo severe deformations over relatively short periods of time. This mining approach provides a unique opportunity to monitor large deformations all the way to failure, to document the failure mechanisms, and to provide detailed data on large deformations due to mining for subsequent comparison with numerical techniques.An agreement was made with the MCC which allowed Sandia personnel to instrument two rooms and adjacent pillars along the advancing mine face. The mining engineering department of Mississippi Chemical Company provided support in this effort. Deformation measurements were taken for a number of weeks following each installation.Large rock samples from appropriate horizons were taken for laboratory determination of material properties. These measured material ·properties are now being used in computer modeling. Both the laboratory data and the modeling work will be reported separately.

AB  - AbstractBarium sulphate scale formation can occur readily in the wellbores of the Forties field when produced water containing a high barium ion concentration mixes with injection sea water of a high sulphate ion concentration. Typically scale formation begins with the onset of sea water breakthrough into a wellbore and can lead to very rapid production declines. To date, seven coiled tubing scale millouts have been performed on producing wells in the Forties field. These performed on producing wells in the Forties field. These operations have resulted in a combined 39,000 bbl/d (6201 m3/d) increase in production. This paper describes the mechanism of barium sulphate scale formation and the mechanical removal of the scale using coiled tubing with downhole motors, bits and underreamers. A scale millout case history is presented and the successful prevention of scale formation via scale inhibitor treatments is discussed IntroductionThe Forties Field was discovered in October 1970 and is located in the Central North Sea (Figure 1). The main reservoir is a Paleocene sandstone in a four way dip closed anticline which initially contained 614 feet (187 m) of oil column with the original OWC at 7273 ft (2217 m) vertical depth subsea (Table 1). The recovery mechanism is bottom aquifer drive supported by peripheral seawater injection. The main field is developed from four platforms, Alpha, Bravo, Charlie and Delta (Figure 2). They have the same basic design and are all capable of fluid separation, NGL recovery, treating produced water for disposal and injecting seawater for reservoir pressure maintenance. Typical well completions are shown in Figures 3 and 4. Production from the main field commenced in September Production from the main field commenced in September 1975. In March 1987 production stared from a fifth, minimum facility platform, located to the southeast of the main field to drain a lobe of the main reservoir. To date, 85% of the 2.48 billion barrel (396 Mm3) reserves have been produced. In common with other mature producing fields in the North Sea the challenges ahead are to stem production declines and reduce water production at the lowest possible operating cost. High levels of water production possible operating cost. High levels of water production can exacerbate scale formation which in turn can seriously impact oil production rates. Scale was first noted in the Forties Field in the early 1980's. A number of years elapsed before it became cost effective to alleviate the scale problem since oil production targets could be achieved with ease. Eventually the scale problem was pin-pointed as a major loss of revenue and a programme pin-pointed as a major loss of revenue and a programme of mechanical scale removal and chemical mitigation was implemented. The paper discusses the mechanism of scale formation in the Forties Field, the successful application of coiled tubing milling for scale removal and scale inhibition via squeeze treatments. P. 79

AB  - Abstract Traditional proppant placement evaluation in hydraulically induced fractures utilize detection of radioactive (R/A) tracers such as iridium 192, scandium 46 and antimony 124, which are manufactured in nuclear reactors, and then shipped to the wellsite and pumped downhole with the frac slurry. Although this technique has proven useful, it involves environmental, safety, and regulatory concerns/issues. Recently a new technology has become available that offers a viable alternative to radioactive tracers. Field examples of the application of this technology and its usefulness to the operator are presented in this paper, along with a field comparison to the results from R/A tracers. The new technology utilizes a non-radioactive ceramic proppant (CEP) that contains a high thermal neutron capture compound (HTNCC). This high thermal neutron capture compound is inseparably incorporated into each ceramic proppant grain during manufacturing in sufficiently low concentration so as not to affect proppant properties. The non-radioactive proppant is detected using standard compensated neutron and/or pulsed neutron tools, with detection based on the high thermal neutron absorptive properties of the proppant relative to downhole constituents. Multiple zones in two wells in Wyoming were hydraulically fractured utilizing the non-radioactive detectable ceramic proppant. In addition, multiple zones in a well in Utah were fractured utilizing the non-radioactive detectable proppant and the results are compared to results from an R/A tracer utilized in another well in the same field. These field results and comparisons will aid the frac engineer in choosing appropriate proppant detection techniques. Introduction Hydraulic fracturing is a commonly used technique to economically produce hydrocarbons from subsurface formations, especially formations with low permeability. In hydraulic fracturing, proppant laden fluid is pumped downhole under high pressure, causing the formations to fracture. When pumping ceases, the fractures close on the proppant leaving high permeability conduits that promote the flow of hydrocarbons into the wellbore. The fracture closure stress often exceeds 5,000 to 10,000 psi, which must be borne by the proppant. This closure stress, coupled with the reservoir conditions and expected flow rates, will dictate the optimal choice of proppant (uncoated sand, resin coated sand or ceramic). The optimal proppant will be one that maximizes the economic return of the well under realistic conditions [Palisch 2007].

AB  - Summary Degradations or interruptions of the original well-barrier elements might occur at offshore wells after some time in operation. Experience from the Norwegian Continental Shelf (NCS) has shown that these problems are not always treated as thoroughly as expected by the parties involved. This paper presents an approach for an efficient visualization and description of interrupted well barriers, basically to increase the well-barrier control and management. By mapping the history of operational demands and load picture of the well in combination with the status of well barriers, a consistent basis for evaluations is obtained. The main intention is thus to realize the real well problem and its underlying causes in a controlled and systematic manner. Then, the responsible parties involved can take action more accurately according to the type of failure that has been revealed. Introduction Interrupted barrier elements are related to well integrity and are critical from the point of view of safety, but also concerning production regularity and costs. Failure in the well-barrier functions caused by degradations or interruptions of barrier elements needs immediate attention from the responsible bodies. During drilling and well activities, there are always to be at least two independent and tested well barriers after the surface casing is in place, according to the activities regulations of the Norwegian Petroleum Safety Authority (PSA) (2006). Experience from PSA (Vignes et al. 2006) has shown that barrier failures occur both in newly drilled wells and in wells that have been in operation for some time. Well-integrity failures may be latent in the early constructing phase, or imposed through later maintenance tasks. Shifting between well operational phases can also initiate abnormal load situations causing well-integrity failures to occur. Many of these "unexpected" loads are not necessarily taken into account in the design phase. An investigation carried out by the PSA on the NCS showed that 14% of 309 checked wells currently in operation had problems with, or deviations related to, the well integrity (Vignes et al. 2006). Experience has also shown that integrity problems are not always treated as systematically and thoroughly as expected by the well operators. The main objective of this paper is to present a visualization method for the purpose of evaluating well-integrity problems that communicates facts about integrity problems to the responsible bodies. Intended users of the approach are operators, contractors, government/safety authorities, researchers, and consultants who have interest in carrying out assessments of well-integrity matters. As one possible application, the options regarding the future operation of wells may be clarified by the operator, with new preconditions and operational limitations. A brief introduction to the technical-problem area is given from a system perspective. Important casing-hanger loads are described including those operational and geological factors that make the casing-hanger load reach abnormal values. Then, a description of the three-step visualization method follows. Implications of the method are discussed, and some remarks regarding applications are given. Finally, some conclusions are outlined.

AB  - Abstract This paper describes the need for and subsequent development of a firesafe device which locks open wellhead surface safety valves while conducting through-wellhead operations, and which is manually releasable to allow closure of the valve in an emergency. The device incorporates a eutectic material which will provide for closure of the valve in a fire and meets the requirements of API Specification 14D for fusible lockopen devices. Existing fusible lockopen equipment used by offshore operators is not manually releasable once the hold-open pressure applied to the actuator is released (by activation of the platform emergency shutdown system) due to the large forces involved. This new assembly is a significant improvement over existing equipment because : (1) it is manually releasable, (2) it can be released remotely by utilizing a cable/pulley system (3) all component parts are retained upon release, (4) it is adaptable to parts are retained upon release, (4) it is adaptable to most valves and actuators currently in use, and (5) it greatly enhances well shut-in capabilities while conducting through-wellhead operations. Background All offshore wellheads in Federal waters are required to have the second gate valve in the wellhead flowstream to be "fail-safe". A "fail-safe" surface safety valve, or SSV, is a reverse-acting gate valve (normally closed valve) that will automatically return to the closed position (fail-close) at loss of actuator control pressure without human assistance. When a lockopen device is used on the SSV it also must comply with the "fail-safe" requirements. The following API Specification 14D definitions will help clarify the terminology: * Heat Sensitive Lockopen Device - A device installed on an SSV actuator to maintain the SSV valve in a full open position, until exposed to sufficient heat to cause the device to release and allow the SSV valve to close. * Normally Closed Valve - A valve which will shift to the closed position upon loss of the power media. * Surface Safety Valve (SSV) - An automatic wellhead valve assembly which will close upon loss of power supply. The SSV assembly includes the SSV valve and the SSV actuator. P. 463

AB  - ABSTRACTThis paper presents numerical results utilising the open-source C++ libraries of OpenFOAM (Foundation version 4.1) to simulate the interaction of focused wave events with a fixed FPSO-like structure. The Reynolds-Averaged Navier Stokes (RANS) equations are solved using a finite volume approach for two, incompressible, fluids using a volume of fluid (VOF) interface capturing scheme. Wave generation and absorption is achieved via linear superposition of first order wave components, derived from the empty tank data, and the relaxation zone method from the waves2Foam toolbox. Various wave steepness, ranging from ka = 0.13 to 0.21, and incident wave angles, 0, 10 and 20°, are considered. The effect of turbulence is also evaluated through use of the k - ω SST turbulence closure model. The wave run-up and the pressure on the surface of the structure are examined and have been contributed for comparison with both physical and alternative numerical data as part of the CCP-WSI Blind Test Series 1.INTRODUCTIONThis paper presents work that was conducted as part of the CCP-WSI Blind Test Series 1, which focuses on the interaction of focused wave events with a fixed scale-model Floating Production Storage and Offloading (FPSO) type structure. A numerical evaluation was conducted using the open-source computational fluid dynamics (CFD) software, Open-FOAM, and, following the CCP-WSI Blind Test Series 1 was split into two parts which are summarised in Table 1: Part 1 focuses on the role of wave steepness on pressure and run-up on the bow of a FPSO hull through variation of the steepness parameter ka, whilst keeping the incident angle constant (0°); Part 2 considers the effect of wave propagation direction through variation of the incident wave angle, θ, with the steepness kept constant at ka = 0.17. The effects of turbulence were also evaluated through the use of the k - ω SST turbulence model. This paper is structured such that the numerical model and setup are discussed, followed by work to reproduce empty tank data provided from the physical experiments and the results submitted to the blind tests. Finally the conclusions are drawn.

AB  - Abstract Downhole Safety Valve is an integral part of Well Integrity Mangement System and acts as a failsafe equipment to prevent uncontrolled release of reservoir fluids. Periodic inspection and maintenance of downhole Safety Valve is essential under normal service conditions. Each Downhole Safety Valve should be tested and lubricated at specified regular intervals as recommended by ADNOCs Standard Operating Procedure and as dictated by field experience. Since it is a Critical Safety Equipment, preventive maintenance of Wireline Retrievable type downhole Safety Valve is being carried out annually which involves valve retrieval, leak/function test and redressing if required. Current practice within ADNOC Onshore is to carry out redressing with third party for all Wireline Retrievable Safety Valve annually or in case they are observed to be passing (not meeting the maximum acceptable gas leak rate of 15 scf/min for gas and 400 cc/min for liquid) or do not pass function test carried out during 6 monthly and yearly Preventive Maintenance Schedule. The cost incurred for third party redressing is substantial and can be optimized by evaluating the possibility of carrying out redressing in-house with available resources and using Original Equipment Manufacturer redress kit in situations where internal leak is not observed in the valve and valve can be redressed without the need to open tension spring and flow tube which requires extensive redressing setup available with third party. The new proposal helped in saving cost and time for redressing by utilizing the available resources and formalising in-house redressing wherever applicable under compliance to ADNOC Onshore competent authority guidelines.

AB  - ABSTRACATThis paper outlines the theoretical principles of the ultrasonic technique of creeping waves and discusses their advantages over existing methodology for testing weldments. In this technique, ultrasound is transmitted by compression waves at a very low angle into the weldment and thereby compliments existing ultrasonic testing by working with in 3-4 mm of the entry surface. Creeping waves can therefore be used to supplement and sometimes replace Magnetic Particle Inspection (MPI) and/or Dye Penetrant Inspection (DPI) for examiningwelds in offshore structures and other structures or vessels requiring defect evaluation at or near the surface. 1.INTRODUCTIONbr/>Creeping waves have been around for a number of years, being used in the power generation sector for detecting crackingunder cladding of vessels used in reactors. Initial usage of creeping waves in the offshore fabrication industry was to resolve production problems stemming from spurious M.P.I. indications along the toes of submerged arc welds. Details of this and the further practical developments of this are detailed further on in the text. This report covers the practical application of creeping waves, but first it is necessary to give a brief outline of the theory. 2.THEORYCreeping wave probes consist of twin transducers which generate compression waves at angles between 70° and 90°. The waves from the part of the beam which travel parallel to the surface are called creeping waves (see Fig. 1). The ultrasonic probe also generates shear waves by mode conversion from the compression wave and these have anangle of incidence of 33-38°. Since the creeping wave is derived from the compression wave and travels first beneath the surface, it is unaffected by weld splatter, surface condition or change of geometry such as seen at a weld toe. Because of this tolerance the creeping wave probe can be used in many applications where surface wave probes are totally unsuitable. It has been found that the type of creeping wave probe used in this work gave the best practical results when usable beam path was kept to a maximum of 60 mm. 3.EQUIPMENTThe equipment used apart from the probe is conventional A-scan portable ultrasonic equipment. The probe found to give the best results is a twin crystal 4 MHZ with crystal sizes of 6x13 mm, with a focus of 10 mm and a squint angle of 20°. The test block (see Fig. 2) was a piece of BS4360 50D plate material which was similar to the material under test. The dimension of the block was 20 mm thick and approximately 50 mm wide and 300 mm long. The block had 3 notches spark eroded in the surface of 0.25 mm, 0.5 mm, and 0.75 mm depth. The width of these slots was 0.2 mm. Spark erosion was chosen as the method of producing the slots as this technique gave the smallest width with the most consistency and accuracy. The only other ultrasonic equipment required is a twin crystal 0° compression probe of the same frequency as the creeping wave probe.

AB  - Objectives/Scope: Subsea high-integrity pressure protection systems (HIPPS) have become a standard feature in numerous subsea fields around the globe. Subsea HIPPS' reduced pipeline costs are proven to shorten delivery times for pipelines by decreasing their pressure rating in green field projects or by including high-pressure wells into brownfield projects without modifying rating in existing pipelines. New frontiers for HIPPS are created by high-pressure (7.5 to 20 kpi) and high-temperature (100° to 200°C) applications, as current pressure transmitters, valves and actuators reach their limits. Furthermore, each HIPPS challenges engineering to achieve a compromise between functional safety and reliability - especially in demanding HPHT fields. These opposing characteristics within the protection systems cannot be treated separately but have to be evaluated as two closely related aspects of engineering. This paper covers the balancing of these two engineering areas by using the numerical evaluation of probability of failure on demand (PFD) and failure rate (FR) figures. The evaluation is based on safety integrity level 3 (SIL 3) low-demand HIPPS, for which relevant subcomponents and system failure behaviours were simulated. Different HIPPS architectures were applied based on various process sensors, logic solver and final element quantities and their arrangements.

AB  - Summary Downhole seismic monitoring of an unconventional tight-sand unit in central Alberta was undertaken during a multi-stage hydraulic fracture (HF) treatment in September 2012. Acquisition of continuous passive seismic data continued during the subsequent flowback and production periods spanning over 10 months, with the objective of developing a geomechanical model for microseismic activity associated with treatment, flowback and production of the unconventional gas reservoir. A total of 1660 microseismic events were located during the two-day HF treatment program. The distribution of microseismicity reveals a relatively complex fracture pattern, with evidence for partial control on fracture azimuth by the regional stress field; upward growth of fractures (~ 100m) through overlying coal beds into siliclastic rocks; post-pumping microseismic activity; and evidence for a pressure shadow around the vertical monitor well (a recent gas producer). Several microseismic event swarms, with low S/P amplitude ratios characteristic of tensile failure, occurred within the first hour of flowback initiation and are interpreted as closure of unpropped fractures. Long-period, long-duration (LPLD) microseismic events occurred episodically during all stages of the acquisition and are interpreted as activation of slow slip on pre-existing fractures. A “tuning fork” configuration for the treatment wells provided decreasing separation of the treatment zones from toe to heel. This led to sampling of distinct reservoir facies and stress environments, as documented by variable microseismic response along the lateral treatment wells.

AB  - AbstractThe accurate prediction of the downhole pressures and the returning flow rates in low-head drilling (LHD) and under-balanced drilling operations (UBD) is a major concern in the oil industry. The present work shows an original formulation of a dynamic two-phase flow model based on the classic drift-flux set of conservation equations. However, differently from the traditional approach, the closure of the system is obtained by using measured data acquired during the execution of the operation. The innovative concept consists of utilizing mechanistic models that are dependent on unknown parameters. These parameters and the model state are calculated and updated on a regular basis to minimize the differences between model predictions and measured data. The potential of this new approach is discussed by presenting some transient examples of application. The current study represents a continuation of previous work on real time data interpretation1, and a step in the development of a methodology for the introduction of learning while drilling process in the hydraulic design and follow-up of LHD and UBD operations.IntroductionA successful UBD or LHD operation requires control of downhole pressures and management of the fluids flowing out of the well, which are affected by injection of fluids, reservoir inflow performance, and operational procedures. However, these parameters are inevitably subject to fluctuations that cause transient responses to the multiphase system. As a consequence, the task of controlling the operation is difficult and requires massive efforts for training crews. Besides, the engineering tools and models usually adopted for designing and following up the operations are complex, but not always reliable. Their reliability depends very much on specific features of the operational scenario. In this situation, the Aadoption of a "learning while doing" philosophy adds real value to the process. It happens because the introduction of a self-improvement element not only remedies some disparities still present in most of the models in current use, but also enhances significantly the level of confidence in the process as a whole.As several parameters like injection rates, downhole pressure, choke pressure and outlet rates are usually measured during UBD or LHD operations, a methodology has been developed for incorporating these acquired data in a continuously updated transient model. The idea is to estimate the different parameters and flow variables in the multiphase model to give a correct interpretation of the conditions in the well. Based on this interpretation, the future state of the UBD or LHD drilling system can be predicted. Proactive actions can then be taken if the predicted transients are unacceptable for the system. The model can be used to predict consequences of changes of the UBD or LHD drilling system in specific situations like connections and shut down.The developed methodology is applied to both synthetic generated measured data and measured data from full-scale drilling operations. Several transient cases with drillstring injection are considered, and the ability to predict the state of the circulation system for the different cases is discussed. The quality of the predictions depends on the types of measurements that are taken during the operation.Dynamic ModelA dynamic model for describing the transient behavior of the two-phase flow conditions in LHD and UBD operations can be expressed with basis in the drift-flux formulation of the two-phase flow conservation laws2. Due to the complexity of the model, a numerical solution strategy is required.

This paper presents an overview of some of these advances to presents an overview of some of these advances to provide the reader with a perspective of the current provide the reader with a perspective of the current fracturing state of the art. The discussion addresses economic design considerations; fracturing material behavior (propping agents, fracture conductivity, fluid loss, fluid rheology and proppant transport); field acquired fracture design, diagnostic and analysis technology (in-situ stresses and stress profiling, downhole fracturing pressure and pressure decline analysis, real-time on-site pressure decline analysis, real-time on-site monitoring and control, and fracture mapping); and three-dimensional fracture propagation simulation. A comprehensive bibliography is provided as a resource for in-depth perusal of each area by the interested reader. Introduction In 1982 at the International Meeting on Petroleum Engineering in Beijing, China, Veatchl Petroleum Engineering in Beijing, China, Veatchl presented an overview of the status of hydraulic presented an overview of the status of hydraulic fracturing treatment and design technology. Many of the facets of this paper were updated in a subsequent paper in 1983. During the past 2-3 years, fracturing technology and its application throughout the industry have made significant progress. This paper focuses on many of the recent advancements which have developed since the previous papers were published. It attempts to provide the reader with a perspective of the current state of the art of fracturing. The discussion surveys the many aspects of fracturing, touching only briefly on each. It is outside the scope of the paper to present an in-depth coverage of all the details of the technology. What is given is a rather general overview of the recent advancements in technology and the application by the industry. For the sake of continuity, many of the references contained in the previous papers are included along with references of recent work. This provides the interested reader a rather comprehensive resource to a more in-depth exploration of the technology of fracturing. The work presented here primarily covers hydraulic fracturing treatment applications and design. There is minimal reference to the reservoir performance analysis technology associated with performance analysis technology associated with fracturing. The discussion emphasizes (1) economic design considerations; (2) fracturing material behavior including propping agents and fracture conductivity, fluid loss, fluid rheology, proppant transport, and new data on foamed fracturing fluids; (3) field acquired data for fracture design including in-situ stress data and profiling, diagnostic data from downhole fracturing pressures and from pressure decline, real-time on-site monitoring and control capabilities, and fracture mapping technology; and (4) three-dimensional fracture propagation simulation models. propagation simulation models. FRACTURING ECONOMIC OPTIMIZATION The concept of optimizing fracturing treatment designs, generally speaking, has three basic steps: The first (upper left portion of Fig. 1) is to evaluate the increased income which might be expected from oil or gas producing performance resulting from various fracture lengths and conductivities; the second (lower left portion of Fig. 1) is to determine the costs required to achieve the various lengths and conductivities; and the third (right side of Fig. 1) is to evaluate the net revenue (i.e., income minus costs) versus fracture length to determine the treatment design that yields the maximum net revenue, i.e., the optimum design.

AB  - AbstractThis paper presents data from laboratory scale hydraulic fracturing experimentation with acoustic emission (AE) monitoring. The motivation is firstly to confirm existence of the post-injection surge in the AE rate observed by other investigators. Secondly, unlike previous investigations, a re-pressurization stage is included to test whether AE is driven by the interaction of the two hydraulic fracture surfaces as they contact one another during the closure period that follows an injection-shut in cycle. Our results show that the AE rate indeed increases when the pressure is relieved after the first injection/propagation stage. However, re-opening the fracture through a second pressurization and allowing it to close again proved unsuccessful in causing a second increase in the AE rate. Instead, the AE rate is observed to decay hyperbolically with the time from the first moment of pressure relief with no impact from the second injection/closure stage. This hyperbolic decay in AE rate is in accordance with Omori’s law, that is, it is statistically similar to earthquake aftershocks. The AE in our laboratory experiments were therefore apparently not associated with closure but rather to the somewhat surprising propensity of the rock to produce AE aftershocks from the vicinity of a hydraulic fracture under zero-loading conditions during the hours to days following its creation.

AB  - Abstract Over the past two decades, Diagnostic Fracture Injection Tests (DFIT) or Injection-Fall-off Fracture Calibration Tests have evolved into a commonly used and reliable technique to evaluate reservoir properties, fracturing parameters and obtain in-situ stresses. Since the introduction of DFIT analysis based on G-function and its derivative, this method has become standard practice for quantifying minimum in-situ stress and leak-off coefficient. However, the pressure decline model that underlies the G-function plot makes two distinct and important assumptions: (1) leak-off is not pressure-dependent and, (2) fracture stiffness (or compliance) is assumed to be constant during fracture closure. Fracture closure is a gradual process that starts when asperities at the fracture tip first come into contact with each other. As pressure declines due to leak-off, more and more of the fracture wall comes into contact. It is important to model this process quantitatively to obtain good estimates of in-situ stresses and leak-off. In this paper, we present a model that accounts for changes in fracture stiffness/compliance as the fracture closes, with leak-off that is dependent on fracture pressure. The model is, therefore, capable of analyzing DFIT data from the end of pumping to days or even weeks after shut-in. We first review Nolte's original G-function model and examine the assumptions inherent in the model. We then present a new global pressure transient model for pressure decline after shut-in which not only preserves the physics of unsteady-state reservoir flow behavior, elastic fracture mechanics and material balance, but also incorporates the gradual changes of fracture stiffness/compliance due to the contact of rough fracture walls during closure. This global model allows us to analyze the whole spectrum of DFIT data by bridging before closure and after closure data seamlessly. Analysis of synthetic cases, along with field data are presented to demonstrate how the coupled effects of fracture geometry, fracture surface asperities, formation properties, pore pressure and wellbore storage can impact fracturing pressure decline and the estimation of minimum in-situ stress. It is shown that so-called "normal leak-off" behavior that is modeled using Carter leak-off is an oversimplification that leads to significant errors in the interpretation of the data. All the before closure analysis conducted under a "normal leak-off" assumption should be reexamined cautiously. Most importantly, this article reveals that previous methods of estimating minimum in-situ stress often lead to significant over or underestimates, because of their failure to account for changes in fracture stiffness/compliance correctly as the fracture closes progressively from the edge to the center. Based on our modeling and simulation results, we propose a much more accurate and reliable method to estimate the minimum in-situ stress, fracture pressure dependent leak-off rate and evaluate the compliance of the un-propped fracture.

AB  - SummaryWe conducted a series of hydraulic-fracture experiments to examine improvements in seismic-fracture diagnostic technology that are available with the application of advanced receiver capabilities. We present characteristics of the microseisms, tool response behavior, and the results of the tests.IntroductionSome form of stimulation, usually hydraulic fracturing, is required for the economic production of gas from tight reservoirs. A longsought objective is the incorporation of hydraulic-fracture models with real-time diagnostic measurements of the fracture process. One potential diagnostic technique involves the monitoring of induced seismic emissions (commonly referred to as acoustic emissions, microseismic events, or microseisms) to map the hydraulic-fracture field. The measurement methodology involves the placement of one or more seismic sensors in either the stimulation well or an adjacent monitoring well to determine the origin of the microseismic events. Typically, a wall-locking, three-component geophone instrument is used to sample the vector wave field produced by the microseisms. The data from the three geophones are then processed such that the linearly polarized particle motion of the compressional wave is used to infer the orientation of the fracture plane. So that we can use this approach, however, the seismic receiver instrument must record faithfully the particle motion of the seismic wave field that is incident on the borehole. The conventional wall-locking geophone instrument generally does not enable the accurate measurement of particle motion over a wide frequency range. The limited frequency range results from both locking resonances in the clamp sensor module and from the high frequency limitations of conventional geophones. To overcome the limitations presented by the wall-locking geophone system, we used an alternative borehole seismic receiver to extend the usable frequency range out to 1,500 cycles/sec. The receiver uses a novel clamp mechanism that enables its resonant frequency to be above 2,000 cycles/sec. Additionally, solid-state accelerometers are used as the sensing device, thereby eliminating spurious modes, phase errors, and high-frequency noise limitations. The resulting seismic receiver is capable of accurate particle-motion measurement to frequencies nearly an order of magnitude higher than previously reported. This suggests that much improved detection and location of micro seismic events can be obtained to map a hydraulic fracture.

AB  - Abstract The Andrew asset is a strategic hub for BP in the Central North Sea and has been producing from the Palaeocene oil reservoir for the past twenty-two years through a small fixed platform. In addition to the conventional Palaeocene oil reserves, there is an underlying Lower Cretaceous gas-condensate reservoir. The A11z well was drilled as an appraisal well within this low permeability formation and the original completion in 1998 was designed with the intent of performing a future hydraulic fracture. Extended well tests however, identified that gas production facilities were required for production and these were not provided until platform redevelopment in 2015. The stimulation operation has been delayed since due to the highly complex interfaces on an ageing asset and prioritisation of plant reliability work scopes and other simpler intervention work scopes. Due to the increasing strategic importance of a new black start gas well for the asset hub, the alignment of priorities between the different functions was addressed and the hydraulic fracture operations were executed in June 2018. A multi-disciplinary project team has been established with a remit to manage and simplify the work scopes, enabling an efficient stimulation operation and a safe flowback with minimal impact to the platform reliability. The optimal design for a reliable proppant hydraulic fracture treatment has been crucial to deliver this Regional objective. The stimulation execution was one of the largest single stage proppant placements for the basin in recent history. The implementation of single mesh proppant for the entire job is a unique deployment for the Region and a novel movement in the global stimulation industry in general, as was the first application of fibres in the North Sea. In addition to the unconventional job design, the Andrew A11z stimulation has become the first proppant fracturing treatment to be executed by BP UK North Sea in twenty-two years. The successful execution and results of this complex project demonstrates how innovative stimulation design, when combined with effective multi-disciplinary team management and guided by aligned priorities adds significant long-term value but can also extend the life of mature offshore assets and instil confidence to pursue many more similar opportunities in such environments that are all too often discarded due to perceived complexity.

AB  - ABSTRACTBefore the deployment of Oscillating Water Column (OWC) devices for commercial ocean energy harvesting, comprehensive studies on the hydrodynamics of the device are essential. CFD modelling allows for a thorough testing of the influence of various parameters on the performance of an OWC device. In the current paper, a two-dimensional numerical wave tank is used to study the interaction of linear waves with an OWC wave energy converter device. Numerical experiments over a range of wave lengths for a certain front wall draught and thickness with different nozzle widths are carried out. Theory of porous media flow is used in addition to the nozzle to simulate external damping. The movement of the free surface inside the device is calculated in two-dimensions to obtain a realistic visualisation of the hydrodynamics inside the device. The hydrodynamic efficiency of the device is used to measure the performance of the device. The impermeability factor used at the nozzle using porous media flow provides results that closely follow the experimental results. The numerical model uses a uniform cartesian staggered computational grid with velocities at the cell edges and pressure at the cell centres. Fluid flow is governed by the Reynolds-Averaged Navier-Stokes equations. A 5th-order conservative finite difference WENO scheme is employed for the discretization of the convective terms. Time discretization is carried out using the 3rd-order TVD Range-Kutta scheme. The projection method is used for pressure discretization and the Poisson equation for pressure is solved using a preconditioned BiCGStab solver. Wave generation and dissipation in the wave tank is carried out by the relaxation method. The level set method, which uses a function that is smooth over the interface, is used to determine the free surface. This provides a sharp interface between water and air in the wave tank enabling the detail in the simulations. The computing performance of the code is increased by parallel processing using the OpenMPI library.

AB  - In this paper, we propose a full finite volume approach to simulate two-phase flows of oil and water in heterogeneous and anisotropic petroleum reservoirs in 2-D. The IMPES procedure is used to solve the coupling between the pressure and the saturation equations. The eliptic pressure equation is discretized by a non-orthodox linear Multi-Point Flux Approximation (MPFA-HD) method capable to handle heterogeneous and highly anisotropic media. Following the MPFA-D (MPFA-Diamond) scheme and some existent non-linear cell centered strategies, the key point in the construction of our scheme is the discretization of the flux across each cell face. First, we construct the one-sided fluxes on each cell independently and then, we integrate both one-sided fluxes over the control surface and finally we express the cell edge fluxes as a convex combination of the one side fluxes, to obtain a unique flux expression. On the other hand, differently from the MPFA-D, in our scheme, fluxes on each cell face are explicitly expressed by one cell centered unknown defined on the cells sharing that face and two auxiliary unknowns defined at two face endpoints that do not necessarily belong to the same face shared by the adjacent cells. These auxiliary vertex unknowns are eliminated by a proper interpolation. To solve the saturation equation, we propose a Modified Flow Oriented Scheme (M-FOS). This flow oriented variant explicitly computes the multidimensional numerical fluxes by using higher order accuracy in space. Besides, for problems with distorted meshes, the proposed formulation takes into account the angular distortion of the computational mesh by means of an adaptive weight, that tunes the multidimensional character of the formulation according to the grid distortion. This strategy diminishes the occurrence of Grid Orientation Effects (GOE). In order to avoid spurious oscillations in higher-order approximations, a recently devised Multidimensional Limiting Process (MLP) is adopted. This strategy guarantees monotone solutions and can be used with any polygonal mesh. Finally, an entropy fix strategy is also employed in order to produce convergent solutions. The performance of our numerical formulation is evaluated by solving some benchmark problems.

AB  - This paper details the results from a comprehensive study to evaluate completion effectiveness and optimize field development in the Utica. Optimizing the number and location of perforation clusters, number of stages, and treatment size requires a clear understanding of how these parameters affect fracture geometry and well productivity. The goal of this work was to determine how the number of perforation clusters per stage and treatment size affect fracture geometry and well productivity, and to integrate these results into the overall field development optimization. A comprehensive evaluation of plug and perf (PNP) and controlled entry point (CEP) completions and treatment size was performed using a five-well pad in the Utica (wet gas area). The evaluation included PNP completions with 3-4 perforation clusters and CEP completions with 1-2 perforation clusters. Treatment size was varied by a factor of two to evaluate the effect of fluid volume on fracture length. Microseismic data were gathered on 81 PNP stages and 95 CEP stages. The microseismic data were used to calibrate hydraulic fracture models. Fracture geometries for the five-well pad plus a direct offset well (a six well total of 250+ stages) were discretely gridded in a reservoir simulation model. The reservoir simulation model was calibrated by history matching 14+ months of production data. Proppant Tracer data and DFIT measurements from previous Utica work were used to support the hydraulic fracture modeling and reservoir simulations. The microseismic data provided a clear understanding of the relationship between treatment size and fracture length for each completion scenario. The results indicate that fracture length may be dependent on completion type, with CEP completions showing less fracture length than PNP completions. Simple production comparisons and detailed reservoir simulation history matching showed that (1) well productivity is governed by the number of perforation clusters, with PNP wells outperforming CEP wells and (2) well-to-well communication is evident. This work did NOT identify any gross inefficiencies with PNP completions and suggests that CEP completions do NOT result in better productivity, at least in this Utica pad. The calibrated models were used to optimize perf cluster spacing, treatment size, and well spacing for PNP completions. The optimization results are summarized in the paper, but the focus of the paper is the evaluation of PNP and CEP completions, characterization of hydraulic fracture length-volume relationships, and calibration of hydraulic fracture and reservoir simulation models.

AB  - Abstract The application of artificial lift in deepwater environments is constantly evolving due to a growing need for more sophisticated and robust completions that improve run-life expectancy and reliable deployment. The downtime associated with disruption of functionality while lowering a completion string in the well or dealing with a string stuck in hole can be a major concern because it can lead to an expensive workover or even well loss when fishing operations are unsuccessful. Because of this, most oil producer companies complete their wells only with field-proven or stringently qualified tools. That is the case of two subsea wells recently completed in the Atlanta field (14°API oil) with an electrical submersible pump (ESP) in more than 1,550 m water depth. What makes the two initial wells unique to date are the large capsules (OD and length), high-power ESP and technology used to protect the lines going downhole. In the heart of each capsule there is a 1,500 HP ESP unit capable of pumping 12,000 bbl/d of viscous oil. Deploying such large systems inside 9?-in. capsules was already a great achievement. Nevertheless, the biggest challenge was to deal with the lines (two chemical injection, reservoir monitoring and hydraulic control) that had to go deeper than the ESP system. Even with the use of clamps, passing these lines outside of the capsule imposes a high risk of damaging them in the well's horizontal section or getting them stuck if the lines broke and wrapped between the capsule OD and the casing. Overcoming this risk was possible through the implementation of a breakthrough idea that consisted in closing the bottom end of the 9?-in. capsule with a hydraulic retrievable packer instead of a torqued crossover, as is usually done in ESP capsules. The packer has the advantage that setting it doesn't create any relative movement of the feedthrough lines with respect to the capsule body, so all lines that must go deeper pass through without damage during closure of the capsule's bottom end. Splice subs above and below the packer make it even easier to pre-install the lines before shipping offshore. Assembly was a breeze and the capsules were successfully pressure-tested to confirm there was no leakage before installing them in 11¾-in., 60.7-lb/ft casing at an inclination angle of 75°. All lines were commissioned and proven functional after finishing the completion job. These are the largest ESP capsules successfully installed in-well in Brazil and probably in the world with feedthrough lines crossing and protected inside the capsule. The creative concept can be extended to other wells and is very valuable to manage the risk of damaging the lines in ESP capsules.

AB  - Abstract Well Integrity management standards require wells to be equipped with two independent barriers to protect against uncontrolled flow of hydrocarbons from the reservoir to the environment. For producing wells the two barriers are usually the downhole safety valve and the surface X-mas tree. I-DHSVC is integral solution, implemented 1st time in region, for wells suffering from damaged DHSV landing nipple profile. Damage could be related to lock profile, seal bore profile or both. It's a perfect solution for the wells with damaged DHSV landing nipple but with integral control line. Sometimes, DHSV cannot be stay in the landing nipple due to damaged lock profile, causing it to pop up during the production. This situation leads to high risk scenario (risk rank-1). IDHSVC does not use damaged nipple profile for anchoring as its slips anchor in the flow coupling above & below the landing nipple. A standard DHSV is connected to bottom of IDHSVC, which sets by either Slick line or by E-wireline utilizing nitrogen charged hydraulic setting tool. DHSV can be operated normally using existing control line. IDHSVC can be retrieved utilizing slick line with GS pulling tool without any Barge/Rig. The benefits from the project are sustained "year-on-year" with the restoration of full integrity to the wells which enables ADMA-OPCO to meet its production targets in a cost effective manner.

AB  - Abstract Abu Dhabi fields are influenced by strike-slip and their damage zones as a main tectonic regime. A damage zone is the deformed volume of rocks around a fault surface that results from the initiation, propagation, interaction, and build-up of slip along fault segments. These damages zones impacted the distribution of the traps, migration pathways and increasing the drilling risks. Slippage and rotation along the fault segments in Abu Dhabi fields increases the damage zones widths around the fault segments. This paper presents a detailed description of the kinematics and dynamics of rotated damage zones in the strike-slip faults of Abu Dhabi fields. The factors that are controlling the damage zones around faults are mainly the rock type, relation between bedding and fault plane and stress tensors. This paper, however, focuses on the structures within the damage zones as they are influencing the trapping mechanism, the drilling hazards and how the rotation increases these. In addition, the structures formed at the fault tips are also considered, especially for the initiation and propagation of the fractures. Field examples and outcrop analogues of damage zones around strike-slip faults are presented. This study is integration between seismic, cores, logs, and outcrops. During the Late Cretaceous the kinematics of Abu Dhabi fault system changed to transtensional and accommodated a major component of left-lateral strike-slip motion with a SE-NW compressional component. The final phase occurred by the Miocene time, where the stress tensor is changed to NE-SW compression, which rotated the blocks. During this deformation, the blocks were dissected into a series of large-scale blocks bounded by NW-trending left-lateral strike-slip faults which merge into a NE–SW fault system that forms the main structures in Abu Dhabi. Field studies on the mountains exposures data from the fault bound subsurface blocks indicate 10°–15° of post-Early Miocene anticlockwise rotation with substantial latitudinal motion. The decrease/increase of stresses along the fault segments in the overlapping/linkage zones and at the fault tips under differential confining pressures affecting the rocks behavior and understanding of these will greatly avoid drilling dry holes and reduce the drilling risks.

AB  - Abstract This study proposed the reliability analysis of a wellhead platform in Al Shaheen Block 5 Project. The reliability, optimal maintenance period, and appropriate redundancy policy were acquired by taking the failure rate of each component and methods from OREDA and PDS. The PDS is a method used to quantify the reliability of computer-based control and safety systems. The probability of failure on demand (PFD) was estimated for each safety function. The safety integrity level (SIL) of the overall system was evaluated to quantify failure risks. The SIL evaluation was applied to judging whether the reliability of process shutdown (PSD) functions of the present system was properly configured. In particular, the shutdown functions of the flare system and well isolation satisfied the minimum SIL requirement by IEC general recommendation. Introduction The Al Shaheen Oilfield is located in the Arabian Gulf, approximately 70km offshore northeast of the Qatar Peninsula. Hyundai Heavy Industries (HHI) has been awarded a contract for the Engineering, Procurement, Construction and Commissioning (EPCC) of a number of new platforms and additional facilities, by Maersk Oil Qatar (MOQ). This study gives a detailed risk assessment of the high liquid level shutdown to prevent liquid carryover to the flare stack in Block 5 Development Project. The overall system consists of two sub-systems equipped with safety instrumentation: one concerning the Production Wellheads with isolation valves, and the other concerning the Wellhead Platform with the Inlet Separator, Test Separator, and HP Flare K.O. Drum. Depending on the field development phase and operating philosophy, the number of working Production Wellhead varies up to 30. The HP Flare K.O. Drum is not designed to receive the total liquid flow from Inlet or Test Separators. This situation has raised a concern whether the safety instrumentation of the Wellhead Platform is of sufficient integrity. To analyze the reliability of the issued system, the functional boundaries are first defined in consideration of the design and operational philosophy. The reliability block diagram (RBD) is used to represent the system configuration. The failure rates of the overall instrumentation and equipment are obtained from the surrogated data such as OREDA and PDS. The SIL requirement by IEC is employed as the safety level determining the system integrity. Safety Integrity Level Assessment Safety functions and safety integrity level In the IEC standards, a safety function is considered as a function to be implemented in order to achieve a specified risk reduction related to a hazardous event. A safety function is thus specified in terms of the action to be taken and the required probability to successfully carry out this action. This probability is also referred to as the safety integrity, and in the context of IEC 61508 the safety integrity is classified to discrete levels as indicated in Table 1.

AB  - Critical components in the study and improvement of ship survivability include the vulnerability of a ship to the impact of an underwater explosion (UNDEX) and how to incorporate this factor into early-stage ship design. When simulating surface ship early-time far-field UNDEX, the Finite Element Method (FEM) may be used to model shock wave propagation and cavitation in the fluid. This is a computationally intensive task, however, due to the large size of the fluid domain which typically requires several million degrees of freedom (DOF) in the mesh. The task is further complicated by the need to generate the fluid mesh around the irregular ship hull geometry. Ship design concept exploration requires fast simulation with minimal or no manual intervention in the mesh generation. The high-order Spectral Element Method (SEM) has proven to be a more accurate replacement for linear FEM in UNDEX modeling, but is restricted to using hexahedral elements in 3D. Therefore, the fast, automated application of the SEM in the surface ship UNDEX problem is hindered by the need to generate an effective and efficient unstructured hexahedral mesh. The research described in this paper assesses a mesh-first, automatic, all-hexahedral mesh generation scheme that provides excellent early-time UNDEX simulation results with only minimal compromise in the boundary geometry accuracy. The resulting fluid mesh is used with linear and high-order SEM elements and results are compared to an all-tetrahedral mesh generated by an automatic Delaunay refinement algorithm with linear FEM elements. The comparison is performed for both Total Field and Scattered Field Finite and Spectral Element Cavitating Acoustic fluid models. The goal of this study is to provide a method of modeling the fluid domain in early-time far-field UNDEX with sufficient efficiency and minimal mesh generation effort.

AB  - Abstract In recent years, complex well explorations have moved into more challenging environments (ultra-deep, high-pressure/high-temperature (HPHT), extended reach laterals). These environments require a closely integrated and multidisciplinary process to ensure efficiency and mitigate risk. In particular, the process of perforating has called for careful design, planning and execution to prevent costly failures and maximize productivity over the life of the well. The perforating systems used in these environments can place a large dynamic load on downhole equipment. Predicting the magnitude and transient behavior of such loads is a critical step in developing completion designs that can be executed safely while avoiding damage or destruction to downhole tool strings and production equipment. Further, post-job well production rates often depend strongly on the proper choice of perforating job design parameters relating to formation integrity, tunnel cleanup, underbalance management, subsequent stimulation methods, etc. Predicting the complex interdependencies between these parameters is crucial for a successful job. The simulation software presented in this work is based on a next-generation, dynamic downhole modeling platform that simulates the dynamic response of a cased or uncased wellbore, its contents, and the porous rock formation to the energy released by gas-generating and stored pressure sources. The software is applied to predict dynamic flow around the wellbore/formation, evaluate cleanup and mitigate gun shock loads. For complex well completions, the software incorporates differentiating algorithms for shock-capturing hydrodynamic solvers, improved thermodynamic closure, fluid dynamics and more importantly, significantly faster turnaround simulation times to enable quick pre-job modeling iterations. The software is comprehensively validated using a variety of benchmarking examples. The improvements in dynamic predictions as well as computational efficiencies with the next-generation software are clearly demonstrated. Beyond standard benchmark cases, the application of this software is demonstrated using successful design examples from wells in the North Sea, Southeast Asia, etc. The simulations presented here provide insight into the complex fluid dynamics between the formation and wellbore, gun shock loads, and how cleanup is maximized and productivity enhanced by subsequent optimization of wellbore/gun systems. In an environment where downhole measurements or laboratory-based testing is impractical, the dynamic modeling software ensures successful execution through pre-job modeling as well as conducting a comprehensive post-job analysis for future planning.

AB  - Abstract The construction of drilling and production facilities for gas lift production and injection wells on artificial Islands provides a significant exposure to risk due to SIMOPS. Specifically, simultaneous drilling operations results in rig skidding operations over/near to live well cellars and production line trenches. This increases the risk of venting significant lift gas volumes to atmosphere in a manned area through dropped objects or other failures. The authors describe a Lift Gas Safety System (LGSS) to be implemented that will prevent venting lift gas during both a dropped object and other unplanned incidents leading to loss of integrity (e.g. ESD). The system also provides benefits through improved annular pressure monitoring (APM) and confining barriers within the wellhead. Outlined is the implementation process by which the system was selected and which subsequently led to optimization of surface facilities from the well cellars through to the production manifold.

AB  - Abstract Fracture stimulation has been adopted as an integral part of the completion inthe M'Boundi field given the results achieved in enhancing well productivity,as well as the positive impact realized on field development economics. Thefracturing process has been optimized over the years through improved reservoirunderstanding and ensuing implementation of technologies to address theuncovered challenges. Changes to the fracturing fluid formulation to preventdamaging the water sensitive reservoir rock, as well as modified proppantschedules to mitigate proppant embedment are examples of this improvementprocess. This paper describes the successful ongoing process of optimizing hydraulicfracturing designs in M'Boundi field. By applying an integrated approachcombining various technologies, it was possible to better understand fracturepropagation and coverage of the target reservoir. Implementation of a novelnon-radioactive traceable proppant allowed accurate frac height measurement atthe wellbore. When combined with rocks mechanics derived from sonic logs it ledto redefining the mechanical earth model and ultimately the completion andfracturing strategy in the field. The process will be illustrated with examplesfrom a 3-well campaign recently executed onshore Congo.

AB  - ABSTRACTIn this study, a two-step oil spill forecasting system is developed. In the first step, once the volume and properties of the spilled oil were known, the initial oil spill area and the successive diffused area were estimated using empirical formulas. The oil slick trajectories were then determined using the vectorial summation of the velocity of the ocean current and 3% of the wind speed. A land-based X-band radar was temporarily deployed to obtain the local current velocities during the oil spill event. In the second step, according to the given current and wind fields, the Semi-implicit Cross-scale Hydroscience Integrated System Model (SCHISM) was applied to forecast the location and area of the oil spill.INTRODUCTIONOil spill events in coastal areas, harbors, and rivers are usually caused by the grounding of ships and the oil pipeline cracks. Oil spills in coastal areas often have critical impacts on marine ecosystems and economic activity. Once oil is spilled, it undergoes various physical, chemical, and biological processes that begin to transform the oil in the ocean. In addition, oil characteristics, oceanic hydrodynamics, and meteorological and coastal environmental conditions affect the transport and fate of oil spill in coastal areas.Preventing the impact of oil spills on coastal areas and the marine environment is the most critical concern in the world. Numerous medium (7-700 tons) and large (>700 tons) spills have been caused by tankers during each decade of 1970-2015 (ITOPF, 2016). Small and medium spills accounted for 95% of all the recorded incidents, and a large percentage of these spills, 40%, and 29%, respectively, were recorded during 1974-2015.The East Asia shipping routes pass through Taiwan, and rapid economic development has enabled the development of Taiwan’s foreign shipping industry. In particular, both exports and imports of oil products have increased because of the rapid development of Taiwan’s petrochemical industry. However, this has led to an increased uncertainty in harbor environmental management. For example, the container ship TS Taipei split into two parts during a northeast monsoon weather after grounding one nautical mile off Shimen in northern Taiwan. The oil slick fouled more than 2 km of coastline, according to the Taiwan Environmental Protection Agency reports.

AB  - Summary The performance of many waterfloods [and enhanced-oil-recovery (EOR) schemes] is characterized by fluid injection under fracturing conditions. Especially when the geology is complex and the mobility of the reservoir is low, induced fractures can be of the same order as the well spacing, which has a significant (in general undesired) impact on both areal sweep and vertical conformance. Therefore, fluid injection needs to be actively managed and surveyed in order to design an appropriate injection strategy over time. We have analyzed historical injection/production-test, injection step-rate-test, and falloff (FO) test (FOT) data of an existing complex waterflood in the Pierce field, North Sea. The mental subsurface model that emerged from this data analysis was developed further through a series of dynamic fracture-propagation simulations. While the data analysis was a relatively standard procedure, the fracture-modeling part was far from trivial and included simulations using a standalone fracture modeling tool and a more sophisticated coupled dynamic fracture-propagation reservoir simulator, both being in-house software tools. The combined analysis was used to develop a better understanding of the waterflood performance. The main improvement compared to previous work was the integration of the data analysis and the dynamic modeling work rather than looking at each data source individually. In combination, a consistent explanation of the observed reservoir behavior was achieved. This has resulted in changes in the day-to-day water injection management and is expected to play a key role in longer-term development strategies.

AB  - AbstractNMR logs taken over hydrocarbon intervals show significant differences with routine core data. Ideally, one should do laboratory NMR at full reservoir conditions, which is very expensive. As an alternative, we propose that the same can be modeled, starting from routine NMR on core, and estimated values of oil properties and saturation. The advantage of this approach is that changes in these estimates can easily be made. The modeled NMR response is then used to calibrate interpretations such as bound water, permeability and capillarity.Another new concept is a variable, rather than a fixed, T2cutoff for the prediction of bound water from the NMR log. In-situ modeling was also used to calibrate this cutoff against features of the actual log.We show that the actual log response is faithfully predicted by our modeling for two wells in the Valdemar area. Well A was drilled with water-based mud (WBM) and logged with a wireline NMR tool, and Well B was drilled with oil-based mud (OBM) and logged with an LWD NM tool.The results compare generally well with the resistivity derived saturation, but local deviations are found. Similarly, permeability correlations calibrated to in-situ conditions produced values that compare favorably with core data where available. Pseudo-capillary-pressure curves computed from the NMR log, using calibration against available core data, were used to locate the free-water level (FWL). Wettability was assessed from the shift of the oil-relaxation time away from its predicted bulk value under reservoir conditions. The reservoir appears to be strongly water-wet.

AB  - Abstract Effective management of subsea assets requires diligent focus on key performance areas such as productivity improvement, hydrocarbon recovery efficiency, production preservation, and well integrity. Common to all of these key areas is a need to perform periodic interventions on the asset's subsea wells to carry out performance-critical work, e.g., well servicing/repair, production enhancement, reserve additions, and surveillance. Well intervention services on subsea wells have been conventionally performed using large and expensive Mobile Offshore Drilling Units (MODUs). In the North Sea, ship-based light well intervention (LWI) services offer a lower cost solution to conventional MODU based intervention services by using dynamic positioning over the wells and deploying a subsea BOP stack plus fixed-length lubricator that connects as a selfcontained unit to the subsea tree. Tools are conveyed on wireline/slickline from the vessel through the open sea into the selfcontained subsea lubricator/BOP stack. While these LWI services are lower cost, there are more physical and functional limitations that can result in additional technical challenges. One such challenge was encountered when ExxonMobil was evaluating its first LWI on a 5-1/8" x 2" spool/horizontal tree. The target was to pressure test the full TRT/BOP/lubricator stack-up, deploy the pressure tested system as a single unit, and establish hydraulic control of the tree such that separate emergency disconnect devices were not required beyond what was integral to the vessel's proven BOP/lubricator equipment. To achieve this end, ExxonMobil performed quantitative risk analysis on three viable equipment stack-up configurations to determine the safest and lowest cost approach for connecting to its spool/horizontal tree while honoring the 44 ton lifting limits of the particular LWI vessel. The results of this analysis showed that the equipment configuration that was statistically the safest was also the simplest and lowest cost option. Based on the analysis, ExxonMobil modified an 18-3/4" hub style connector for connection between the subsea tree and the vessel's BOP/lubricator and developed a flying stab plate deployment approach, with umbilical slack management, to facilitate stabplate make-up for hydraulic tree control from the vessel. The flying stabplate umbilical leveraged the vessel's BOP/lubricator emergency disconnect to further simplify the system and improve safety. The system has been used twice since development and both deployments were successful. Introduction ExxonMobil Production Company's UK affiliate in the North Sea, Mobil North Sea LLC (MNSL), operates both platform and subsea wells in the Beryl development area. The Beryl Field is located in Block 9/13a of the UK Sector of the North Sea approximately 185 miles (300 km) north-east of Aberdeen. The field was discovered in May 1972, and oil production began in June 1976. The Beryl area includes two manned platforms (Beryl Alpha and Beryl Bravo), two not normally manned Single Point Moorings, and a number of subsea clusters/wells (see Figure 1). The satellite developments shown in Figure 1 are comprised of a mixture of spool/horizontal trees and dual-bore/vertical trees that are tied back to the platforms for gas-lift supply, water injection, and hydrocarbon production. Approximately 40% of the subsea trees are spool/horizontal trees and 60% are dual-bore/vertical trees. Water depths typically range between 350-400 feet with an average reservoir depth of 11,000 feet. The subsea assets currently have 21 active producers that contribute approximately half of the Beryl area production.

AB  - Abstract A common cause of failure with Surface-Controlled Sub-Surface Safety Valves (SC-SSSV) is a defect in the downhole hydraulic line, which controls the valve from surface. Such a failure (Control-Line (CL) leaking or plugged) generates production losses and requires the intervention of a costly workover rig - usually not immediately available. A large number of wells have been closed in due to CL problems. This paper presents a pilot test of a "control-line free?? Wireline-Retrievable (WR) SC-SSSV concept, which replaced a conventional Subsurface Safety Valve and maintained the well producing under surface controlled conditions without the need for a work over or wellhead modifications. A Wire line retrievable, flapper type self-equalizing Safety Valve has been interfaced with an HPU (Hydraulic Power Unit) and downhole electronics, which are operated by an electromagnetic signal transmitted from surface through the formation and using the conductivity of the tubing. The surface emitter continuously sends a signal (low frequency) to the SC-SSSV. As the system is designed to be fail-safe, the normally-closed valve remains open while receiving the signal and closes as soon as the signal is lost. This control line free SC-SSSV can be set in any landing nipple profile. It has been installed by normal wire line operation in active onshore oil producing well for three months using a standard SC-SSSV lock mandrel. 25 periodic functional tests consisting of closing the valve and bleeding down the tubing pressure to confirm the integrity of the well pressure containment below the closed valve were performed for validation. The primary application is to secure wells with a damaged CL or wells completed without any SC-SSSV. It provides an immediate cost-effective solution - allowing production to resume with a surface-controllable safety barrier while avoiding or postponing an expensive work over. The pilot test has been successfully carried out over the 90 day period in a harsh environment onshore well usually equipped with SC-SSSV. The wellhead was fitted with two sensors: one pressure transducer on the flow line and one temperature probe connected to the surface emitter (for fire hazard detection) to act as temporary ESD for this test. Adjustable thresholds were set to switch off the surface emitter and shut-in the well in the event of any anomalies. Two unplanned events occurred during the 90 days pilot test: a temperature probe breakdown and a surface antenna disconnection. In both cases, the EM-signal was interrupted and the SC-SSSV closed and secured the well. Temporary solutions, such as the normally-open velocity or ambient valves, can be considered according to current safety policy but lacks ability to be connected to an emergency shut down system. The Electromagnetic "control line free?? SC-SSSV provides an effective and reliable surface controlled solution in the event of control line failure, or lack of hydraulic control system, on a standard SC-SSSV installation tied in to an existing emergency shut down system. This breakthrough wireline product has proven to be easy to install and offers new possibilities for managing in a safe and effective manners the unexpected failures of hydraulic SC-SSSV.

AB  - A/S Norske Shell needed to carry out tubing hanger crown plug (THCP) removal from a riserless light well intervention (RLWI) vessel in the Norwegian sector of the North Sea. There were concerns that the conventional application of mechanical jarring with slickline tools could not be used due to the combination of deep water and high sea currents in the specific field. A safer, more controlled and assured method was needed to withstand this extreme environment and provide the certainty of task success. Theoretical studies and practical testing were conducted at the supplier's test site to verify the impact sea current had on cables and toolstring assemblies. Different scenarios were analysed and the most effective and lowest cost solution was determined. An electric line deployed and powered electrohydraulic stroker device was selected, which did not require any cable actuation to generate the pull forces required to unseat the crown plug. Toolstring space-out was critical to ensure the stroker anchor was above and clear of the well control package (WCP) and positioned to prevent any inadvertent damage to the lubricator. In addition, a release tool and a shearable stem provided back-up safety capability for well control. A modification to an existing stroker was designed and a prototype built and tested at the onshore facility. The final stroker toolstring design was tested out successfully on a more benign shallow subsea well, where the highly accurate force and movement control of the stroker, coupled with real-time surface readout, enabled a safe and secure crown plug pulling and installation operation. The targeted operation in a deep-water, high-sea current environment was then carried out successfully, applying many lessons learned and process improvements from the trial well. In conclusion, the use of electrohydraulic stroker technology was proved to be a viable alternative for crown plug retrieval and setting operations, whilst bringing heightened visibility and control to such an operation.

AB  - AbstractEfficiency and economics have motivated RasGas Trains 3-5 to implement a novel compressor-driver arrangement comprising both propane and mixed refrigerant (MR) compressors on a single shaft.One Frame 7E gas turbine drives the LP and MP MR compressors while a second Frame 7E drives the propane and HP MR machines.With minor control system adjustments after startup, the refrigerant compressors in RasGas Train 3 are operating reliably.IntroductionThe propane precooled mixed refrigerant (C3MR) process developed by Air Products has been the dominant process technology employed in the LNG industry for over 30 years.This process uses a propane refrigerant system to chill the feed gas from ambient temperature to about -33oC and a mixed component refrigerant (MR) to chill the gas to LNG temperatures.Because pure propane is used in the precooling refrigeration cycle, the minimum temperature of this cycle is limited to the boiling temperature of propane near atmospheric pressure.The total duty that can be transferred to the propane refrigerant is thereby naturally limited to heat that can be transferred within this range.Because of the propane's limited temperature range, one of the characteristics of the C3MR process arrangement is that the MR refrigeration system requires nearly double the compression power of the propane refrigeration system.The actual difference depends on the number of propane stages, the ambient conditions, the environmental cooling medium, and other process arrangements.To drive these refrigeration compressors, early LNG plants used steam turbines that could be sized to fit the required service (e.g. Marsa el Brega).Later projects determined that gas turbines drivers were a more efficient and less costly option for driving the compressors.For procurement, maintainability and sparing purposes, an operating facility would prefer to have each of the compression services driven by the same type and model of gas turbine driver.For the C3MR process, such an arrangement is typically inconvenient due to the inherent power consumption mismatch between the propane and MR services.

AB  - ABSTRACT A three-dimensional numerical study has been undertaken to investigate the interactions of steep focused wave and a vertical circular cylinder. The large-eddy simulation approach has been adopted in this study, where the model is based on the filtered Navier–Stokes equations with the dynamic Smagorinsky sub-grid model being used for the unresolved scales of turbulence. The governing equations have been discretised using the finite volume method, with the air–water interface being captured using a volume of fluid method and the cut cell method being implemented to deal with complex geometry in the Cartesian grid. Numerical results are presented and compared with the available experimental measurements in terms of the wave elevations and pressure on the cylinder. Detailed free surface profile during wave impact are shown and discussed. INTRODUCTION It is noticed that extreme waves will become more common in coastal and offshore region due to the impact of climate change. Wavestructure interaction is a key aspect in the safe and cost-effective design of coastal and offshore structures, and marine renewable devices. Monopile structures are among the most common types of installations for coastal and offshore applications. It is required to develop tools for assessing the reliability and survivability of these structures in presence of extreme loads, such as those applied by focusing waves (Yan, et al., 2015). In order to roughly predict the hydrodynamic loads on structures, the Morison equation and potential flow theory (Ma, et al., 2015) have been widely used in the literatures. However, it is challenged to consider wave impact on the structures by using these two approaches during wave breaking, especially when there are splash-up and air entrainment. With developments of CFD (computational fluid dynamics) and increases in computer power, recent models for studying wavestructure interaction, solve the Navier–Stokes equations coupled with a free surface calculation (Lin, 2008). Several methods have been developed by solving Navier-Stokes model on a fixed grid by using the volume of fluid method (Lin & Liu, 1998; Xie, 2012; Xie, 2015), the level set method (Christou, et al., 2020), particle in cell method (Chen, et al., 2018), height function method (Ai, et al., 2019) and two-fluid coupled with cut-cell method (Qian, et al., 2006). Numerical model has also been developed with adaptive mesh method to reduce the computational effort without scarifying the accuracy (Xie, et al., 2017). Many researchers have employed the open source code OpenFOAM to study focusing waves (Chen, et al., 2014; Hu, et al., 2016; Martínez Ferrer, et al., 2016; Ransley, et al., 2019), Alternatively, there are also some meshless methods, such as the smoothed particle hydrodynamics (SPH) (Lind, et al., 2012) and the meshless local Petrov-Galerkin (MLPG_R) method (Ma, 2005).

AB  - Abstract The HPHT well, A-16A, was planned to test a certain part of the Kvitebjørn field in the North Sea for hydrocarbons in order to prove sufficient reserves to justify a field development. Drilling fluid selection and optimization in the planning phase was considered to be one of the key factors to be able to drill the pilot slim hole section through the Deco/Brent and Cook formations which brought challenges above the standard Kvitebjørn wells due to the risk of high depletion combined with high initial pressure. The well was planned with a pilot hole, A-16, in order to test the drillability of the overlying strata and prove the absence of highly depleted sand formations. It was important to penetrate all possible depleted zones in the pilot well to verify that sidetrack can be drilled to produce from the Statfjord target. Oil based drilling fluid weighted with treated micronized barite (OB TMB) together with a wellbore strengthening approach was successfully implemented to achieve the pilot well goals. Managed pressure drilling (MPD) and rig assist snubbing (RAS) equipment were rigged up and the 5 ¾-in pilot section was drilled through a 7-in temporary upper completion (TTRD) set in 9 7/8-in casing. MPD and RAS technologies were used in order to control the bottomhole pressure accurately and to ensure that the additional two barriers were maintained in the well at all times, even if the primary fluid barrier was lost due to crossflow. The paper provides detail about the drilling fluid planning and execution for the pilot slim hole section; this includes the fluid design and work performed to select and optimize wellbore strengthening materials (WSM) package. The WSM package was optimized by sophisticated, formation fractured, laboratory tests based on the fracture size estimated by proprietary software. Initial formation losses observed while drilling were cured with the particles kept continuously in the fluid, which eliminated the use of extra lost circulation material (LCM) pills or cement slurries. The section was then drilled with more than 500 bar (7252 psi) hydrostatic overbalance (including MPD back pressure), with no further formation losses and without differential sticking incidents while taking pressure points in the extremely depleted zones. The interval was drilled through extremely depleted formations with the highest overbalance drilling in the operator's experience. Superior integrity of the WSM prevented losses and minimized fluid treatments; this reduced the overall costs with minimal logistics. Low density (~1.5 specific gravity) WSM prevented particle settling in the well or in the drillstring and within the surface equipment, which proved the reliability of the design for MPD sections.

AB  - ABSTRACTWhile exploring for Jurassic hydrocarbons in Shushan Basin, North Western Desert, Egypt, Partial or complete reservoir substitutions, alteration by volcanic, volcaniclastic deposits have led to a number of unsuccessful wells. It is therefore essential to understand the distribution and geometry of volcanics in the vicinity of the Jurassic reservoirs. Many wells have been drilled and the presence of volcanic rocks were not recognized for more than a decade. The Qasr NE -2X well was the first alert that volcanic rocks occur in the Jurassic section. This paper shows detailed integration between spectral GR, triple combo, spectroscopy and image logs were necessary to define and differentiate between volcanic rocks of similar composition or alteration from similar host rocks. The lithostratigraphic cross sections and thickness variations of Jurassic volcanics are discussed in order to distinguish the shape and the extent of the volcanics, but the key is to be able to recognize the volcanics away from well control. The results showed that the emplacement of Jurassic volcanic rocks were from extrusive volcanic events. Thin section and log response of olivine basalt and tuffaceous caps strongly suggest sub-aerial effusive eruption. The identification of volcanic rocks using 3D seismic data is critical from a prospecting point of view. If we are unable to see the volcanic seismic signature we cannot predict their presence. If the volcanic rocks as described above vary from tuffs, altered basalts to un-altered basalts then the resultant reflection coefficients will also vary and in some cases will be similar to the sedimentary country rocks. Other factors with regard to seismic imaging of variable volcanic rocks are thickness, spatial distribution, and seismic data quality. We are studying the response of volcanic rock types using VSP data and well based synthetics and some results are described in this paper. A number of seismic attributes were evaluated including AVO modeling.

AB  - An inviscid model for a ship with a viscous wake is developed. The wake is considered as a region of vorticity trailing behind the ship. The problem is systematically linearized by the use of a perturbation parameter representing the beam-to-length ratio. To first order it is found that the complete velocity potential is composed of two parts. The first is identical to the well-known solution for a thin ship without a wake. The second is the result of the specified vorticity distribution in the wake acting in the absence of the ship. The wake potential is determined for a semi-infinite, U-shaped vortex sheet. The wave resistance for a thin ship with a vortex sheet wake is analytically determined. The results clearly indicate the influence of the wake and its interactions with the ship. Numerical computations are presented for a mathematical form. They show that the wake-wave resistance is about 1 0 percent of the ship-wave resistance. The interaction term may be positive or negative depending on the wake attachment point. A comparison with experimental data is made. It is found that the present type of rotational wake model can account for the differences between Michell’s integral and experiments for the mathematical form.

AB  - ABSTRACT: NMR logs taken in two wells, drilled with water-based mud and oil-based mud, respectively, have been interpreted by modeling the NMR response at in-situ conditions. The main results are confirmation of permeability and saturation estimation and assessment that the rock is waterwet. In addition, a persistent peak at short T2 could be identified as an artifact rather than as due to clay. In-situ modeling was used to calibrate a variable T2- cutoff for the prediction of bound water from the NMR log. We show that the actual log response is faithfully predicted by our modeling for two wells in the Valdemar area. Well A was drilled with water-base mud and logged with a wireline NMR tool, and Well B was drilled with oil-base mud and logged while drilling. The results compare generally well with the resistivity derived saturation, but local deviations are found. Similarly, permeability correlations calibrated to in-situ conditions, produced values that compare favorably with core data where available. Pseudo capcurves computed from the NMR log, using calibration against available core data, were used to locate the FWL. Wettability was assessed from the shift of the oil relaxation time away from its predicted bulk value under reservoir conditions. The reservoir appears to be strongly waterwet. INTRODUCTION It is well known that interpretation of NMR logs on the basis of core-derived parameters often fails because the down-hole situation is much different from that in the laboratory. The largest difference is usually caused by the presence of hydrocarbons (at some remaining saturation). In addition to this, logging tools always measure in an inhomogeneous magnetic field, which may introduce diffusion effects. Core measurements at full in-situ conditions are in principle possible, but very expensive and therefore bound to span a limited range of properties.

AB  - AbstractPressure and fluid data acquired during the Pressure and fluid data acquired during the exploration and appraisal of the Wanaea and Cossack oilfields revealed unexpected anomalies that could not immediately be explained. A multidisciplinary team was established to examine all the data in order to formulate an appropriate geological model and to assess the implications for the proposed development of these fields. The weight of evidence supported a model involving a dynamic aquifer. IntroductionThe objective of this paper is to illustrate by example the effectiveness of integrating all the geological, geophysical, petrophysical and reservoir engineering data in order to develop appropriate geological models. A coordinated multidisciplinary team can evaluate ideas and concepts which may be misinterpreted by individual disciplines, and achieve a much better understanding of the implications of the various models for development decisions. The particular example given here is the aquifer study for Wood side's first two major oil discoveries, the Wanaea and Cossack fields (Figure 1). To date three wells have been drilled on the Wanaea structure and one on Cossack. A detailed account of the background to the discoveries has been previously documented by Woodside 1. Following the Wanaea -1 oil discovery in July 1989, an in-house geological review of the Tithonian aquifer in the northeastern Dampier Sub-basin was undertaken in order to ascertain the likely level of aquifer support available to the Wanaea field and the Angel gas field, situated 11 km to the northeast. This review concluded that the aquifer properties and aquifer-to-field size ratios were such that strong aquifer support could be expected for both fields. In January 1990, the Cossack -1 well was drilled to test a separate culmination between Wanaea and Angel, resulting in a further oil discovery. The oil-water contact was found to be 18 metres deeper than in Wanaea -1. In addition, aquifer pressures measured by the RFT were found to be pressures measured by the RFT were found to be some 8 psi lower, raising the possibility of restricted aquifer communication between the accumulations. The PVT and fluid contact data also appeared to conflict with the established charge and entrapment model. Similarly, small differences in aquifer pressure were observed between Wanaea -1 and Wanaea -2, drilled 3.2 kilometres southwest of the discovery well. The drilling of Wanaea -3, 2.17 km northeast of Wanaea -1, confirmed a variation in oil/water contacts related to variable aquifer pressures. pressures. P. 615

AB  - Summary Liquid loading is a challenging issue in most mature gas fields. The dynamic interaction between wellbore and reservoir when liquid loading happens cannot be comprehensively simulated by a single wellbore simulator or a single reservoir simulator. In this paper, we develop a fully implicitly coupled wellbore/reservoir model to characterize the flow transients in liquid-loaded horizontal gas wells. We fully couple a wellbore model with an in-house reservoir simulator based on the control-volume finite-difference method. Wellbore transient material-balance equations and mixture momentum-balance equations are solved simultaneously with the reservoir equations to obtain pressure, mixture velocity, and phase holdup in each wellbore segment. Also, we propose a modified drift-flux model that is capable of predicting the flow-regime transition for different pipe inclinations from vertical to horizontal. The modified drift-flux model is integrated in the coupled wellbore/reservoir simulator to characterize the two-phase flow in horizontal wellbores. We validate the coupled wellbore/reservoir model with a commercial multisegment wellbore (MSW)/reservoir simulator. The revised drift-flux formulation not only matches a commercial simulator in production forecast and wellbore pressure, but also predicts the subsequent unstable liquid production caused by flow-regime transitions. For a synthetic field-scale case, the new model predicts gas production that lasts 23 days longer than the prediction of a commercial simulator. This paper extends the capability of a fully implicitly coupled wellbore/reservoir simulator to simulate the transient liquid-loading phenomenon. The model can serve as a promising tool for gasfield development.

AB  - Complications with Stress Tests - Insights from a fracture experiment in the ultra-deep KTB borehole.SummaryIn the main KTB-well (Kontinentales Tiefbohrprogramm der Bundesrepublik Deutschland), we pumped 210 m3 of brine to make a hydraulic fracturing stress measurement and to induce seismic events. We observed a peculiar pressure behavior: a clear breakdown occurred at low flow rate, but at higher flow rate the pressure kept rising until we reached the pressure limit. During the later injection stages, a large number of triggered seismic events occurred. The events mostly came from faults at a depth of 8.6 and 8.9 km, whereas the fluid was injected at 9.1 km depth. A few events came from faults as shallow as 7.2 km. Careful analysis of the pressure record showed that no tensile fracture was created. The seismic events indicated that the injected fluid was most probably going into pre-existing shear faults.IntroductionCreating a hydraulic fracture and observing the closure pressure of the fracture provides by far the most direct and reliable way to measure in-situ stress at great depth (Ref. 1). However, the interpretation of hydraulic fracture closure rests on the assumption that a dominant tensile fracture is induced perpendicular to the least stress (Ref. 2). In reality, complex fracture geometry may hamper interpretation of stress tests. Instead of a single fracture, we may induce a very tortuous fracture or inject fluid into shear faults. We present evidence for such behavior in a hydraulic fracturing experiment at 9 km depth in the KTB main well (Kontinentales Tiefbohrprogramm der Bundesrepublik Deutschland).Previously, a stress test in this well at 6 km depth yielded inconclusive results, because the pressure limit was reached when the formation appeared to approach breakdown (see the Discussion Section for a description of this test). In the experiment at 9 km depth, a heavy brine was selected to achieve the highest possible downhole pressure. In this experiment the downhole pressure would be limited by the casing burst strength to 185 MPa. The intention was first to do a microfrac stress test by injecting relatively small volumes of fluid at low flow rates and then to inject a large fluid volume to induce seismicity. The induced seismicity experiment was done to confirm and extend data on stress magnitude and orientation obtained through borehole measurements to 6.8 and 7.6 km depth, respectively (Ref. 6). This study indicated that stresses in the crust were sufficiently high that well oriented, preexisting faults were close to failure. Ref. 5 describes the induced seismicity experiment more fully. A solids free fluid was selected to have the highest fluid leak-off into natural fractures, which would promote seismicity.In this paper we investigate the pressure behavior to establish the mechanism of the injection process. We can use the seismic observations to support the pressure interpretation. For petroleum applications this experiment is important for stress tests in low permeability formations, with preexisting faults and fractures. With regard to stress test interpretation, we relate the pressure behavior to the stresses at the borehole surface and the stresses on the fault plane, where fluid injection occurred.Pressure analysisWellbore storage and leak-off: The increase in pressure with pumping can be described with a mass balance for the wellbore storage and some (unspecified) leak from the wellbore. The leak may be leak-off towards the formation, a fracture or leak into the casing annulus. The pressure derivative is written as: (1)P. 213

AB  - Abstract As the Oil and Gas industry looks forward to perforating next-generation complex wells (including but not limited to HPHT, deepwater, geothermal, multi-stage long horizontals etc.), computational modeling tools have been increasingly used to predict the transient flow physics that govern the design and optimization of perforating jobs. In particular, it is crucial to accurately predict the unsteady wellbore flow dynamics and relevant shock physics that typically occur during perforation jobs. Such modeling capabilities provide us the ability to prevent downhole equipment failures that may result from shock loading as well as lead to accurate predictions of perforation cleanup process which depends on balance of pressures in the reservoir, wellbore and gun. In addition, as complex completions such as those found in subsea wells and long horizontal wells are becoming more important, so is the need to extend such a predictive capability to higher-pressure and higher-temperature environment that often accompanies such wells. To address the above, this study is focused on the development and verification of a next-generation transient wellbore flow simulator that is used in conjunction with our existing perforation modeling software. The use of appropriate numerical algorithms allows the simulator to accurately capture unsteady compressible wellbore flows with large gradients of flow quantities. The set of governing equations for compressible flows are closed with improved thermodynamic equations of state, specifically designed to model extreme high pressure (up to 40,000 psi) and temperatures (up to 600 °F). Computational results from various shock-tube test cases show good agreement among exact solutions, single-phase numerical solutions, and the new three-phase solutions. Compared with our existing perforation modeling software, the next-generation simulator exhibits improved accuracy for HPHT environment, better shock-capturing properties, and improved computational efficiency. This unique computational tool has been integrated into an existing perforation job-design workflow to realize significant improvements in risk mitigation and design parameter optimization. This improved workflow enables a new decision process to better model and design challenging deepwater/HPHT perforating applications.

AB  - ABSTRACT: Accurate prediction of softening and failure behavior of rocks are essential to hydraulic fracturing simulation using strain-softening type models. Failure to preserve the fracture energy causes these continuums based numerical models to suffer from mesh-size dependency. The virtual Multi-dimensional Internal Bond Model (VMIB) is derived from a particle-based constitutive law at the micro scale. It has been implemented in a 3D Finite Element Method in which material softening and energy dissipation occur over the “representative elementary volume”. However, in realistic materials, energy dissipation is due to fracture surfaces creation instead of material softening in the element. In this work we present an improved VMIB model to bridge the energy dissipation over the representative elementary volume and the fracture surfaces using a virtual bond potential that incorporates the material fracture energy to eliminate the mesh-size sensitivity. The virtual bond potential considers both the critical fracture energy and element size. The 3D model is calibrated and verified by carrying out simulations of a group of three-point-bend tests using different mesh sizes. Then, by incorporating a three-dimensional element partition method, the model is applied to a series of laboratory scale hydraulic fracturing experiments. Furthermore, multiple hydraulic fracturing from closely-staged clusters is simulated. It is found that the model can accurately capture the fractures growth pattern that is influenced by the stress boundary conditions and the stress shadow interaction among the fractures. The results also show the predicted breakdown pressure reasonably agree with the experiment data.1. INTRODUCTIONIn hydraulic fracturing simulation, capturing rock mechanical behaviors in response of fluid pressurization is crucial for fracture pattern and fluid pressure prediction. Many analytical solutions [Sneddon, 1946; Sneddon and Elliot,1946; Khristianovic and Zheltov, 1955; Nordgren, 1972, Geertsma and de Klerk, 1969] based on linear elastic fracture mechanics (LEFM) have been proposed to analyze different mechanisms of fluid-driven fracturing. However, the complexity of hydraulic fractures brings challenge to classic model due to the constitution features of rock such as heterogeneity and nonlinearity. Therefore, to solve the complex fracturing problem, many numerical methods have been proposed. The Displacement Discontinuity Method (DDM) [Kumar, 2013; Weng et al., 2011; Sesetty and Ghassemi, 2012, 2013, 2017; Farmahini-Farahani and Ghassemi, 2015; Verde and Ghassemi, 2013] has been widely used in fracture mechanics, hydraulic fracturing and natural fracture networks interaction, especially in large scale problem and multiple complex fracture network simulation. Discrete Element Method (DEM) is an effective method of addressing engineering problems in granular materials. This particle-based method is an ideal tool to simulate rock failure and has been used to simulate the hydraulic fracture propagation [Damjanac et al., 2010; Deng, Podgorney and Huang, 2011]. Continuum based method associated with strain softening model has been widely used to capture the nonlinear mechanical behaviors of rocks. Coupled damage model have also been propsoed [Min et al., 2011; Min, 2013; Huang and Ghassemi, 2016] to simulate mixed-mode hydraulic fracture propagation. [Gao and Ghassemi, 2017] developed a 3D FEM model to analyze the pressurized fracture problem in heterogeneous rock. By introducing discontinuity into continuum Finite Element Method (FEM), the extended finite element method (XFEM) [Belytschko and Black, 1999; Moes et al., 1999] has also been implemented in hydraulic fracturing modeling [Gordeliy and Peirce, 2013, Dahi-Taleghani and Olson 2011, Wang 2015, Shi et al, 2017]. Phase field model [Moelans et al., 2008] is a versatile technique for solving interfacial problems at the mesoscale and has been employed to solve the fluid driven fracture propagation in porous media in small scale [Mikelic et al., 2015]. The Virtual Multidimensional Internal Bond (VMIB) is a particle based constitutive model that was proposed by [Zhang and Ge, 2005, 2006] to capture the macroscale material properties from the mechanical response of microscale particles and bonds. VMIB was used in [Huang et al., 2013] to simulate 3D mix-mode hydraulic fracture propagation. Recently, more hybrid methods have been proposed such as Finite- discrete element method [Zhao et al., 2014] and DDM-FEM [Kumar and Ghassemi, 2016] have been used for hydraulic fracturing simulation, which integrate the advance features of each method.

AB  - SummaryThis study is a comparison of hydraulic fracture models run using test data from the GRI Staged Field Experiment No. 3. Models compared include 2D, pseudo-3D, and 3D codes, run on up to eight different cases. Documented in this comparison are the differences in length, height, width, pressure, and efficiency. The purpose of this study is to provide the completions engineer with a practical comparison of the available models so that rational decisions can be made as to which model is optimal for a given application.IntroductionHydraulic fracturing, one of the most important stimulation techniques available to the petroleum engineer, is being used extensively in tight gas sandstones,1-5 coalbed methane,6 high-permeability sandstones in Alaska,7very weak sandstones off the U.S. gulf coast,8horizontal wells in chalks,9-10 and many other applications from waste disposal to geothermal reservoirs. Because of this diversity of application, hydraulic fracture design models must be able to account for widely varying rock properties, reservoir properties, in-situ stresses, fracturing fluids, and proppant loads. As a result, fracture simulation has emerged as a highly complex endeavor that must be able to account for many different physical processes.The petroleum engineer who must design the fracture treatment is often confronted with the difficult task of selecting a suitable hydraulic fracture model, yet there is very little comparative information available to help in making a rational choice, particularly on the newer 3D and pseudo-3D models. The purpose of this paper is to help provide some guidance by comparing many of the available simulators.The Fracture Propagation Modeling Forum held Feb. 26-27, 1991, near Houston provided the origin for this paper. This forum, sponsored by the Gas Research Inst. (GRI), was open to all known hydraulic fracturing modelers. Participants were asked to provide fracture designs based on the Staged Field Experiment (SFE) No. 3 fracture experiment. After the fracture designs presented at this meeting were compared, a final, revised data set was given to all participants. The results presented in this paper are derived from that data set. To publish the results, a four-member committee (the authors) was chosen from forum participants. In assembling this comparison, committee members purposely attempted to avoid judging the relative values of the different models. Only the results and quantifiable comparisons are given.Background—Basic Modeling DiscussionIn recent years, fracturing simulators used in the oil industry have proliferated. This proliferation was intensified by the availability of personal computers and the need for fast design simulators for use in the field. Applying these models as "black boxes," without knowledge of the underlying assumptions, may lead to erroneous conclusions, especially for unconfined fracture growth.Hydraulic fracturing is a complex nonlinear mathematical problem that involves the mechanical interaction of the propagating fracture with the injected slurry. Several assumptions are commonly made to render the problem tractable:plane fractures, symmetric with respect to the wellbore; elastic formation;linear fracture mechanics for fracture propagation prediction; power-law behavior of fracturing fluids and slurries; simplification of fracture geometry and its representation by few geometric parameters; etc. Ref. 11 gives a detailed description of the governing equations. Although the models predict "trends"of treating pressure behavior, they may not always reliably predict the observed behavior for a given treatment. This discrepancy has been attributed to many complex interactions between the injected fluids and the formation that are not well understood.An attempt to characterize phenomenologically some of these complex processes occurring within the fracture (e.g., multiple fractures and increasted frictional losses) and near the fracture tip (e.g., nonlinear formation behavior, microcracking, formation plasticity, dilatancy, and plugging) was made in various simulators by the introduction of additional ad hoc parameters ("knobs"). The choice of values for these parameters is based only on the modeler's experience. These knobs, used to match model predictions with field-observed behavior, result in the lack of a standard model response for a given physical problem. This issue was addressed in the forum by having different participants (discussing several different models) simulate common test cases derived from the actual SFE No.3 fracturing treatment. These models can be categorized in order of decreasing complexity as follows.Planar 3D models: TerraFrac of TerraTek Inc.12-16 run by Arco and HYFRAC3D by S.H.

Their difference is in the numerical technique used to calculate fracture opening. TerraFrac uses an integral equation representation, while the Ohio State model uses the finite-element method. Both models use finite elements for 2D fluid flow within the fracture and a fracture-tip advancement proportional to the stress-intensity factor on the fracture-tip contour.Planar 3D Models.The TerraFrac12-16 and the HYFRAC3D17 models incorporate similar assumptions and formulate the physics rigorously, assuming planar fractures of arbitrary shape in a linearly elastic formation, 2D flow in the fracture, power-law fluids, and linear fracture mechanics for fracture propagation.

AB  - Abstract This paper presents an overview of the development and implementation of a Topsides safety and control system to mitigate the risk of a downhole caprock breach in the BC-10 Phase 2 waterflood development. For the water injection development in deep water offshore Brazil (SS-BC-10 Phase II), there is a strict operational pressure envelope for the water injectors. Excessive pressurization of the sand can lead to fault reactivation and/or a breach of cap rock (shale) integrity. A breach in turn can lead to out of zone injection, propagation of the injected water to the seabed and release of hydrocarbons to the environment. The efflux of reservoir fluids to the seabed constitutes a major HSE hazard with potentially significant impact to environment and company reputation. Current subsea pressure measurements cannot be utilized in any Safety Instrumented Function (SIF), as these measurements are transmitted by equipment that is not rated for use in safety systems. Instead, we derived a relationship between the pressure of the water injection distribution header (WIDH), and the subsea pressure. From this relationship, we calculate a maximum pressure for the WIDH as the trip setting for a high pressure SIF. To implement this we have designed a Water Injection Pressure Protection System (WIPPS) that includes a safeguarding function as well as control funtion. The safeguarding function will provide a dynamic trip setting and will stop the water injection pump, and will close an isolation valve on the water distribution header. The control function consist of an override pressure controller for each water injection well, which will limit the flow of injection water if any injection well's pressure exceeds a specified setpoint. We concluded that the safeguarding and control system are compliant with our requirement for a Safety Integrity Level 3 (SIL3) safeguarding system. The safeguarding system requires regular testing and calibration to maintain this SIL. The WIPPS has been commissioned succesfully without any HSE incident and to date there has been no demand on the safeguarding function. We realize that it would be better to safeguard the injection wells by using direct measurements that are close to the injection point. However, this will require us to have a means to securely communicate subsea pressure measurements to the Safety Logic Solver (SLS). For this purpose we are developing new instruments that make use of a secure communications framework called Black Channel Communications.

AB  - Summary This paper describes a computerized technique to derive reliable andaccurate dips from high-resolution electrical images automatically, taking fulladvantage of their lateral continuity and azimuthal coverage. The quality ofthese dips can be checked by visual inspection. Results derived from threedifferent geologic contexts illustrate the technique. Introduction Electrical imaging tools with dense arrays of electrodes and high verticalsampling rates can produce images of a borehole wall. Such multipad toolsrecord several (two, four, or eight) images covering parts of the boreholecircumference. More precisely, electrical intensity measurements reflectingformation resistivity variations are converted into variable-intensity(gray-scale) images. By convention, black is low and white is high resistivity.Previous publications focused on the interpretation of such images. However,because of electrode overlap, large borehole coverage, and high verticalresolution, borehole imaging tools also can be used as powerful dipmeters. Thispaper describes a dip computation method that uses borehole images.* The papershows how the geometric information contained in the borehole images can betranslated into dense, accurate dip results with excellent visual qualitycontrol. Access to information about lateral continuity of geologic features isinstrumental for computing dips in cases where bedding features arenoncontinuous around the borehole [e.g., having an optical-tens shape orinterrupted by other features, such as fractures (Fig. 1) and where the beddingfeatures show a high apparent dip (Figs. 2 and 3)]. On an oriented, unwrappedplot of a cylindrical borehole, the trace of a planar-bedding boundary appearsas a sine wave. The idea is to capture the segments of such a sine wave presentin the images and to restore the connections between these segments. Theapproach borrows from recent image-analysis techniques and frompattern-matching algorithms. 5 The algorithm consists of two mainpattern-matching algorithms. 5 The algorithm consists of two main steps: (1) apattern-recognition technique extracts the bedding boundary traces on eachimage and (2) a matching procedure connects those traces among the differentimages, The pattern-detection algorithm is based on a gradient method todelineate the local anisotropy direction of the image, which covers the imagewith a dense network of "flowlines." This directional information isused to compute a stacked conductivity curve. Significant inflection points inthe curve are selected to sort the flowlines and to retain only thosecorresponding to bedding boundaries. The matching procedure combines severalalgorithms to recover the complete path of the boundaries across the differentimages. A self-adaptive search technique reduces the number of candidates. Thefinal match is obtained by finding the path of minimum cost in a graph. Then alocal dip is computed that takes into account the borehole shape measured bytwo calipers, the inclinometry, and the spread of current lines into theformation, as for any dipmeter. The steps are described in detail later. Event Detection In a Single Image The method presented here is inspired by an image-analysis technique thatKass and Witkin developed. It is based on the analysis of local anisotropydirections of an intensity pattern. In our implementation, a gray-scale imageis divided into a field of anisotropy directions called the flow field andmaterialized by a flowline network running in the bedding direction and a 1Dcurve called the median stack, computed by taking the median of the image datain the flow-field direction. This separates information about the shape of thebedding from information about its intensity (Fig. 4). An edge-detectionalgorithm then is performed on the median conductivity stack. performed on themedian conductivity stack. Tracking the Bedding Direction. The flow field is adescription of the local anisotropy of an oriented pattern. Intuitively, theprocedure extracts from the image events with a well-defined procedure extractsfrom the image events with a well-defined orientation characteristic of beddingcontour lines. Other nonoriented texture is removed by appropriate filters. Thesix operations involved in the construction of the flowline network aredescribed next. Filtering the Image. This removes high-frequency, uncorrelatednoise from the images (Fig. 5). We use a 2D Gaussian filter, which has beenchosen for the following properties. Isotropy. The form of the fitter's impulseresponse is unaffected by rotation of the axes so that filtering does notintroduce a preferential direction of its own. This isotropy feature isimportant in our search for preferential pattern orientations because ananisotropic Filter would introduce artificial directions. Separability. Theimpulse response can be written as the product of functions of the two imagecoordinates, x and y, product of functions of the two image coordinates, x andy, separately. This property allows for performance and simplicity in computerimplementation of the filter. Furthermore, the Burt pyramid algorithmapproximates the Gaussian convolution. pyramid algorithm approximates theGaussian convolution. Computing a Gradient-Vector Field. Image intensity can beconsidered a function of the two image coordinates x and y. The gradient of atwo-variable function at (x,y) is a vector whose components are the partialderivatives of the function at this point. This vector is oriented in thedirection where the image varies the most. The direction orthogonal to thegradient, the strike or flow direction (Fig. 6), corresponds to the orientationof minimum change. In a discrete function, the gradient is approximated withconvolution masks. We use the two Sobel masks, which are defined on a 3 x 3window. The output of these two masks approximates the partial derivatives withrespect to x and y. The gradient partial derivatives with respect to x and y.The gradient modulus and polar angle are computed (Fig. 5) from both partialderivatives. The angle used to track the flowline direction is sensitive tonoise, hence the need for filtering. Filtering the Gradient Field. Directfiltering of the gradient-vector field might risk canceling two opposite (ornearly opposite) orientations. Consider, for example, an image presenting anorth-south crest. The gradient vectors on the west half-plane all point east,and the gradient vectors on the east half-plane all point west. Adding themresults in cancellation. point west. Adding them results in cancellation. Toavoid this phenomenon, which also may create aberrant directions, the anglebetween the x axis and the gradient vector is doubled before filtering, whichpositions the possible orientations in a half-circle. If the gradient vector isconsidered as a complex number, squaring the gradient complex number doublesthe angle and squares the modulus. If we consider the opposite gradient, thetwo gradient vectors cancel when added; they reinforce after squaring. Thefirst effect of squaring is to return two previously opposite vectors in thesame direction so that they positively combine instead of canceling each other.Rotating the gradient vectors often makes the difference in being able todetect the flow direction. The second effect of the squaring is to reinforcethe high-modulus vectors. SPEFE P. 96

AB  - ABSTRACT:It is evident that the reserves available for mining in the goldfields of South Africa are likely to be significantly reduced in 10 to 15 years. A significant percentage of the ore reserves, within gold mines of South Africa, are probably locked up in pillars. Although some of these pillars were especially designed to reduce the closures and energy release rates, other pillars were formed because of increasingly difficult mining conditions, better reserves elsewhere, or an un-pay block at the time of mining. With shrinking reserves at reasonable depth, some of these remnants have to be mined to ensure sustainability and in certain cases preservation. However, such mining is expected to be carried out at higher average stress levels when compared to stress levels for conventional mining panels. As a result the hazards and risk to safety is expected to be higher. The need to develop methodologies to identify the hazards associated with remnant extraction to ensure higher levels of safety and improved efficiency in production, is therefore of paramount importance to all stakeholders. Until now, although there is a considerable amount of remnant extraction, very little research has been done to evaluate the risks involved. This paper reports on some of the findings of a three year research project undertaken to understand and quantify the hazards associated with remnant mining.INTRODUCTIONAlthough many remnants have been extracted and many are in the process of being extracted, the rockmass behaviour within these remnants is not well understood or documented. Much of the information and most of the designs in use today are based on experience passed on between practitioners.From an industry survey, Rangasamy and Jager [1] concluded that in the Far West Rand region, a definition for remnants based on size and seismic history is favoured. The shape, block stress and geology are considered secondary definition criteria. In the Klerksdorp and Free State regions, stress, geology and seismic history of the area feature prominently in the definition of remnants.

AB  - ABSTRACT:The evaluation of the stability of pillar layout problems requires an assessment of the interactive response of the pillar deformations to assess whether the layout is both regionally and locally stable. Classically, this analysis requires an evaluation of the global stiffness of the layout in relation to the assumed or measured strength properties of the individual pillars. In practical problems it is important to be able to assess detailed local deformations when the individual pillars have irregular shapes. The paper describes a boundary element-based computational tool that is formulated to allow for the evaluation of irregular pillar geometries using higher order triangular or quadrilateral-shaped displacement discontinuity elements. Shallow depth (half-space) influence functions are incorporated in the formulation and the solution efficiency is improved by using a hierarchical computational scheme that can be adapted to problems comprising general polygonal shaped elements. In addition, it is shown that the introduction of the higher order (cubic or quartic) element structure can facilitate the evaluation of deformation mechanisms near individual pillars in hard rock conditions. In particular, it is possible to investigate local damage and failure behaviour associated with particular geological structures such as weak parting bands or weak layers within the pillars. These features are demonstrated by applying the model to an illustrative case study of a pillar design exercise for a section of a shallowdepth platinum mine.INTRODUCTIONA popular numerical procedure that can be applied to the computation of stress and displacement distributions in the vicinity of tabular mine layouts is the so-called displacement discontinuity method (DDM). This method found initial application in the analysis of coal mining problems [Hackett, 1959 and Berry and Sales, 1962] and was introduced in South Africa by Salamon, 1964, as the face element principle for the determination of stresses induced in the vicinity of deep level gold mine stopes and shallow depth coal mining operations. Excavations are approximated as slit discontinuity surfaces with the opposite faces allowed to interpenetrate one another to accommodate the elastic response of a tabular opening in a superimposed stress field. Early implementations of this method in computer packages made the assumption that element shapes are square with constant values of the unknown displacement discontinuity vector assigned to each element [Crouch and Starfield, 1983, Ryder and Napier, 1985, Napier and Stephansen, 1987]. Mine layout problems are then analyzed by assigning a state of mined or solid to each element to represent the overall extraction pattern. A specific sub-class of problems relates to the design of pillar workings at shallow depths in both coal and platinum mining operations. In these cases, the economic extraction of shallow depth reserves requires a careful assessment of the trade off between underground mining and opencast mining with accompanying surface rehabilitation costs. The economic performance of an underground pillar mining operation can be crucially affected by an optimal choice of the layout pattern and effective extraction ratio. It is equally important to assess the detailed behaviour of the panel pillars and their possible failure. This can be facilitated by suitable monitoring and instrumentation programs that allow ongoing assessment of the local ground conditions adjacent to specific pillars. At the same time, it is essential to be able to interpret these field measurements quantitatively to reveal significant trends such as accelerated deformations or build up of an undesirable stress concentration.

AB  - SummaryWe used optimal control theory as an optimization algorithm for the valve settings in smart wells. We focused on their use in injectors and producers for the waterflooding of heterogeneous reservoirs. As a followup to an earlier intuitive optimization approach, a systematic dynamic optimization approach based on optimal control theory was developed. The objective was to maximize recovery or net present value of the waterflooding process over a given time period. We investigated the scope for optimization under purely pressure- and purely rate-constrained operating conditions, and concluded that: (1) for wells operating on bottomhole-pressure constraints, the benefit of using smart wells is mainly reduced water production rather than increased oil production, and (2) for wells operating on rate constraints, there is generally a large scope for accelerating production and increasing recovery, in combination with a drastic reduction in water production.IntroductionThe development of wells containing permanent downhole measurement and control equipment (in the remainder of this paper referred to as smart wells) potentially enables significant improvement of the oil production process. In an earlier study, we investigated the static optimization of waterflooding with smart wells, using heuristic algorithms.1 Static implies that the injection and production rates of the inflow control valves (ICVs) in the wells were kept constant during the displacement process, until water breakthrough at the producers occurred. Significant improvements were realized for simple reservoir models. Results suggested that more improvement could be expected by dynamically optimizing injection and production rates. Later, we therefore addressed the same problem using an optimization technique known as optimal control theory.2 In addition to being more systematic, enabling optimization also for more complex heterogeneities, this technique allowed for dynamic waterflooding control. Optimal control theory has been used before in reservoir engineering. Fathi and Ramirez used it to optimize surfactant flooding processes,3,4 Mehos to optimize CO2 flooding, 5 Liu and Ramirez to optimize steamflooding,6 and Zakirov et al. to optimize production from a thin oil rim.7 Furthermore, the same technique has been used in history matching reservoir models with production data. Optimization of waterflooding using optimal control theory has been studied before by Asheim,8 Virnovski,9 Sudaryanto and Yortsos,10-12 and Dolle et al.2 The optimization objective was either to maximize water breakthrough time at given field rates, or to maximize cumulative oil production or net present value (NPV) within a given time. In all these waterflood-optimization cases, the flow in the reservoir was controlled with wells that operated at constant field injection and production rates (i.e., the total injection and production rates were kept constant but the distribution over the wells was changed over time). In real life, however, a production strategy with constant field rates will often not be feasible, because it may require unrealistic bottomhole pressures, and associated sandface pressures. These could be too low pressures at the producers, resulting in lift die-out, or too high at the injectors, exceeding maximum allowable formation or equipment pressures. In the present study, we therefore investigated the scope for dynamic optimization for two extreme well-operating conditions. The first is completely rate-constrained injection and production, in which field injection and production rates are always at the maximum. The second is completely pressure-constrained injection and production, in which the injectors always inject at the maximum allowable injection pressure and the producers always produce at the minimum allowable well-flowing pressure.Problem FormulationDynamic System Model. We considered a heterogeneous, horizontal, 2D, two-phase (oil/water) reservoir with two horizontal smart wells, an injector and a producer, at opposite sides (see Fig. 1). The reservoir has no-flow boundaries at all sides. Each well is divided into segments with ICVs, allowing for individual inflow control of the segments. Alternatively, the two horizontal wells can be interpreted as rows of vertical injectors and producers. We used a conventional finite-difference approximation to describe the reservoir, with details as given in Appendix A. The resulting numerical model can be represented as a discrete-time dynamic system model:Equation 1where g is a nonlinear vector function, x is the vector of state variables with elements corresponding to the oil pressures and water saturations in each gridblock, k=0, . . . , K is the timestep, and u is the vector of the input variables or control variables, with elements that correspond to the water injection or liquid production rates in those gridblocks that are penetrated by a well.

AB  - Abstract The Erskine field will be the first high pressure / high temperature (HPHT) field- developed in the North Sea. Erskine presents a number of technical challenges requiring safe, cost effective, and innovative design solutions Specifically, a safe Normally Unattended installation (NUI) is required, severe wax and corrosion problems have to be dealt with, a process module has to be installed in a minimal space, and foremost, HPHT safety concerns have to be addressed. The Erskine design achieves (1) a planned NW visit frequency of four to six weeks, (2) transportation and processing of very waxy fluids through cold (40° F) North Sea waters, (3) transportation of hot (300° F) corrosive fluids in a carbon steel pipeline, (4) over-pressure protection without the use of relief valves, and (5) a compact, minimum area processing module added 10 an existing host platform..IntroductionThe Erskine Field is a gas condensate field located in 296 feet of water within the United Kingdom Continental Shelf (UKCS) 150 miles east of Aberdeen. Recoverable resumes are estimated at 335 BCF of gas and 75 MMBBL of liquids. The field design production rates are 117 MMSCFD and 30,650 BOPD. The field was sanctioned and approved in April 1995 and plateau gas sales will commence 1 October 1997. The field development configuration is shown in Fig. 1 and consists of a NUl tied back to a Host Platform (Lomond Platform) 19 miles distant via a 16' nominal bore multiphase pipeline. A dedicated processing module will be installed on Lomond. The module will receive the multiphase fluids and separate, process, meter, and export the dried gas and condensate into the existing CATS gas system and the Forties Pipeline System respectively. The design of the Erskine facilities had to overcome a number of technical challenges.The Erskine HPHT reservoirs have initial bottom hole conditions of 14,000 psia and 350°F, wellhead shut-in pressure (WHSIP) of 10,600 psia, and flowing surface temperatures of 300° F.Production fluids contain up to 33 ppmv H2S. 5.5 mole % CO2ard 90,000 ppm Cl'. Field reserves are considered marginal for North Sea development.Condensate contains approximately 10 wt. % wax forming compounds. Host platform is located 19 miles distant. The host platform space for module footprint is limited 10 a 30 ft by 61 ft area.Technical solutions to these field challenges have taken the following forms:Minimum Attendance Installation. In an effort to reduce personnel risks to as low as practical, all aspects of the Erskine platform have been designed to minimise manned intervention. Many NUI'S require one or more weekly interventions. The Erskine platform has a maximum planned visit frequency of once every four to six weeks.

AB  - SYNOPSIS:A plain strain boundary element formulation is described for modelling inelastic behaviour of a brittle rock continuum in which mining excavations are embedded. Efficient iteration, kernel pre-calculation and lumping procedures were devised to enhance computational efficiency. A novel, interpretation of interacting element self-effects in terms of load lines further facilitates the modelling of the non-linear zones of the rock mass. The hard brittle quartzites of South African gold mines exhibit extreme load-shedding, strengthening with confinement according to a Mohr-Coulomb law, and strong post-failure volume dilatancy. The behaviour of such rock in the fracture zone around square tunnels is modelled as a case study in the paper. RESUME:On decrit un plan de deformation d'allongement des elements limite pour modeliser le comportement inelastique d'une roche dure et fragile renfermant des travaux miniers. Des iterations efficaces du coefficient d'influences pre-calculees et le procede de groupement ont ete etablis pour ameliorer l'efficacite des traitements de donnees. Une interpretation originale des elements interactifs "effet independant" au niveau des charges a l'avantage de faciliter la modeli sation des zones non-lineaires des masses de roche. Les quartzites durs et fragiles des mines d'or Sud-Africaines montrent que le deslestage extrême augmente la compression d'après la loi de Mohr-Coulomb et l'elargissement rapide des volumes apparaît "post rupture". On modelise le comportement d'une telle roche dans la zone de fracture autour de tunnels de section carree pour en donner un exemple. ZUSAMMENFASSUNG:Das inelastische Verhalten eines bergmannischen Abbaues in sprödem Gebirge wird mit Hilfe von "boundary elements" des ebenen Dehnungszustandes modelliert. Wirtschaftliche Iteration, Vorherberechnung yon Einflußkoeffizienten und Zusammenfassung der Einflußbereiche wurden zur Verbesserung der Berechnungswirtschaftlichkeit entwickelt. Ein neue Interpretation der Wechselwirkung von Einflußelementen in Bezug auf Lastlinien, vereinfachen weiterhin das Modellieren von nichtlinearen Zonen in dem Gebirge. Die harten und spröden Quartzite der suedafrikanischen Goldminen weisen extremen Lastabfall nach dem Bruch, sowie eine Verfestigung mit steigenden Umschlingungsdrucken, entsprechend des Mohr-Coulomb Gesetzes und stark nachbruechige Volumensvergrößerungen nach dem Bruch auf. Das Verhalten eines derartigen Gebirges in der Bruchzone eines quadratischen Tunnel profiles wird als typischer Fall beschrieben. 1. INTRODUCTIONSince the late 1960's, the gold mining industry in South Africa has made increasing use of numerical rock stress analysis programs as an integral part of the mine design process. “MINSIM” (Plewman, Deist and Ortlepp, 1969) and its successors currently account for nearly 1500 problem runs per year in South Africa, where rock mechanics engineers-are interested in designing deep level tabular mining layouts and sequences aimed at minimizing service excavation stresses and face energy release rates. “MINAP” (Crouch, 1976) and its extensions is another popular Boundary Element program; restricted to 2 dimensions but otherwise more general in that excavations need not all be tabular, and inhomogeneities, fault-sliding and other quasi-nonlinearities can easily be studied. These programs base their applicability on the observation that remote from excavations, South African rock strata commonly appear to behave in a strictly linear-elastic fashion (for example, Ryder and Officer, 1964). It is clear however that for designing support to control instabilities of pillar, haulage or ore-pass sidewalls or stope hangingwalls, to understand the vagaries of face pre-fracturing - a necessity for economic non-explosive stoping in hard rock (Joughin, 1976) - or to obtain any measure of quantitative understanding of the rockburst problem, some form of modelling of the inelastic behaviour of the skin of fractured material surrounding deep-level excavations must be undertaken (Figure 1). Two pioneering workers in the field (Deist, 1966; Crouch, 1970) recognized this need by taking it as the theme in their respective doctoral theses. The extension-type fractures ahead of such stope faces are subtly banded and occur together with less common inclined fractures along which displacements of up to l40mm have been observed (Adams, et al., 1981). Laboratory studies of the full triaxial behaviour of brittle rock required the development of stiff testing machines (Cook and Hojem, 1966) (Figure 2), but the dependence of particularly the detailed post-failure characteristics on such aspects as specimen size and geometry, end effects, strain-rate,-loading path, intermediate principal stress, lateral and axial stiffness, of the testing apparatus and the like, remain still very much open questions. However, the qualitative aspects of Figure 2 can be taken as established: the rapid increase in peak strength with lateral confinement according to an approximately linear Mohr-Coulomb law, the pronounced negative-slope or, load-shedding post-failure characteristic with equally pronounced lateral dilatation, tending finally into a regime of heavy damage where behaviour may perhaps be described in terms of simple plasticity or soil mechanics theory. In this paper a novel boundary element methodology for modelling the kind of behaviour shown in Figure 2 is introduced. Some key points in the particular modelling philosophy are reviewed. In addition simplifications chosen to reduce the complexities of the real world suggested by Figure lb and 2 to more reasonable bounds are discussed.

AB  - Abstract: This paper describes how Particle Image Velocimetry (PIV) techniques applied to X-Ray Computed Tomography (XRCT) data may be used to differentiate intensity changes due to chemical alteration from those of mechanical deformation. The XRCT-PIV method provides a non-invasive means of tracking solid deformation that is robust despite chemical alteration and noise. The results of the XRCT-PIV analysis can be used to map reacted regions back to the sample's undeformed configuration and thereby obtain a more accurate identification of reacted regions. The approach is demonstrated on tomographic datasets from a core-flood experiment examining reactive transport of carbonated brine through a naturally fractured sample from the Ohaaki geothermal field in New Zealand.

AB  - Abstract Understanding reservoir architecture is critically important to effective reservoir management. Misinterpreting reservoir compartmentalization, for instance, can result in non-optimal well placement, completion strategy, and facilities design as well as large errors in reserves, drainage volume and production rate predictions. Downhole fluid analysis along with complementary techniques including geochemical, mud-gas and pressure analyses provide valuable insights into reservoir architecture. Each analytic method relies on different fluid traits and has its own limitations. With systematic integration of different methods, the synergy delivers a more accurate characterization of the reservoir. In this paper, we link traditional and novel fluid analysis methods to build a more complete interpretation of the reservoir fluids and provide greater insight into reservoir architecture. This leads to improved understanding of structural history, hydrocarbon migration and entrapment, reservoir connectivity, and fluid contact levels. This, in turn, enables better well placement and more effective development planning. We highlight three case studies in which we have successfully combined various fluid-based techniques for improved reservoir characterization. Introduction Determining connectivity at the reservoir scale remains the elusive goal for predicting long-term production profiles. Characterization of reservoir architecture and the fluids therein is the biggest challenge in achieving this goal. In addition to 3D seismic imaging, drill stem testing and extended well tests were traditionally the only available methods for detecting compartmentalization and flow boundaries. However, in deepwater or similar settings, full-scale testing is inordinately expensive and environmentally taxing. Moreover, interpretation of well test responses in turbidite and onlapping channel reservoirs can be highly non-unique due to the complex architecture of such reservoirs. Today, novel techniques such as Downhole Fluid Analysis (DFA), mud-gas analysis and geochemical fingerprinting can be integrated with geologic data to better assess reservoir continuity and/or compartmentalization before field development commences. From these fluid property data and geologic models, dynamic reservoir models can be built to accurately simulate production and help select optimal reservoir management policies. This paper includes examples in which we integrate pressure gradient, PVT, mud-gas, geochemical and downhole fluid analyses with available geological and geophysical data for the identification of flow barriers, evaluation of connectivity across faults and prediction of fluid contacts. Downhole Fluid Analysis In recent years, formation sampling and testing tools have seen the introduction of an array of downhole fluid property measurements. These include optical absorption spectroscopy, optical reflectance, fluorescence and a few other non-optical measurements. The spectroscopic DFA technique utilizes optical absorption properties of reservoir fluid in the visible to near-infrared (NIR) range. Optical spectra are obtained in real time and at in situ conditions, and fluid composition is derived from the signature using the proportion of methane (C1), ethane to propane (C2-5), the hexane plus fraction (C6+), and carbon dioxide (CO2). The gas-oil-ratio (GOR) of the fluid is then estimated from the derived composition (Mullins et al, 2005a, Dong et al, 2006, Fujisawa et al, 2006). Additionally, the differences in absorption spectra between reservoir fluid and oil-base mud (OBM) or water-base mud (WBM) are used to estimate fluid sample contamination with the drilling fluid. The downhole fluorescence measurement is used to identify fluid phases. This is especially useful for near critical fluids. Fluorescence is also sensitive to liquid dropout in a condensate gas when the flowing pressure falls below the dew point and can therefore be used to monitor fluid phase separation in real time to ensure representative single-phase gas samples are collected.

AB  - Abstract Over the last three years the BP AGT Region in the Caspian has deployed a new Field of the Future technology to automate the monitoring of safety critical valves' actuation time. This paper discusses the deployment of this tool, particularly focusing on the business value delivered and the lessons learnt. The Azerbaijan-Georgia-Turkey (AGT) Region is a BP organisational unit, operating a number of major upstream and midstream assets in Azerbaijan, Georgia, and Turkey, including six large integrated offshore platforms in the Caspian Sea, and three export pipelines. Automating the monitoring of valves is not always included in the business case for intelligent oilfields, and the operations focus may be seen as less value-adding than some of the reservoir or well based applications, but the business value is clear. The operational prize is relatively easy to measure and capture when retrofitting to a brownfield site that has reached a steady state of performance. BP in Azerbaijan chose to initially deploy this technology about two years after startup, once the maintenance team's focus shifted away from post commissioning problems, and comparison to steady state operation was possible, and the application had reached maturity. Detailed valve time tracking adds value by reducing the need to plan safety valve testing, if a plant shutdown occurs - planned or unplanned during the window within which procedures dictate a valve test must be conducted. In addition, the application provides performance tracking over time that might not be available from routine planned testing. The avoidance of yearly function checks has resulted in significant savings in manpower costs and plant outages and early warning of valve performance degradation can be acted upon before they result in failures. Running this application in the Caspian has demonstrated business value to BP locally through improved reliability and reduced maintenance costs, and has resulted in the take up of this new technology across BP worldwide. Field of the Future is a registered trademark of BP. Introduction Reliable operation of safety critical valves is vital to the oil and gas industry. Safety valves represent an important layer of protection for the plant and their failure to operate on demand can cause catastrophic consequences (e.g. leakage or over pressurization). Their function tests are designed to guarantee that the valves meet their reliability targets, associated with their calculated probability of failure on demand, consistently over their life-cycle. These are crucial to successfully deliver Integrity Management requirements and give assurance about the reliability of these safety critical devices. Function testing a safety valve, like an emergency shutdown valve (ESDV) or a blow down valve (BDV), is a significant job for the Maintenance department in Operations. A key element of the function test is the travel time. This is the time that an ESDV takes to close or the time that a BDV takes to open - these times have to be within targets to guarantee the correct operation of the valves. Measuring safety valve travel time requires operating these critical devices, which normally results in a partial plant shutdown with inevitable consequences on the production profile.

AB  - Abstract Modern Oil and Gas facilities are designed to meet an extensive array of government legislation and international standards and are subjected to a range of technical and operational safety reviews and analysis to identify and reduce failure risk. By taking such an approach, residual risks can be demonstrated to be As Low As Reasonably Practicable, (ALARP) - this process is normally recorded through a Safety Case or safety report, reflecting good oil and gas practice. Despite the use of recognised Exploration and Production, (E&P) practices provided in ISO, API, IEC, national standards and local in country regulations, major accidents are still occurring in the industry with an unacceptable frequency of intolerable business consequences. In addition, the differing regulatory compliance regimes between countries may not provide an equitable approach to operational and design requirements affecting safety and in particular the suitability of the risk management processes adopted. It is generally accepted by E&P companies that significant major accident risk reduction is achieved at the design stage, to ensure that facilities are robust against system or component failure of Safety Critical Elements, (SCE). Moreover, regulatory bodies are increasingly expected by the public to adopt a robust intervention approach should operators continue to operate using an increasing set of operational deviations or with assets not in compliance with risk based inspection and testing requirements. In addition to the risk reduction achieved through the design, it is also understood that the human-machine interaction to respond to hazardous situations has a significant role to play in preventing the hazard occurrence and/or mitigating the magnitude of the consequence. This paper will provide an overview of how the E&P industry provides robust "fail-safe?? designs against Major Accident Hazards, (MAH) and possible differences in design practices between different E&P sectors, such as production platforms versus drilling rigs. The paper will also examine other major hazards' industries and assess how their design requirements are configured to ensure that risk control systems fail in a safe manner and extrapolate these approaches to the E&P business. Case studies will be used to show how "fail-safe?? design principles can be applied to the system design of a sub-sea well connected to a Mobile Offshore Drilling Unit, MODU during exploration drilling and also at the component level for the Blow-Out Preventer (BOP). The paper will discuss the findings from the case studies in the context of a providing a fail-safe design approach to reduce residual risks.

AB  - Abstract In the search for energy, new technologies bring added benefits. These new technologies are driven by the need to be more environmentally conscious, reduce costs, increase reliability, reach farther and deeper, and provide more and better data to more effectively manage wells and equipment. With these new technologies, the industry is making a steady transition toward electrification and digitalization of the well completion. Electrification of completion equipment has occurred at a steady pace for several years, but the pace has quickened as the reliability of equipment has improved and the benefits of additional data have been realized. Within the last few years, the first completions with all-electric Christmas trees (XT) were run. Because all-electric tubing retrievable downhole safety valves were not yet available, these were not true all-electric completions. These first wells required the XTs to be installed with hydraulically operated downhole safety valves, making these mixed-technology completions. Recently, an all-electric tubing retrievable downhole safety valve was developed, qualified, and field tested. The introduction of the all-electric tubing retrievable downhole safety valve will bring the benefits of an all-electric completion to the oil industry. All-electric tubing retrievable downhole safety valves, also known as electric surface-controlled subsurface safety valves (ESCSSV), build upon field proven technology, but offer the added benefits that an electrically operated tool can provide while performing the same critical function as the traditional hydraulic downhole safety valve. This paper describes the development and deployment of the ESCSSV; it includes discussions about the qualification program of the valve and valve systems, integration with the all-electric subsea XT and control system, and installation in the well.

AB  - AbstractThe usual approach to the interpretation of producing wells is based on mechanistic models for the simulation of steady state and transient flow regimes. However, there are significant reservations about convergence problems, computational limits, the need for extensive tuning on field data, the instability of boundary conditions, the limited applicability of existing multiphase flow models, and the uncertainties associated with choke valve models. The current industry standards are critically reviewed within this framework.The real-time monitoring of producing wells is recognised as the best way of optimising field performance. Monitoring a producing well implies the ability to track, in real-time, any changes in fluid composition, flow rates, or pressure and temperature profiles. Multiphase Flow Metering (MFM) plays a key role in this scenario. Such information, combined with the critical analysis of historical data from the well itself or from analogue wells, allows diagnosis of the system and prediction of future trends. However, field data per se' do not necessarily generate knowledge. This is particularly true for large databases, which are difficult to manipulate to provide suitable inputs for wellbore simulators. This paper suggests how MFM, Knowledge Discovery in Databases (KDD) and Fuzzy Logic (FL) can offer an alternative approach to the analysis of producing wells. KDD is the automated extraction of patterns representing knowledge implicitly stored in large information repositories. Distributed, ad-hoc field measurements (including MFM and downhole measurements) can be processed via data cleaning, data integration, data mining, artificial intelligence, and pattern evaluation. FL can then manage the resulting information in terms of flow assurance and production optimisation.The same techniques can also be extended to the reservoir and the production network, for an integrated approach to production system analysis. IntroductionProduction wells are the physical connection between the reservoir and the surface facilities. As such, they are part of a production system, which is a network of components through which underground hydrocarbons must flow in order to reach the surface. It includes and is characterised by the following: the reservoir, with its geological and petrophysical properties, and also the properties of the fluids stored within it; the production wells, in particular, their completions and any artificial lift solutions; the flow control valves, such as the wellhead chokes; the flowlines, and any flow assurance solutions associated with them (such as single or multiphase pumping, thermal isolation and chemical injection); the separation and treatment facilities, both subsea and at surface.Beside this hardware, the properties of multiphase flows within the reservoir and through the production network must also be taken into account for the production system to be fully characterised. It is common knowledge that variations of any of the above characteristics are reflected in the rest of the system, and therefore that none of the elements of the system can be considered physically disconnected from the others. This means that the production system can be regarded as an integrated production system.

AB  - Abstract This paper describes a process for actively managing well integrity throughout the development life cycle with a particular focus on the production operations / well maintenance phase. Although developed in relation to ConocoPhillips UK North Sea development wells, most of the features of the process have application to all development well operations (both onshore & offshore) under any regulatory regime. The original well integrity management process was developed in order to demonstrate compliance with the UK Offshore Installations & Wells (Design & Construction, etc) Regulations 1996 (DCR). Since that time the original process has continued to be modified to improve effectiveness & efficiency. As well as describing the current process, this paper also describes its development and how we see that the process might evolve in the future. DCR regulations form a part of the UK ‘safety case' regime. The ‘safety case' regime places a strong focus on the development of site-specific performance standards; it also utilises the principles of independent examination & verification in order to demonstrate compliance. The process described in this paper represents a significant new contribution to the management of major accident hazards in well operations since it focuses on the use of performance standards and independent examination in order to ensure well integrity. Introduction All prudent well operators recognise the need to actively manage well integrity throughout the development life cycle. Different operators take different approaches depending on the nature of their operations, the risk profiles presented and the regulatory regime. It is arguable that the industry has historically focussed a great deal of its attention on management of well integrity during the well design and construction phase. For exploration and appraisal wells drilled in increasingly challenging environments (underbalanced, HPHT, etc) this is entirely appropriate. However, it may be that in doing so the industry has not kept pace in terms of managing its approach to development well integrity during the operations and maintenance cycle. For many development wells, continued application of tried and tested industry standards is probably still the best strategy. However, in other situations, a fresh approach may be justifiable:     •     For subsea development wells, often remote from host facilities, well integrity management standards might be improved by reflecting site-specific safety & environmental risks rather than applying integrity management standards more appropriate to platform-based wells.     •     Even for conventional platform / onshore wells, appropriate integrity management standards might be allowed to vary depending upon well conditions (e.g. not-naturally-flowing, etc).     •     Recent developments in completion equipment (particularly subsurface safety systems) may also justify changes to historically accepted well integrity management standards.     •     Historically, well intervention operations have often received less formal control than drilling operations. There is perhaps a need to recognise that some of these operations pose potentially increased safety risks and should be subject to a greater level of control through the application of appropriate operations standards.

AB  - Abstract A scale-up correlation derived from laboratory experimentation and calibrated with field tubing data provides improved real-time estimates of bottomhole treating pressure (BHTP) during displacement of delayed-crosslink HPG fluids with or without proppant. Current real-time hydraulic fracturing pressure analysis requires knowledge of BHTP throughout treatments. Measurement of this pressure indirectly at the surface through a live pressure indirectly at the surface through a live annulus or directly by a downhole gauge is not always feasible, practical, or economically justifiable. In these situations, this pressure is estimated by adjusting measured surface treating pressure to downhole conditions. pressure to downhole conditions. Hydrostatic head is added and friction pressure losses subtracted from surface treating pressure to adjust to downhole conditions. Friction pressure loss estimates typically depend on laboratory, yard test, or field annular flow based, semi-empirical correlations. Correlations developed from data collected by these methods are shown not to be applicable to friction loss predictions for flow of these particular fluids down long vertical tubing strings. Verification of this point is presented in the form of comparison of directly measured values to values predicted by correlations based on these methods presented in this paper and in the literature. A laboratory correlation developed in this paper was found to possess some unique paper was found to possess some unique characteristics which lend themselves readily to field calibration with actual tubing friction loss data. Field calibration, combined with a capacity to consider various tubing diameters, flow rates, and gel/proppant concentrations creates a powerful tool for estimating tubing friction pressure loss and hence BHTP when injecting these fluids on a real-time basis. Introduction Using an on-site computer system to perform real-time fracturing pressure analysis of the type proposed by Nolte and Smith requires reliable proposed by Nolte and Smith requires reliable estimates, measurements of bottomhole treating pressure. Analysis of treating pressure using pressure. Analysis of treating pressure using this technique requires that a logarithmic plot of net pressure versus time be prepared. Net fracturing pressure is defined as follows: ...................(1) where: p = net fracturing pressure, psi [kpal BHTP = bottomhole treating pressure, psi [kpal pc = fracture closure pressure, psi [kPa] Unfortunately, indirect measurement of BHTP at the surface through a static annulus/tubing fluid column, or a direct measurement by a downhole gauge is not always feasible, practical, and/or economically justifiable. In the majority of cases, it is necessary to estimate BHTP by adjusting measured surface pressure to bottomhole conditions with the following equation: ...............(2) Hydrostatic head, p h, is added and both fracture entry, P pf, and treating string, p f, friction pressure loss values are subtracted from measured pressure loss values are subtracted from measured wellhead (surface) injection pressure, p w, to make an adjustment to bottomhole conditions. Hydrostatic head determination is straightforward and requires only knowledge of formation depth and tubular fluid density. Fracture entry pressure loss can be determined from an instantaneous shutin pressure obtained while pumping a fluid having a well defined friction loss behavior.

AB  - ABSTRACT In the present work a continuous model for fluid-particle flow computation is presented; the effects of particles are taken into account in terms of an effective viscosity, whereas the dispersed phase equation closure is simply based on particles buoyancy. The proposed approach allows the study of sediment transport without the need of curvilinear co-ordinate systems and the related step-by-step regridding, to describe accurately the evolution of bed forms. In fact in the present model the bottom shape is described in terms of a density contour line, rather then a moving boundary of the fluid domain. Numerical properties of discrete schemes for convective transport were carefully investigated by suitable test cases. The model has been validated in comparison with a Lagrangian approach, in the simple case of settling particles in a Couette flow. INTRODUCTION The transport of sediments in a flowing current is one of the most important and less understood problems even though it has a fundamental relevance in many practical applications; these range from erosion processes in coastal and fiver engineering up to separation of particles and dynamics of suspensions in the chemical industry. The interaction between fluid and particles is a very complicated phenomenon owing to the dynamical feedback between the two phases and even for simple configurations the relationship between the fluid velocity and the mass transport it not known with reasonable accuracy. Even Einstein fated to tread in the sediment transport since he is reputed to have told his son << ... Son, don''t mess with that, it''s far too complicated ... >> [1]. These problems can be attacked from two different viewpoints: a Lagrangian (discrete) or a Eulerian (continuous) approach.

AB  - ABSTRACTNormal stress-fracture closure variation and stress-dependent fluid flow rates were calculated for rock fractures of different aperture distributions. This study shows that both the mechanical and hydraulic properties of the fracture are controlled by the large-scale roughness of the rock fracture. Hence the typical large-scale undulation wavelength of the rock joint dictates the suitable sample size to be used in normal stress and fluid-flow measurements, if results due purely to sample size are to be avoided. INTRODUCTIONWe present a study in which the fracture closure and fluid flow properties of the fracture when subjected to normal stress were correlated to the roughness characteristics of the fracture walls. The calculations for this investigation were based on an earlier model of ours (Tsang and witherspoon, 1981) in which a mathematical expression was derived to relate the nonlinear effective Young's modulus of a rough-walled fracture to the fracture-roughness profile. In that earlier work we deduced from normal stress-displacement data of fractures, the fracture-roughness profile and in turn the fluid flow through such a fracture as a function of normal stress. The agreement obtained between the predicted flow and the measured flow lends validity to the theory. In the present study, we started with different fractures of known roughness profile and calculated their stress-displacement and stress-flow properties. The aim is to find correlations between the geometrical characteristics of the fracture roughness and the fracture mechanical and fluid-flow properties. METHODFigure 1 is reproduced from Figure 9 of Bandis, Lumsden, and Barton (1981). It shows a selection of joint surface profiles from natural exposures of sandstone, siltstone, and limestone. Note that the profile of each joint surface is characterized by a large-scale undulation on which is superposed a small-scale roughness, whose average amplitude and wavelength are both much smaller than that of the large-scale undulation. These profiles range from rough undulation to almost smooth and planar. If each joint surface profile were to represent both the top and bottom halves of a fracture, then different fracture apertures may be simulated from each profile when the upper and lower joints are mismatched in varying degrees. Figure 2 shows four different variations that were generated from the same joint surface profile (1 in Fig. 1). The fractures in Figure 2 a,b,c,d were constructed by a horizontal displacement to the right of the top joint with respect to the lower joint by fractions varying from 0.013, 0.03, 0.056, 0.17, respectively, of the entire profile length; plus enough upward displacement of the top joint to ensure that there was no overlap between the upper and lower profiles. The fracture closes under increasing normal stress, causing the crack lengths of the voids to shorten. The effective Young's modulus of the fractured jointed rock, Eeff, on the other hand, increases with increased normal stress on the fracture to approach the value of the constant Young's modulus, E, of the intact rock. The integrand on the right-hand side of (4) can be computed from the geometry of the fracture profile.

AB  - AbstractWith oil and gas operators now focusing on smaller assets to develop, every opportunity to reduce costs, with due consideration to safety is being carefully considered.By derating the transportation flowline substantial cost savings are possible. In the past this would not have been allowed for safety reasons, as the flowline was required to be rated to the maximum pressure from the reservoir.HIPPS is a new subsea technology which allows the high pressure specification flowlines to be safely derated between the manifold and host platform. This is achieved by reliably isolating the high pressure product before the specification break of the lower pressure rated flowline.The system is designed to failsafe under all operating conditions. Commercial evaluations are given to justifi the technology. The HIPPS control system is described in detail together with summarized reliability data.IntroductionHigh Pressure/High Temperature (HP/HT) subsea hydrocarbon developments are now being actively pursued in many Central North Sea areas. These prospects tend not to be large reserves but may have Closed In Tubing Head Pressures (CITHP) in the region of 10,000 psi. This leads to marginal economics of such fields, when the cost of higher specification flowlines are taken into account.Subsea HIPPS presents an option for justifying HP/HT developments, by allowing high pressure flowlines to be derated to standard pressure flowlines, at considerable overall cost savings.The HIPPS system provides a reliable failsafe means to protect and isolate the derated flowline at the subsea installation from the high pressure at the wellhead. HIPPS works in parallel with the standard control and safety systems, which would all need to I before HIPPS comes into operation. HIPPS also allows potential cost savings in the topside piping system and a reduction in the platform risk levels by a reduction in system pressure.The control system for subsea HIPPS is separate from the well control system for the subsea equipment having dedicated power, communication and hydraulic lines, These may be shared in a common umbilical with the production control system, and are integrated into the surface control computer and hydraulic/electrical supply units.Typical costs savings for a step-out distance of 9 km can be in the region of UK E13 million compared to a fully rated flowline system. This saving may be reduced by selecting a ?no burst' option in order to maximise safety considerations. Based on thorough reliability and risk assessment models Ref. 1 it has been shown the subsea system is extremely safe with the risk of a flowline failure in the order of 1.7E-04 per annum or once per 5900 years.The control hardware used for subsea HIPPS is based on a thoroughly proven topside, certified fixed logic HIPPS system, which has then been marinised for subsea use. The principle feature for the safety critical controller is its ability for failsafe operation under all modes of failure.

AB  - Abstract Reservoir simulation workflows from history to prediction are built on a number of alternative optimization and sampling techniques with different characteristics. Adjoint techniques derive analytical sensitivities directly from the flow equations of the simulator. In a model update step those sensitivities are used for property modifications on grid cell level. Derivative-free optimization techniques like evolutionary algorithms are flexible and deliver alternative history matched cases. The propagation of reservoir uncertainties from history to prediction is often investigated using ensemble-based approaches. Markov Chain Monte Carlo and EnKF techniques are applied to generate an approximate posterior distribution as a basis for estimating prediction uncertainties. In this work we investigate alternative optimization, sampling and data assimilation techniques with application to history matching workflows within one application framework for comparison. Validated simulation models are used for production forecast and field development planning. Methods are investigated with a focus on history matching efficiency, flexibility to integrate different types of model parameters, integration option for static and dynamic modeling workflows, capability of supporting uncertainty quantification workflows for estimating prediction uncertainties and the ability to leverage on distributed computing. Optimization workflows are applied to a reasonably complex benchmark problem for comparison. Well production data is used in the model calibration phase and history matched simulation models are carried forward to prediction. The impact of alternative optimization concepts on estimating prediction uncertainties is discussed. This work gives an overview on alternative optimization concepts and relates capabilities, strengths and weaknesses. The impact of workflow choices on estimating prediction uncertainties is discussed. Practical conclusions are drawn for real field applications scenarios.

AB  - This paper presents two numerical methods, a vortex lattice method (MPUF#x002D;3A) coupled with a finite volume method (GBFLOW#x002D;3D) and a boundary element method (PROPCAV), which are applied to predict time#x002D;averaged sheet cavitation on rudders, including the effects of the propeller as well as of the tunnel walls. The coupled MPUF#x002D;3A and GBFLOW#x002D;3D determines the velocity field due to the propeller within the fluid domain bounded by tunnel walls. MPUF#x002D;3A solves the potential flow around the propeller by distributing the line vortices and sources on the blade mean camber surface and determines the pressure distributions on the blade surface. GBFLOW#x002D;3D solves Euler equations with the body force terms converted from the pressure distributions on the blade surface and determines the total velocity field inside the fluid domain. The tunnel walls are treated as a solid boundary by applying the slip boundary condition, and the propeller blades are modeled via body forces. The two methods are solved iteratively until the forces on the blade converge. The cavity prediction on the rudder is accomplished via PROPCAV, which can handle back and face leading edge or mid#x002D;chord cavitation, in the presence of the three#x002D;dimensional flow field determined by the coupled MPUF#x002D;3A and GBFLOW#x002D;3D. The present method is validated by comparing the cavity shapes and the cavity envelope with those observed and measured in experiment and computed by another method.

AB  - SummaryThis paper summarizes the methods used to compare the risk of a blowout for a well completion with a subsurface safety valve (SSSV) to a completion without an SSSV. These methods, which could be applied to any field, include a combination of SSSV reliability and conventional risk analyses. The Kuparuk River Unit Working-Interest Owners recently formed a group to examine the risks associated with installing and maintaining SSSV's in the Kuparuk field. Considering Kuparuk field operating conditions, the group was charged with determining whether SSSV's are a safety asset or whether the numerous operating and maintenance procedures make them a safety liability. The results indicate that, for the Kuparuk River Unit, an SSSV becomes a safety liability when the mean time between SSSV failures is less than 1 year. Because current SSSV mean time to failure (MTTF) at Kuparuk is approximately 1,000 days, they are considered a safety asset IntroductionThe use of SSSV's in onshore North Slope development wells was adopted as a statutory requirement to prevent oil spills caused by casing collapse in a permafrost environment. The primary reason for installing an SSSV in a well completion is to reduce the risk of a blowout, an uncontrolled flow of well fluid to the environment. However, a number of wireline and workover operations specifically conducted to service SSSV's in an individual well are likely. These operations, in turn, represent additional risk of a blowout. A typical risk analysis was used to compare risk with and without SSSV'S. The steps of the analysis are as follows. 1. Define the equipment system, in this case the two alternative well completions to be studied. 2. Develop the possible failure modes that could affect the reliability of the system. 3. Build a fault tree to describe these failure relations. 4. Develop component failure rates for each branch of the fault tree, including the development of the relationship of SSSV availability to the other components of the fault tree. 5. Calculate the total failure probability as a function of SSSV MTTF. Not all the component failure rates were derived easily because of the nature of the data required. Thus some of the failure rates are based on engineering judgment. This does not affect greatly the comparison of two very similar well completions, because the relative failure rate is more important than the absolute failure rate. When a component failure rate appeared to have significant influence on the results a range of values was used in the calculation. System Definition The standard production well completion for the Kuparuk field (Fig. 1) has a tubing-retrievable subsurface safety valve (TRSSSV) installed at approximately 2,000 ft [610 m] measured depth below the surface. In the rare event of a TRSSSV failure, the first repair method is by wireline manipulation. If this is unsuccessful, the TRSSSV is locked in the open position, and a wireline-retrievable subsurface safety valve (WRSSSV) is used as an insert inside the TRSSSV. If the WRSSSV fails, it can be retrieved and replaced by wireline operations. If the failed WRSSSV cannot be retrieved or repaired, however, a workover is required. A workover is required also in the event of a leak in the subsurface hydraulic control line. These Kuparuk field operational procedures were analyzed and used to develop the well-system model under study. System Failure Modes To analyze the completion reliability, the possible failure mechanisms were identified. These included completion equipment failure, operational failures, and several catastrophic events, such as drilling-rig derrick collapse, plane crash, and vehicle collision into wellheads. Certain plane crash, and vehicle collision into wellheads. Certain risks that could not be quantified-such as acts of war, acts of sabotage, and acts of God (earthquakes, etc.) were omitted from the study. Fault Tree Development The application of fault-tree risk analysis to well completion systems is well documented by Woodward. The reliability of a component or system of components is the probability that it will perform its functions for a specified probability that it will perform its functions for a specified time interval and is predicted generally by a single-parameter exponential distribution: (1) where R(t) is the probability the component will operate without failure for time period t under the stated operating conditions.

AB  - SummaryVarious types of supervisory-control and data-acquisition (SCADA) systems are in use in oil fields around the world, assisting field personnel in maintaining safe and profitable operations. The Upper Zakum personnel in maintaining safe and profitable operations. The Upper Zakum field, one of the largest offshore fields, requires a far more extensive SCADA system with higher levels of distribution than generally needed, This paper outlines the environment and extent of the field, emphasizing the paper outlines the environment and extent of the field, emphasizing the need for unmanned operation and the evolution of the Zakum telesystem to meet the special requirements. Specification and predesign phases are shown to be vitally important parts of the project, in both assessing the telesystem's final extent and predicting what the field operators need to control the field. The telesystem implementation is described in detail, including system architecture, operator facilities, hardware and software considerations, and various interfaces with other systems. The problems encountered during the project and their solutions are discussed, and conclusions are drawn for future projects. The need for the highest available level of technology and the likely consequences of compromising this need because of cost considerations are also discussed. Finally, recommendations are proposed for future selection of large-scale SCADA systems.IntroductionThe Zakum Development Co. (Zadco) was set up in 1977, following the decision of the government of Abu Dhabi to develop and to produce oil from the Upper Zakum oil field. Because of the large extent and nature of the field, it was divided into four zones, each with wellhead platforms connected to a central satellite separator platform. These satellite platforms, in turn, were connected to a platform. These satellite platforms, in turn, were connected to a huge central complex, where all utility plants are located.Supervision and control of all wellhead platforms, unmanned satellite separator platforms, and the central complex were envisaged to be carried out from a single control center situated at the top of the accommodation platform by a small team of operators. Therefore, a large SCADA system (telesystem) was needed to ensure uninterrupted safe production.The Upper Zakum field is now under production, and the telesystem provides supervision and control of the field and plants from a single control center, largely fulfilling design objectives.Field DescriptionUpper Zakum Oil Field. The Upper Zakum field (Fig. 1), situated about 70 km offshore Abu Dhabi, covers an area of about 50 x 30 km. The Abu Dhabi Natl. Oil Corp. oversees the project, and Total Compagnie Francaise des Petroles manages it. The field overlies the lower Zakum reservoir, operated by a separate company using separate facilities. The nearby island of Zirku was selected for processing and storage installations.Water depth in the field is typically 10 to 20 m, with 1-m waves. The climate is difficult: temperatures reach 45 degrees C, and humidity, which varies rapidly, can be 100%. Occasional sandstorms occur, and any moisture has a high saline content.Because it covers a large area, the field has a low wellhead flowing pressure (WHFP)-typically 1.38 MPa-but does not have HIS. pressure (WHFP)-typically 1.38 MPa-but does not have HIS. Platforms. Wellhead Platforms. Seventy-five wellhead platforms Platforms. Wellhead Platforms. Seventy-five wellhead platforms were built to provide production and/or injection for the entire field. The three basic designs are for three, six, and nine drilling slots. Each slot is assigned to production or injection, depending on reservoir requirements. Production wells are completed with two production strings each. production strings each. In addition, 33 wellhead platforms are equipped with test separators to allow remote measurement of the GOR of any producing string.Satellite Platforms. For operational convenience, and because of low WHFP, the field is divided into four zones. The wellhead platforms are connected to a satellite separation platform in each platforms are connected to a satellite separation platform in each zone. Of the four satellite platforms (Fig. 2), three are remote from the field's central complex. These satellite platforms perform gas/oil separation and transfer gas and oil to the Central complex by separate pipelines. The satellite platforms also are the distribution point for pipelines. The satellite platforms also are the distribution point for injection water to the wellhead platforms in each zone.

AB  - Abstract A common cause of failure with surface-controlled, subsurface safety valves (SC-SSSV) is a defect in the down-hole hydraulic line, which controls the valve from the surface. Such a failure generates production losses and requires the intervention of a costly workover rig - usually not immediately available. In order to alleviate this type of situation, a system has been developed where the physical control line has been replaced by a communication system based on electromagnetic waves. The surface emitter continuously sends a signal to the SC-SSSV. Both items are designed to be fail-safe. The normally-closed valve remains open while receiving the signal and closes as soon as the signal is lost. This innovative, control-line free, wireline-retrievable SC-SSSV can be set in any landing nipple profile or anywhere in the tubing using monobore lock technology without a workover or well head modification. The primary application is to secure wells with a damaged or blocked control line, damaged landing nipple, or wells completed without an SC-SSSV. It provides an immediate cost-effective solution - allowing production to resume with a surface-controllable safety barrier while avoiding or postponing a costly workover. With the arrival of this technology, sub-standard and temporary solutions, such as the normally-open velocity and ambient valves, no longer need to be considered. Another application is to free up a hydraulic SC-SSSV landing nipple in order to install a device like a capillary string for chemical or gas injection at the bottom of the well safely. A prototype has been built and successfully tested for six months in a flowing gas well with 15% H2S - the case history is presented. The tool has proven to be easy to install and reliable. Deployment will start in 2008. Thousands of wells are concerned around the world. This breakthrough slickline product offers new possibilities for safely and efficiently managing the countless failures of hydraulic SC-SCSSVs. Its versatility brings a reduction in production losses and provides the user with a cost-effective and reliable solution. Introduction LACQ field has been developed from 1951 to 1957 while solving metallurgical constraint due to the 15% H2S and 10% CO2 in its gas composition. At few kilometers, MEILLON, SAINT FAUST and PONT D'AS fields which produce the same long and narrow reservoir have started production late 1967.

AB  - SummaryThis paper describes the de-sign features of a surface lateral tree and compares the design with a conventional Christmas tree. A lateral Christmas tree is defined as a tree which has no valves in the vertical bore of the tree, and flow through the tree is controlled by valves on the lateral or horizontal bore of the tree. Preliminary evaluations indicate that the use of a surface lateral tree can enhance well intervention procedures, reduce wellhead/tree height, reduce maintenance requirements, and reduce overall risks. IntroductionThe use of lateral trees has been limited in the past. A type of lateral tree has been used on some land producing wells and several land based subsurface storage wells. For these installations, fluids are produced from and/or injected down an annulus through a side outlet in the casing head. Flow in the innermost bore or the tubing is generally controlled with conventional in-line valves. These applications are considered a combination of lateral and conventional configurations. The use of a true lateral tree in which all vertical in-line valves are omitted has been generally limited to low risk, artificially lifted wells. Recently, it was announced that lateral trees would be installed subsea as part of an upcoming North Sea development. The subsea lateral tree is expected to improve installation/workover procedures by eliminating the need for a complex workover equipment package. Overall, it is anticipated that the subsea lateral tree will offer advantages in cost operability and safety. Since some of the advantages of the subsea installation apply to surface installations, Phillips Petroleum Company United Kingdom Limited conducted an evaluation to determine the feasibility of using surface lateral trees on an offshore platform on an upcoming Central North Sea development project. At the present time, lateral trees have not been installed on an offshore platform well. Well intervention through conventional trees is sometimes difficult. It is necessary to establish reliable well bore barriers prior to installing a lubricator assembly for wireline work or to removing the tree to allow the installation of a blowout preventer (BOP) stack. Wells equipped with conventional trees have several undesirable features from both an operational and a safety point of view: 1. The tree has to be removed prior to installing BOP's and pulling the downhole completion. It is necessary to establish additional barriers in the well to carry out this operation. Generally, wireline plugs are set in the tubing and/or the tubing hanger. In some cases, the plug will not set and/or seal due to debris, corrosion or scale. When the additional barrier can not be established using plugs, the tested barrier system may have to be compromised. In other cases, the plug becomes stuck during the time the plug is set, the tree is removed and the BOP's arc installed. Plugs are sometimes impossible to retrieve after installing the new completion and christmas tree. Setting and retrieving the plugs can be a time consuming and costly exercise.

AB  - ABSTRACT: Measurements of wellbore fluid dynamics such as fluid velocity and pressure are widely used to monitor downhole production. There is a wealth of information in these measurements about static and dynamic petrophysical properties of producing rock formations. We introduce a new method to interpret dynamic petrophysical properties of rock formations from measurements acquired with production logging tools (PLT). The specific application considered in this paper estimates formation permeability from production logging (PL) measurements. To that end, we develop a coupled wellbore-reservoir model to simultaneously simulate the physics of fluid flow both in the borehole and in permeable formations which are in hydraulic communication with the borehole. Our interpretation method uses the concept of computational fluid dynamics to simulate fluid flow in the wellbore. Though the developed wellbore model is capable of simulating two-phase flow systems, in this paper, we assume single-phase, Newtonian, and incompressible fluid flow through the borehole and solve one- and two-dimensional versions of the Navier-Stokes equations in cylindrical coordinates. Subsequently, we interface the borehole fluid flow model with a reservoir flow model and use the resulting coupled model to simulate PL measurements. Permeability estimation is performed by minimizing the difference between measurements of fluid pressure and velocity and their corresponding numerical simulations. Synthetic cases are used to appraise the accuracy and reliability of the permeability estimation method. We find that the accuracy of the estimation decreases in the presence of thin layering. Additionally, it is shown that unaccounted two-phase fluid flow in the borehole yields estimates of permeability closed to those of relative permeability to the dominant fluid phase. Finally, testing of the estimation method on field data acquired in the deepwater Gulf of Mexico, yields formation permeabilities that are in agreement with well-log derived permeabilities.

AB  - AbstractIt is a challenge to provide a 10 year or longer service life for the corrosion protection of FPSO's. While traditional trading vessels will dock regularly (every 5th year), the FPSO will be in continuous operation during its service life. Today the basic corrosion protection requirements used on FPSO's are often based on established guidelines used for the trading vessels. Consequently, there is a need to develop a guideline for the corrosion protection for fixed floating vessels with a 10 years or longer service life. The paper provides a schematic presentation of the guideline /1/.The technology basis for the guideline is the state-of-the-art knowledge on corrosion protection of fixed offshore platforms and experiences from the marine industry. For cathodic protection, the design shall be based on a combination with coatings. KeywordsFPSO, Corrosion protection, coatings, cathodic protectionIntroductionThe main objective of the guideline /1/ is to achieve a long service life (10 years or longer) for the corrosion protection systems with minimal maintenance during service. Coatings are the main corrosion protection of the low alloy steel of the hull on an FPSO (floating production and storage units). For submerged areas of the external hull and in ballast tanks and other tanks containing seawater, cathodic protection (CP) is used as a supplementary protection. A combination of CP with coatings is specified as necessity for achieving a cost effective protection for a service life of 10 years or longer.The longevity of the applied coating system depends on tasks related to surface preparation and coating application. The requirements for adequate surface preparation, a stringent limit to the salt content on the surface, and the use of only prequalified coating systems are critical factors for achieving a service life of 10 years or longer. Coatings for global service: Qualification requirementsThe environmental conditions for a floating offshore structure range from tropical to artic. This will implytemperature conditions from below freezing to tropical conditions at temperatures around 30°C. The humidity conditions may be expected to be close to 100% for all offshore areas for most temperatures. A high impact from sunlight (e.g. UV-light) can be expected at the tropical locations. To ensure that a coating product will have the ability to provide a 10 year or longer global service life, the selected coating product shall be qualified. For a coating qualification program, the relevant exposure conditions must be included. Consequently for the external hull surface above the waterline, the coating must have a high resistance to UV, while a submerged coating must be compatible with cathodic protection. To ensure that a coating product will have the ability to provide a 10 year or longer service life, such a qualification shall be done based on one of the two: Documentation of the given coating product from previous experience Performing a pre-qualification testing programIn the case that qualification is to be based on a prequalification testing program, the following standards are recommended: ISO 20340(2003)" Paints and varnishes- Performance requirements for protective paint systems for offshore and related structures" /2/ Tanker Structure Co-operative Forum. " Guidelines for ballast tank coating systems and surface preparation" /3/ Appendix 3 -Testing and classification of ballast tank coatings)

AB  - Abstract This paper describes how Ocean Power Technologies (OPT) successfully transferred technology developed in the Renewables sector to Defence and is currently repeating this process for the Oil & Gas (O&G) market, providing solutions that could drive down project OPEX & CAPEX to help make current fields that offer low commercial returns more attractive for development. OPT describes the core enabling technology viz a moored, floating buoy which harvests wave energy and uses a proprietary energy management system to deliver persistent power and communications over long period multiyear deployments. It will describe a versatile marine platform which enables a wide variety of new application solutions. The system is known as an APB-350. The results of the latest deployment of the APB-350 are described, illustrating the ability to deploy remote, inocean sensors and communications for subsea applications, and demonstrating the rugged survivability of the device. It will be shown that the technology can deliver to operators a cost effective, safe, reliable, persistent power and communication platform that has the potential to reduce operational costs and improve overall production performance. Specifically, where development would traditionally require high cost power delivery systems, the technology can provide an economic solution where previously the cost was prohibitive. Potential applications are discussed in collaboration with Premier Oil such as: ? UUV garages for in permanent infield monitoring/inspection of assets ? The control of electric trees for CO2/water field injection ? Environmental monitoring for pre-post deployment ? Real-time on site field monitoring/sensing systems for 4D reservoir analysis and pre/post deployment surveys ? Security Cordons for offshore developments ? Temporary navigational markers for surface & submerged structures Conclusions will be drawn regarding how the transfer approach used will benefit the oil and gas industry, to improve current operations and deliver alternative, more cost effective solutions. The ability to power alternate sensor packages and high power delivery functions, will enable operators to obtain, real-time data for remote field operations; thus allowing remote real-time asset management and enabling better monitoring and control of overall performance and safety.

AB  - Summary Efficiency and economics have motivated RasGas Trains 3 through 5 to implement a novel compressor-driver arrangement comprising both propane and mixed-refrigerant (MR) compressors on a single shaft. One Frame 7E gas turbine drives the low-pressure (LP) and medium-pressure (MP) MR compressors, while a second Frame 7E drives the propane and high-pressure (HP) MR machines. With minor control system adjustments after startup, the refrigerant compressors in RasGas Train 3 are operating reliably. Introduction The propane precooled mixed refrigerant (C3MR) process developed by Air Products has been the dominant process technology employed in the liquefied natural gas (LNG) industry for more than 30 years. This process uses a propane refrigerant system to chill the feed gas from ambient temperature to approximately -33°C and an MR to chill the gas to LNG temperatures. Because pure propane is used in the precooling refrigeration cycle, the minimum temperature of this cycle is limited to the boiling temperature of propane near atmospheric pressure. The total duty that can be transferred to the propane refrigerant is thereby naturally limited to heat that can be transferred within this range. Because of the propane's limited temperature range, one of the characteristics of the C3MR process arrangement is that the MR refrigeration system requires nearly double the compression power of the propane refrigeration system. The actual difference depends on the number of propane stages, the ambient conditions, the environmental cooling medium, and other process arrangements. To drive these refrigeration compressors, early LNG plants used steam turbines that could be sized to fit the required service (e.g., Marsa el Brega). Later projects determined that gas-turbine drivers were a more efficient and less costly option for driving the compressors.   For procurement, maintainability, and sparing purposes, an operating facility would prefer to have each of the compression services driven by the same type and model of gas-turbine driver. For the C3MR process, such an arrangement is typically inconvenient because of the inherent power consumption mismatch between the propane and MR services.

AB  - Abstract This paper will present work that has been completed over the last several years to develop an all electric Subsea control system ending with an all electric tree. The work is now conducted in a joint StatoilHydro-FMC Technologies R&D program; Subsea MMX. All electric systems provide CAPEX savings from reduced umbilical, OPEX savings from eliminating fluid consumption, and environmental benefits from eliminating emissions of hydraulic fluids. The basis system discussed in this paper is currently in use for Subsea Choke Control and Manifold Valve Control, and it won the OTC Technology Award in 2006. This system is now further refined for application on safety critical applications like Christmas Tree valves with improved redundancy and fault tolerance in order to meet requirements for safety and availability. This paper will discuss the analytical development and review of the safety critical electric tree system, as well as describe the technical solutions developed. The development have taken into account the standardisation efforts by the Subsea industry regarding control system interfaces and are compatible with the IWIS and SIIS RP standards. Introduction The Electric Tree system was derived from the already field proven All Electric System that so far have been controlling choke and manifold valves on the StatoilHydro operated fields Statfjord and Norne.

AB  - ABSTRACTAmong several wind farm layout design parameters, the inter-turbine spacing, which has a great influence on aerodynamic power output, wind speed deficit, lifetime, wake vortex structure, is one of the most critical factors. Therefore, the effects of inter-turbine spacing on aerodynamics for wind farms must be carefully studied. In this study, Considering the uniform inflow conditions, the effects of inter-turbine spacing changing from three to nine times of rotor diameter on aerodynamics for wind farms containing two NREL 5MW baseline wind turbines in tandem layout are analyzed using actuator line model and CFD method, and the RANS equation with k-ω SST turbulence model was solved in the simulations conducted in the OpenFOAM. From the study, it is concluded that the inter-turbine spacing has significant effects on the aerodynamic power and wake characteristics. The aerodynamic power output of the downstream wind turbine exits sharp fluctuation before power output of the downstream wind turbine is becoming steady. Furthermore, periodic oscillation whose period is about the one-third of rotor rotating period can be also concluded from the study. Moreover, there is strong wake interaction which will impact the aerodynamics for wind farms seriously.INTRODUCTIONWind energy is a promising renewable energy resource to help handle the environmental pollution caused by the extended use of fossil fuel. Wind farms, which have large capacity to contain plenty of wind turbines, are becoming the main electrical energy source. Since the broader application of wind energy, the layout design of wind farm is becoming significant (Chio, 2014). The layout design of wind farms that affects the initial investment cost, annual energy production, operation and maintenance cost during the service lifetime of wind turbines is a key factor (Kusiak, 2010). Among several wind farm layout design parameters, the inter-turbine spacing, which has a great influence on aerodynamic power output, wind speed deficit, lifetime, wake vortex structure, is one of the most critical factors. We can know that, if the distance between two turbines is too small, there will be seriously effects on downstream turbines due to the strong wake interference, which will cause immeasurable drop of power output and stand higher loads on turbines experiencing wakes compared to those experiencing free stream flows (Barthelmie, 2009). Therefore, the effects of inter-turbines spacing on aero-dynamics for wind farms must be carefully considered to fully study the aerodynamic power out, the wake characteristics and axial speed deficit, specially the wake interaction phenomenon.

AB  - AbstractThe problem of annular pressure build-up due to heating of the strings by the (hot) well effluent, will typically be of concern in the design of casing strings for HP/HT subsea wells. In such completions bleeding off the pressure through the wellhead, as done routinely with surface wells, is not possible.Theoretical studies indicated that, potentially, extreme pressures could develop in confined sealed annuli of subsea completions, posing a severe threat to well integrity. To investigate the effect under realistic conditions, Shell Expro (UK) ran battery operated gauges in the 9 5/8" X 13 5/8" annulus of an offshore HP/HT well, to record pressure and temperature changes during drilling, cementing and production testing.This paper presents the results of these tests and a general model for pressure build-up in unconfined sealed annuli to correlate the field data. Since only pressure and temperature measurements were available certain assumptions had to be made with respect to e.g. formation response to pressure build-up, in situ liquid properties etc. Although these assumptions could be debatable, it is hoped that by publishing and sharing ideas, a better understanding of annular pressure behaviour can be developed.IntroductionThe problem of annular pressure build-up due to fluid heating during production, in the sealed annuli of (HP/HT) subsea completions, has been addressed by various authors (see e.g. [1], [2]). Most theoretical treatises consider the annular fluids to be perfectly confined between the casings. In view of the incompressible nature of these fluids small changes in temperature, annular volume etc. lead to considerable changes in pressure in completely tight annuli. Hence, most model calculations predicted that extreme pressures could, potentially, develop in confined sealed annuli. Obviously, when this is taken into account in casing design for deep HP/HT wells, thick walled casing has to be selected to withstand the anticipated burst and collapse loads. In turn this gives rise to considerably increased requirements with respect to offshore rig capacity, maximum deck load etc.In order to avoid the problem, Shell Expro (UK) adapted the policy of not cementing a casing up to the shoe of the previous casing, so that pressure could, in principle, bleed off to surrounding formations. A theoretical basis for this policy was lacking however. Such a basis, which includes the effect of liquid leakoff on annulus pressure is presented in the next chapter.To validate theoretical expressions a dedicated field test with an instrumented casing string was carried out in an offshore HP/HT exploration well. The results of this test and a comparison with model calculations are presented. Finally, in view of the implications of these results for casing design, in particular for subsea wells, recommendations for further research will be discussed.

AB  - AbstractThe stress path experienced by a rock mass, during and immediately after excavation is complex and cannot be replicated by a simple loading of samples to induce microcracking. We have simulated excavation stresses in the laboratory by true-triaxial unloading. To do this we have utilised an existing polyaxial system at Imperial College and modified it to undertake acoustic emission (AE) monitoring. We have then used triaxial strain, measurements, three- dimensional ultrasonic surveys and Ali studies to investigate laboratory induced cracking. In particular we have developed and applied a moment tensor inversion procedure to located AE. This allows a direct analysis of the mechanics driving the cracking. We present and compare results from two tests (triaxial loading and triaxial unloading) using Springwell sandstone to show the capabilities of the laboratory and processing techniques. The AE source mechanisms in both tests are shown tu have a significant isotropic component. The mechanics of the cracking fits neither a Mode I tensile or shear source, but a combination of the two. The mechanism orientations agree with cracking parallel to .P. 509

AB  - ABSTRACTThis paper presents the results of wind load CFD calculations performed on the simplified topside structures of a drillship. The CFD calculations were carried out for two configurations: with and without the drilling derrick. The CFD calculations were performed at model scale and by applying an atmospheric boundary layer profile. The full range of heading angles was considered. In order to validate the CFD model for wind load calculations, the CFD results were compared with the wind tunnel measurements which were carried out at BMT Boundary Layer Wind Tunnel in London, UK, for the same drillship model and configurations. Furthermore, the applied boundary layer profiles throughout the computational domain were verified and compared with those profiles measured in the wind tunnel. It was found that the CFD results are in good agreement with the wind tunnel measurements and provide valuable insights into the physics of wind loads acting on the topside structures of a drillship.INTRODUCTIONThe design of a drillship requires the prediction of the loads generated by wind on the topside structures. The typical topside structures of a drillship consist of part of the hull, a large forward accommodation block with a helideck above it, several large structures and equipment on the deck, a drilling derrick or tower and several cranes, resulting in a considerably large wind-exposed area. It is critically important to accurately predict the wind loads on a drillship for station keeping and stability purposes. The wind loads are known to be the governing load factor in drillship stability (Mendonca Santos and Alves, 2016).In the early design stage, the wind loads are usually estimated by empirical methods which are given by for example the classification society rules such as the IMO MODU code (IMO, 2009). The classification rules are based on the building block model. The total wind loads on the drillship are calculated by summing up the forces of each component and taking into account the projected area, shape and elevation levels. This method is efficient and fast but usually the level of accuracy is low and depends on whether the drillship under consideration can be represented by the building block model. When higher accuracy is required during the design process, wind tunnel measurements are commonly carried out. However, the ability to predict the wind loads using CFD at the design stage is of particular interest. Because in CFD not only the wind loads can be predicted, but also valuable insights can be obtained into the flow behavior through visualization of the flow field.

AB  - Abstract IEC 61511 requires periodic proof testing of SIFs to demonstrate the correct operation of the loop elements based on Safety Instrumented Function (SIF) design criteria to maintain Safety Integrity Level (SIL) ratings. Proof test serves three primary purposes within the safety lifecycle: To catch and overcome the failures in the system. To validate SIF integrity and reliability To record and classify failures in a consistent manner to support future analysis. Challenges with implementing a new or modified approach to testing of Safety Instrumented System (SIS) instruments include issues such as education of participants, integrating the new proof testing procedures with the current maintenance plans and schedule, and documenting failures identified outside of testing. It is critical to create an implementation plan that deals with these challenges ahead of pushing SIS proof testing to facilities. This paper will: Identify methods to achieve maximum % proof test coverage Proper planning and scheduling Review guiding principles upon which proof tests be developed.

AB  - Abstract There are more than 100 accumulations in the southern North Sea that are flagged as stranded fields. Tight reservoirs, distant infrastructure, small volumes, and anomalous gas qualities are amongst the main reasons why these resources have not yet been developed. One of these stranded tight gas fields has been successfully developed with the use of a subsea well, horizontal drilling, and hydraulic fracturing. The Kew structure is a northwest/southeast trending horst straddling licenses 49/4c, 49/4a, 49/5a, and 49/5b of the UK sector approximately 2 km east of the Chiswick field. The primary reservoir objectives are the Carboniferous sandstones of the Caister formation (Westphalian  A). This gas field has now been developed with a singlewell that employs a combination of horizontal drilling and multistage hydraulic fracturing to achieve maximum reservoir contact in this low-permeability and interbedded structure. The absence of data and analogue wells for the design and execution of the fracturing treatments necessitated extended injection tests prior to the execution of the stimulation treatments. To maximize the data acquired from this well, chemical tracers were injected during the stimulation treatments and returns evaluated to assess the flowback of each individual hydraulic fracture. As this was a subsea development well, all the hydraulic fracturing operations had to be performed with the rig in place. Hence, the utmost efficiency of the operations was paramount; otherwise, the economics of the project would be negatively impacted. Innovative techniques of isolation between each fracturing stage were developed to minimize the risk and decrease completion time. The time of massive gas field discoveries has passed, and smaller developments are proving to be the future, through tying them to existing assets, to boost gas production in the North Sea and extend the life of the existing infrastructure. This challenge was successfully addressed for the Kew field by combining existing technologies and developing new techniques.

AB  - AbstractThis paper presents an overview of the Canyon Express umbilical and control system which extends 56 miles from a host platform in Main Pass Block 261 to connect three deepwater gas fields in the Mississippi Canyon and Desoto Canyon Areas of the Gulf of Mexico - King's Peak (6500 fsw), Aconcagua (7000 fsw), and Camden Hills (7200 fsw) - operated by BP, TotalFinaElf, and Marathon Oil, respectively. The Canyon Express control system is a hybrid fiber optic / electro-hydraulic multiplex system designed for 11 wells, with the primary operator interface being a dual PC Master Control Station (MCS) installed at the host facility. The umbilical system, which connects the host facility to each subsea well, provides for electrical power, signal control, hydraulic supply, chemical injection, well annulus monitoring, servicing via dedicated service line, and methanol injection (infield umbilicals only). Methanol supply to each field is via a separate Single Methanol Distribution Line (SMDL) and powered system of subsea metering valves. The paper will emphasize technical challenges and lessons-learned during the design, manufacture, and installation of this deepwater umbilical and control system. The technical challenges and lessons presented in this paper can be directly applied to future subsea oil and gas developments, particularly long offsets in deepwater.Canyon Express demonstrates that the state of technology existing in the industry today is generally in line with the control system requirements of such projects. However, improvements can be made in the design, qualification and testing of components to enhance reliability in deepwater applications. Lessons-learned on this project include issues relating to electrical and electro-optical connectors, umbilical cable terminations, chemical metering valves, and testing during installation.This paper enhances industry knowledge by focusing on the specific issues related to the successful deployment of a deepwater umbilical and control system. Specifically, consideration is given to how lessons-learned relate to system design issues such as reliability and redundancy. Component qualification, interface management, integration of umbilical terminations, installation challenges, and field fault finding, are also considered. The lessons presented can be used to improve deployment of similar systems for future subsea developments.IntroductionThe Canyon Express deepwater umbilical and control system, which originates from the Canyon Station platform in Main Pass Block 261, is designed to monitor and control subsea production from three deepwater gas fields in the Mississippi Canyon and Desoto Canyon Areas of the Gulf of Mexico " King's Peak, Aconcagua, and Camden Hills " operated by BP, TotalFinaElf, and Marathon Oil, respectively. Water depth along the 56-mile route varies from 300 to 7,200 feet.The umbilical and control system is comprised of the following subsystems:Surface equipment including the Master Control Station (MCS), Electrical Power Unit (EPU), Uninterruptible Power Supply (UPS), Hydraulic Power Unit (HPU), methanol and chemical injection pump skids, Topside Umbilical Termination Box (TUTB), and associated tubing, cabling and appurtenances. Subsea control pods mounted on each subsea tree and associated instrumentation. Network of twelve main and infield electro-hydraulic steel tube umbilicals, varying in length from 0.4 to 41 miles in length, complete with subsea umbilical terminations

AB  - AbstractSix hydraulic-fracture injections into a fluvial sandstone at a depth of 4500 ft were monitored with multi-level triaxial seismic receivers in two wells, resulting in maps of the growth and final geometry of each fracture based upon microseismic activity. These diagnostic images show that the hydraulic fractures are highly contained for smaller-volume KCl-water injections, but height growth is significant for the larger-volume, higher-rate, higher-viscosity treatments. Fracture lengths for most injections are similar. Final results are also compared with fracture models.IntroductionThe imaging of hydraulic fractures at depth has been a long-sought goal of the petroleum industry. Fracturing is an expensive, yet essential, element of production for many gas reservoirs and has significantly improved economics for many oil reservoirs as well. The Gas Research Institute and the US Department of Energy have long funded diagnostics programs and have achieved a slow but steady progress toward the realization of such technology. Fracture imaging is now attainable due to the improved capabilities of advanced receiver technology, advanced telemetry, and portable high-power computing. It is only characteristics of the reservoir and the well configurations which limit the potential of the technique. This paper describes the results of a series of fracturing experiments in a single reservoir interval that demonstrates the capabilities of this technology and its value to related issues of modeling and fundamental model mechanisms.BackgroundFracture diagnostics have a long history that includes production history matching, post-frac well testing, radioactive tracers, temperature logs, pressure decline analysis, treatment pressure analysis and modeling, surface tiltmeters, surface electromagnetic techniques, and various seismic techniques. All of these diagnostics are indirect, in the sense that they measure some parameter associated with the hydraulic fracture and infer fracture characteristics from the parameter or its changes. As with most indirect techniques, problems with uniqueness and inversion abound.One of these techniques is different, however; and is capable of producing a highly accurate image of the fracture without the processing difficulties inherent in inversion problems. The microseismic method, one of several seismic technologies, is an indirect technique in that it monitors small faults or slippages that occur in the vicinity of the fracture (rather than the fracture itself), but is fully capable of producing an image of these microearthquakes. With proper interpretation models for the reservoir under consideration, the relation of the microseisms to the fracture can be clearly established. More importantly, for reservoirs with highly compressible fluids (e.g., gas reservoirs), the envelope of microseisms is approximately the same as the fracture size, with the exception of the width. Thus the microseismic method can produce relatively accurate images of the fracture length, height, and azimuth.The microseismic technique is the primary diagnostic method employed to monitor fractures at the M-Site. It builds upon a technology proven in several elaborate field experiments, but with a focus of developing a viable, wireline-run, fracture-diagnostic service. As such, validation is an essential element of building confidence in this technology, and the M-Site experiments have been designed to provide that validation, particularly through the application of downhole inclinometers and intersecting wells.P. 327

AB  - AbstractThis paper addresses the basic configuration of simple subsea completions. In an attempt to present an overview of the options open to an operator, examples are taken from various systems which have been designed and/or installed. Features from more advanced designs have become available to upgrade the state of the art in this field. It should be emphasized that like land and platform wellheads and trees, a vast array of options and customized designs are available to meet particular requirements in this environment, and it is difficult to propose particular requirements in this environment, and it is difficult to propose a standard completion. To enable a concise view of a subsea completion all major areas have been touched, from the drilling equipment required, the interface equipment and finally the tree and control systems typically available. WELLHEADS Wellheads for offshore wells fall into three main categories. 1. Marine Wellheads for Floating drilling units. 2. Mudline Suspension/Surface Wellhead for `fixed bottom' Jackup units. 3. A Hybrid System of 1 and 2 generally a special purpose design for specific applications. MARINE WELLHEADS (See Figure 1) This type of wellhead is located on the ocean floor level. Its primary functions are: 1. To provide a termination of the casing strings with a means to connect the primary well pressure control equipment. 2. Provide a means of guidance for the Blowout Preventor stack, and guidance of any additional equipment such as a subsea tree (if required). 3. Provide a means of suspending the various casing strings and sealing the annuli. The footing rig used to drill the well is equipped with a subsea Blowout Preventor stack (BOP).

AB  - ABSTRACT Traditionally any re-entry of a subsea completion for downhole maintenance or data gathering has involved the use of a semi-submersible drilling rig or Through Flow Line (TFL) techniques. The drilling rig is slow to mobilise and is generally over equipped for the task, reducing its cost effectiveness. The TFL option increases the complexity of the well, requires a high initial capital outlay and is unsuitable for production logging.This paper describes a subsea wireline system which can be deployed from a dynamically positioned monohull vessel providing a low cost, flexible alternative. This system has been used in an extensive wireline and production logging operation in the UK northern North Sea, demonstrating its versatility and its potential for providing a fast response with major cost savings.INTRODUCTION There are currently some 400 subsea completions worldwide and with the trend towards subsea production systems, particularly for marginal field developments, this number is predicted to increase significantly over the next decade.The use of a drilling rig with a conventional BOP stack and a tensioned tie-back riser has a number of significant drawbacks when used for well servicing. Transit speeds are slow, anchor handling operations are time consuming and support vessels are required. Hence the overall cost is high and has precluded all but the essential work required to maintain production. Consequently the procurement of reservoir data has generally not been attempted unless it could be combined with infrequent mechanical work on the well. Permanent downhole gauges have been used, however their long term reliability is unproven and the resultant data has been limited to pressure and temperature measurements at a single depth.The expansion in subsea developments has created a need for a cost effective, self contained, well service system which can be rapidly mobilised to carry out a wide range of well intervention tasks.The subsea wireline lubricator system was developed to meet this need and allows a complete range of slick line and electric line downhole operations to be carried out on subsea wells from relatively smaller dynamically positioned vessels. In fact the development of a subsea wireline system has been ongoing for nearly 20 years. In 1970 joint trials were carried out by BP, ADMA and CFP (Totan, using a Flopetrol designed Subsea Wireline Lubricator (SWL), which was deployed on a subsea well in the Zakum field, offshore Abu Dhabi, in 65 ft of water.It was not until 1984 that a SWL was deployed commercially in the much harsher environment of the North Sea. This SWL was developed by BP, using some of the Flopetrol components, to service the subsea wells on the template beneath the Buchan Alpha moored semi-submersible production platform. The Buchan field is located in a water depth of 375ft, in the UK central North Sea. Following successful wireline operations on the template wells in the field in 1985, a project was initiated with a wireline company (Camco) and a vessel operator (Stena) to develop a handling system to enable the Buchan SWL to be deployed on satellite wells from a dynamically positioned Diving Support Vessel (DSV).

AB  - ABSTRACTOffshore pipelines are typically laid on the seabed and lowered into the seabed (trenched) over large sections to provide protection from shipping and fishing activities, or to stabilise the pipeline from hydrodynamic loads. Accurate estimates of the resistance to upward pipeline movement of the overlying clayey trench-backfill are important for design and analytical purposes. The undrained shear strength (cu) of the upper layers of the seabed (particularly the initial 2 to 3 m below the mudline) is therefore a vital part of pipeline site investigations and is commonly found using the cone penetrometer (CPT). The limitations of standard CPTs may be overcome with the use of novel shaped penetrometers. The measured resistance can be easily used to calculate undrained shear strength using an unique bearing capacity or ‘bar’ factor. This paper describes the application of standard in situ cone penetrometer and T-bar tests from an ROV for the determination of undrained shear strength parameters for pipeline buried in deltaic soft clay. Comparisons with in situ plate bearing tests are also provided and the advantages of this novel form of in situ test are discussed.INTRODUCTIONOffshore pipelines are typically laid on the seabed and lowered into the seabed (trenched) over large sections to provide protection from shipping and fishing activities, to stabilise the pipeline from hydrodynamic loads or for thermal stability. Since pipeline rupture can potentially cause permanent or long-term environmental damage, the risk of exposure of the pipeline due to upheaval buckling, wave-induced liquefaction or erosion must be carefully assessed. Particularly at risk from upheaval buckling failures are pipelines in very soft clays, which are found towards the margins of estuaries and deltas. These may also contain fine sandy or silty laminations, and are commonly highly plastic.

AB  - Monitoring of time-varying reservoir properties, such as the state of stress, is a primary goal of geophysical investigations, including for geological sequestration of CO2, enhanced hydrocarbon recovery (EOR), and other subsurface engineering activities. In this work, we used Continuous Active-Source Seismic Monitoring (CASSM), with cross-well geometry, to measure variation in seismic coda amplitude, as a consequence of effective stress change (in the form of changes in pore fluid pressure). To our knowledge, the presented results are the first in-situ example of such crosswell measurement at reservoir scale and in field conditions. Data compliment the findings of our previous work which investigated the relationship between pore fluid pressure and seismic velocity (velocity-stress sensitivity) using the CASSM system at the same field site (Marchesini et al., 2017, in review). We find that P-wave coda amplitude decreases with decreasing pore pressure (increasing effective stress).

AB  - SPE Members AbstractPredictions and workover findings revealed that sulphate and carbonate scale problems have a significant impact on the Glamis field production. Scale predictions closely agreed with the findings. An estimation of the rate factors governing the kinetics of calcium carbonate have been made. Specific treatment facilities, permitting downhole injection and inhibitor squeezing were incorporated into the designs of the recompleted satellite wells to combat the two scaling mechanisms. IntroductionThe Glamis Field is a subsea satellite development tied back to the Balmoral Floating Production Vessel, 7 km away - See Figure 1. The Field was completed with one seawater injection well and two production wells, both of which were sidetracked in 1993 to maintain field production. Scaling in the production wells is a significant issue because: Their remoteness would make mechanical removal of any scale expensive. The high barium and strontium levels in the formation water will result in a high sulphate scaling tendency when mixed with injection water, and Carbonate scaling potentials become high with increasing water cut and lower well pressures. The discussion below shows how the scaling problem was detected and evaluated and what measures have been used to control scaling in the future. 16/21a-6 WELL HISTORY The well was drilled as an exploration well in 1982 to the Glamis Jurassic structure. In June 1989, the well was completed with a 41/2" 13% chrome completion string and was brought on stream in August 1989 at an initial rate of 4500 STBPD dry oil. Due to the proximity of the oil water contact, water production began almost immediately (Figure 2) and had steadily risen to 65% watercut by April 1992. The well failed to come back on line after a 4 day platform shutdown in April 1992. Several unsuccessful attempts were made to encourage the well to flow by reducing the riser hydrostatic head (including displacement to diesel, nitrogen lifting and gas lifting). P. 125^

AB  - 1. SUMMARY The purpose of acid treatments fall into two basic categories: Matrix Acidizing and Fracturing Acidizing. In Matrix acidizing the acid flow is confined to the formation's natural pores and flow channels at bottom hole pressure less than fracturing pressure. The purpose is to increase the pressure. The purpose is to increase the permeability and porosity of the producing permeability and porosity of the producing formation. In Fracture Acidizing the acid is injected through natural or induced formation fractures at pressure usually exceeding the fracture pressure of the formation. This type of stimulation enlarges or creates flow channels from the formation to the well bore. In both types of acidizing, effective stimulation depends upon permeating the producing formation with an extensive network of channels, to enable hydrocarbon to flow from the reservoir rock to the well bore. A review is made hereafter, to assess various methods as applied to stimulate complex, multilayered carbonates, in the Upper Zakum field, Offshore Abu Dhabi in the U.A.E. The review also include a resume of a mini-frac, that was carried out to gather fracturing parameters under in-situ conditions, the objective parameters under in-situ conditions, the objective being to investigate the possibility of creating a contained fracture without creating communicating between the adjacent Thamama horizons. Conclusions suggest that good primary cementing is essential to effective stimulation of multilayered reservoirs. Further work is needed on the feasibility of achieving good cement bond along thin 0.6-1.8m (2-6ft) of interbeds. 2. INTRODUCTION : The Upper Zakum designates the three uppermost Thamama reservoirs (Thamama I, II and III) of the Zakum field, one of the largest offshore fields in the Arabian Gulf. The field is centered about 80 kms (50 miles) North-West of the island of Abu Dhabi. The field covers an area of 1217 square kilometers (470 sq. miles) and lies under an average water depth of 18.3m (60 ft). As can be seen in Fig. 1. Thamama I and II are considered as unit reservoirs, while Thamama III is divided into subreservoirs according to dense (dolometic) interbeds separating them. The field development plan relies on a pressure maintenance scheme using filtered sea water. Two schemes are used, five-spot pattern and peripheral water injection. The first was adopted for Thamama I and II reservoirs and the latter for Thamama III reservoirs. Commingling was prohibited to ensure optimum recovery in producers and maximum sweep efficiency. All the wells are completed on dual basis with Thamama IA and II completed together, since they rely on the same pressure maintenance scheme (five-spot), while multiple dual completion combinations for Thamama III sub-reservoirs is adopted. MATRIX STIMULATION METHODS A. Stimulation by Diverting Technique Thamama III subreservoirs are isolated with relatively thick (15-30 ft.) dense layers, which help in completing each subzone separately. While Thamama II is characterized by its 6 sublayers with different porosities and permeabilities, the sublayers are normally isolated through thin 0.6-1.8 m (2-6 ft.) stylolitic interbeds.

AB  - During the production phase of the PW1 well, an unintentional operation depressurized the annulus A below its design limit, causing a progressive casing collapse from the surface casing to the tubing string, resulting in a well failure and a subsequent an abandonment operation. This event was detailed in a previous publication (Campos et al., 2019). After a detailed investigation of the events that drove the well failure and using casing design software to simulate the well behavior with the historical time series data, it was possible to identify the exact moment of the casings collapse through mathematical modelling. Based on that, considering innovation as critical success factor (Rocha, 2012), PETROBRAS started an R&D project to evaluate, in real time, critical integrity events during production phase. The approach proposed consists on the integration of a transient fluid flow model (Bonizzi, 2003) and (Bonizzi, Andreussi and Banerjee, 2009) with a structural model (Araújo et al., 2019) of the well and loads being calculated in real time as a function of the production data (PDG’s, X-TREE and Topside). The process described was named as Well Integrity Surveillance (WIS) and its being designed to work 24/7 in a collaborative environment, integrating well handover information, inspections and intervention reports, production data and flow modeling. The objective of this paper is to present the well integrity case study of a deep-water field in the Brazilian coast, through a real time digital twin approach, highlighting the main technological solutions, developed to ensure the assets operational envelope, during its lifetime. With the well integrity surveillance digital twin, PETROBRAS successfully implemented a pilot project on three offshore production units in Brazil, increasing the knowledge of the well structural behavior and consequentially the assets operational safety during its lifetime.

AB  - ABSTRACTOvertopping of water waves over the crest of vertical and sloping coastal structures is simulated with large-eddy simulation (LES) in this paper. The computations are conducted in a numerical wave tank, based on our recently developed solver. It involves a time-implicit cell-staggered approximately-factored volume-offluid (VOF) finite volume (FV) approach on a nonuniform Cartesian cut-cell grid. Additionally, the Godunov-type high-order upwind schemes are introduced for discretization of the convective fluxes, while the coupling of the pressure with the velocity is realized by a projection method. A static Smagorinsky model and dynamic one are used for description of the subgrid-scale (SGS) stress. The surface tension effects are considered as a body force according to the continuous surface force manner. When flows are driven by a wave generator located at the inlet, the results for regular and irregular waves indicate that the LES technique predicts most of the significant features of the breaking waves during overtopping process. By comparison, computations agree well with measurements available under grid refinements. INTRODUCTIONOvertopping of waves over vertical and sloping coastal structures is always accompanied by breaking waves. Its significant feature is the rapid deformation of a free-surface. In particular, flows become highly turbulent. An adequate turbulence model, therefore, is required for problems related to the simulation of the breakwater. This can be observed in Fig. 1 with one example for wave overtopping over the sea dike at a certain time, where the energy of waves accumulated at high wavenumbers needs to be dissipated by turbulence, because the waves continuously break in the surf zone. (figure 1 shown in paper) In LES, flows are decomposed into the large-scale eddies and the small-scale ones, respectively, by applying a low-pass filter to the Navier-Stokes (NS) equations.

AB  - ABSTRACT The Balmoral development constituted one of the largest subsea facilities at its time of commissioning in 1986 and included a purpose built floating production vessel (FPV). Experience gained over seven years in the operation of pipelines, risers, subsea controls, downhole pressure monitoring systems and other equipment are presented in this paper. INTRODUCTION The Balmoral field (Block 16/21) is located in the UK sector of the North Sea, some 140 miles NE of Aberdeen in a water depth of 145 metres. The field was discovered in 1975 and development drilling began in 1984 with production commencing in November 1986. The Balmoral facilities (fig 1) comprise the world's first purpose built floating production vessel (FPV) moored over a large subsea template accommodating ten subsea production wells, three manifolds and major components of the electrohydraulic control system. The FPV and template are connected by a system of flexible risers and a dynamic riser control umbilical.Ten template productions and nine satellite wells (three production, six water injection) tied back to the template were included in the initial project. At the time of commissioning, Balmoral was one of the largest subsea complexes in the North sea. Since then, three further Sun operated satellite developments have been linked into the Balmoral facilities Glamis (1989), Blair (1989) and Stirling (1993). Although Blair is now abandoned, the complex as a whole has included seventeen production and seven water injection wells. The inbuilt flexibility in the original Balmoral topside and subsea facilities has enabled these other fields to be included with relative ease and potential still exists for future tie-ins. In seven years of operation, Sun has gained invaluable experience in operating a floating/subsea complex, some of which have been detailed previously (ref 1-7).The Balmoral reservoir located approximately 7000 R below sea level was initially judged to have a STO11P of between 187 and 299 MMSTB of which 67 million were recoverable. These figures were based on the results of appraisal drilling and a 2-Dimensional seismic survey. By 1992, it was apparent that the reservoir was over performing and a reservoir simulation model indicated a revised STO11P of Up to 2S6 MMSTB with recoverable barrels of 100 million.In 1992, a 3-Dimensional seismic survey was conducted and the exercise has confirmed the recoverables at the revised figure of 100 million, but reduced the potential variation of STO11P to between 173 and 210 MMSTB.Recoverable reserves were raised by over 30% with the accuracy much improved so allowing better technical and financial assessment of field life and potential for future in-till wells.The Glamis field, located approximately 7 km south east of Balmoral, has proved to be a source of additional production and revenue. Coming on stream in 1989, this Jurassic accumulation was estimated to possess 17 MMSTB, since revised upwards to 21 MMSTB. An additional benefit is that the high GOR (1037 scf/stb) of the crude provided gas for the gas lifting of Balmoral wells which were experiencing decline in flow rate due to increased water cuts.

AB  - Numerical simulations of focused wave interactions with a fixed floating production storage and offloading (FPSO)-like structure are presented, representing an individual contribution to the CCP-WSI Blind Test Series 1, in which they are compared against both physical and alternative numerical solutions. The model is based in OpenFOAM with wave generation achieved via linear superposition of first-order wave components, derived from the empty tank data. This work focuses on comparing the “blind” estimation of accuracy, based on reproduction of the physical empty tank data (released before submission to the blind test), with the observed error in wave runup and pressure on the bow of the structure (following the release of the complete physical data set). The results imply that achieving a good reproduction of surface elevation based on the empty tank data does not necessarily correlate with good agreement when a structure is present. INTRODUCTION Two key issues limiting the routine use of high-fidelity models, such as computational fluid dynamics (CFD), are the uncertainty in the accuracy and the required time to obtain the numerical results. For the industry to benefit from the strengths of these methods, there is a need for a parametric understanding of their predictive capability and a reduction in the time taken to produce useable results. The required time to set up CFD simulations is a factor, often overlooked, that is sometimes significant in the overall time required to get a result. If a parametric understanding of the accuracy were achieved, the implementation time could be reduced greatly through increased confidence in prediction when using standardised, best practice implementations.

AB  - SummarySix hydraulic-fracture injections into a fluvial sandstone at a depth of 4,500 ft were monitored with multilevel, triaxial, seismic receivers in two wells, resulting in maps of the growth and final geometry of each fracture based upon microseismic activity. These diagnostic images show that the hydraulic fractures are highly contained for smaller-volume KCl-water injections, but height growth is significant for the larger-volume, higher-rate, higher-viscosity treatments. Fracture lengths for most injections are similar regardless of volume and fluid type.IntroductionThe imaging of hydraulic fractures at depth has been a long-sought goal of the petroleum industry. Fracturing is an expensive, yet essential, element of production for many gas reservoirs and has significantly improved economics for many oil reservoirs as well. The Gas Research Institute and the US Department of Energy have long funded diagnostics programs and have achieved slow but steady progress toward the realization of such technology. Fracture imaging is now attainable due to the improved capabilities of advanced receiver technology, advanced telemetry, and portable high-power computing. It is only characteristics of the reservoir and the well configurations which limit the potential of the technique. This paper describes the results of a series of fracturing experiments in a single reservoir interval that demonstrates the capabilities of this technology and its value to related issues of modeling and fundamental model mechanisms. Background Fracture diagnostics have a long history that includes production history matching, postfrac well testing, radioactive tracers, temperature logs, pressure decline analysis, treatment pressure analysis and modeling, surface tiltmeters, surface electromagnetic techniques, and various seismic techniques. Most of these diagnostics are indirect, in the sense that they measure some parameter associated with the hydraulic fracture and infer fracture characteristics from the parameter or its changes. As with most indirect techniques, the inversion process can introduce large uncertainties. One of these techniques is different, however, and is capable of producing a highly accurate image of the fracture without the processing difficulties inherent in inversion problems. The microseismic method,1-6 one of several seismic technologies, is an indirect technique in that it maps the locations of microseisms (small shear slippages on natural fractures, bedding planes or other weak features) occurring in the vicinity of the fracture (rather than the fracture itself). However, these microseisms can be accurately located and they do not require any inversion algorithms that suffer from uniqueness and resolution questions. With a proper understanding of the microseismic activity expected for the reservoir under consideration, the relationship of the microseisms to the fracture can generally be clearly established. For example, in reservoirs with highly compressible fluids (e.g., gas reservoirs), the envelope of microseisms approximates the fracture dimensions, with the exception of the width. Thus the microseismic method can produce relatively accurate images of the fracture length, height, and azimuth. The microseismic technique is the primary diagnostic method employed to map hydraulic fracture geometry at the M-Site — the focus of this paper. Microseismic imaging technology, conducted in several elaborate field experiments,1,7-10 has evolved to the point where a wireline-run, fracture-imaging service is practical. In the process of conducting these field experiments, verification that the imaged fracture geometry closely approximates the actual fracture geometry has been an essential objective to build confidence in this technology. The M-Site experiments have been designed to provide that validation, particularly through the application of downhole inclinometers and intersecting wells used as independent techniques to confirm fracture geometry. In addition to improving fracture diagnostics, a secondary goal of the M-Site experiments has been to improve and validate fracture models and to better understand fracture-growth mechanisms. This goal was accomplished by performing tests in a reservoir with measured properties, fully monitoring the fracture treatments, obtaining time-imaged fracture geometries, comparing the diagnostic results with various models, and using specialized fracture monitoring technology (i.e., an intersecting well) to provide previously unavailable information. M-Site In depth details of the M-Site layout and fracture treatments are given by Peterson et al.11 and are only briefly repeated here. The M-Site field experiments, located at the previous Multiwell Experiment site in the Piceance basin of Colorado, are co-funded by the Gas Research Institute (GRI) and the US Department of Energy. The reservoirs undergoing testing are fluvial Mesaverde sand-shale sequences, so the technologies developed in this difficult environment are easily translatable to many other reservoirs throughout the world. Details of previous work can be found in several papers and reports.9-12A schematic of the well, instrument, and sandstone-reservoir layout are shown in Fig. 1. The site consists of one treatment well (MWX-2), one monitor well with cemented-in triaxial seismic receivers and biaxial inclinometers, and one cased observation well for wireline run tools (MWX-3). Not shown in the figure are deviated lateral intersection wells that penetrate through the created hydraulic fractures in each sandstone.

AB  - Abstract TOTAL E&P Indonésie (TEPI) is the biggest gas producer in Indonesia, who also produces oil. At the time this paper is written, TEPI is operating six Production Sites, two Logistic Bases, seven Drilling Rigs, hundreds of Floating Vessels and thousands of Oil & Gas wells. Central Processing Area (CPA) is a site that produces oil with some free gas from 555 deltaic multilayer sand reservoirs of Handil field. The site was built 40 years ago with its peak production around 200,000 BPD of oil in 1977. Today CPA produces on average 16,000 B/D of oil and 30 MMsfcd of gas. From total 694 well strings, only about 20% of it is actively flowing; these well strings are spread over 65 clusters. Most of the oil wells are artificially lifted by pump or gas lift compressors. Facilities were added and adapted along with the needs, such as High and Low Pressure gas compressors and Gas Lift Compression unit. Several Enhanced Oil Recovery (EOR) projects had been tried, such as gas injection, air injection, and water injection. Currently the only artificial lift remaining is gas lift, and the EOR remain is water injection; the rests are stopped and modified. Nowadays, the main challenges of this mature field are integrity and HSE. Old design, obsolescence, modification of existing facility, and integrating with new technology generates several risks. Along with the maturity, leaks and potential leaks increase over time. The issues are corrosion, surface cracks, seepages, fugitive emission, obsolete equipment, increasing sand production, etc. Furthermore, several disused equipment also become another threat. This paper will discuss how CPA, a 40 years old Oil & Gas Production Installation, manages its Integrity and HSE. It will explain the challenges, good initiatives, and room for improvements. The topics will include Risk assessment & Identification, Inspection strategy, Integrity, Maintenance, Preservations, Work Permit implementation, Emergency exercise, etc.

AB  - Abstract A large Middle Eastern oil field, located in Arabian Gulf, is producing a 28° API oil from heterogeneous Upper Mishrif Cenomanian carbonates. The mature field is experiencing high water-cuts arising from a complex combination of different water production mechanisms. Despite the high water production, remaining stakes have been identified and will be targeted for future development. The aim was to build a new reservoir model to be used as an evaluation tool for future field redevelopment. Successful field history matching required the combination of four water production mechanisms at field and local scale: natural depletion of tighter interbedded layers, water-drive, small-scale dual medium effects and large scale conductive natural fractures. The major problem was that from the outset, matches were found with different relative contributions of these mechanisms and possibly with less than four mechanisms modelled. In this challenging context, an innovative history matching workflow has specifically been developed and implemented in order to match the full field behaviour.  In outline, the work started with a conventional simulation model which is sufficient to handle the material balance of the system, the natural depletion and the water-drive mechanisms. Complexity was then increased by adding small scale dual-medium effects or explicit large scale conductive features using dual porosity – dual permeability modeling to create two separate models. Finally combination of these two models together gives a full field model which captures all the water production mechanisms. This approach has had two main advantages. It allows (1) a progressive understanding of water production mechanisms and their varying contribution towards water cuts across the field and (2) an optimization of running times of individual simulations as the bulk of the pressure matching work, troubleshooting and broad stroke matching were carried out on computationally inexpensive models. The workflow has also allowed an important parallelization of the matching work using several reservoir engineers working on different models.  Finally, a successful history match has been achieved and the final model is currently being used to evaluate future development options. Introduction An oil field, located offshore in Arabian Gulf, has been producing since the late 90s from the complex Upper Mishrif Cenomanian carbonates. The maximum oil column thickness is about 80m from top structure to Free Water Level (FWL) and most of the oil in place lies in the transition zone. Because of reservoir heterogeneity and complexity, the field is still being developed using a phased approach. In addition to the main development phases, infill well drilling has been continuous to maximise production and reduce uncertainties. Since the start of the development, the field has experienced a rapid increase in water cut, passing from 10% to close to 90% in less than 15 years. This water cut evolution results from different reservoir heterogeneities which have impacted more or less across the field: main features evidenced to date result from diagenetic imprints (dissolution, karstification and cementation) as well as structural elements (fracture corridors). The current study was launched to build a new history matched reservoir model, integrating the most recent wells results, with the aim of being one of the tools to be used for the evaluation of future development possibilities over the field. The innovative and pragmatic workflow used to build the model has proved successful for the history matching of this complex field and could provide a useful template for other studies of multi-component carbonate fields.

AB  - Abstract Qatargas North Field wells are typically 7 inch monobore medium to high deviation wells and are designed to handle high pressure sour gas containing of H2S and CO2. An extensive rigless well intervention program is carried out with 0.23 inch electric line and with 0.125 inch slickline for data acquisition, and for other downhole wireline jobs. During a rigless PLT operation with 0.23 inch e-line, an accidental closure of the TRSCSSV resulted in cutting of the e-line. This necessitated a rigless heavy duty wireline intervention resulting in a successful, safe and a cost effective fishing operation in recovering 11,414 ft of 0.23 inch braided e-line. This paper describes the approach and the technique applied in the fishing operation considering the limitations of a rigless operation. It also outlines the extensive workshop trials carried out during the preparatory phase for developing an acceptable double block and bleed barrier arrangement on the PCE for a safe well intervention. It also describes the planning considerations, the procedures developed, the high level Risk Assessment carried out, and the elaborate Load Assessment Study for working with a 90 ft mast and 0.23 inch braided line on a remote un-manned offshore platform. Introduction: Qatargas North Field is located offshore, northeast of Qatar in the Arabian Gulf and is the world's largest non-associated gas field. The sour, slightly over-pressured natural gas is contained in the Khuff carbonate formation. Majority of the offshore wells are 7 inch monobore design completed with 7 inch CRA tubing and liner sections. Wells deviations range from vertical to about 70 degrees. An extensive rigless e-line program is carried out for data acquisition. This comprises of baseline logging program carried out just after PST, followed by a surveillance logging program carried out at a specified interval to study the changes in the reservoir, production and well parameters. The logging program generally comprises of production logging & pressure build-up (PLT-PBU), reservoir saturation survey (RST), and electromagnetic imaging survey (EMIT) and PS Platform Multifinger Imaging Survey (PMIT). The surveys are conducted in shut-in condition as well as in flowing condition at different rates. A drift run is generally conducted prior to any of these intervention jobs to ensure there is no obstruction inside the tubing or casing. A 70 ft mast is used to rig up the required lengths of lubricators and the Pressure Control equipment. The wells are vertically equipped with a manual Swab Valve (SV), a hydraulically controlled Upper Master Valve (UMV), and a manual Lower Master Valve (LMV). A big bore tubing retrievable surface controlled sub-surface safety valve (TRSCSSV) is a part of the completion. During the well intervention jobs, the hydraulic controls for TRSCSSV and UMV are switched over to a Wireline Panel. This Panel has two remote Emergency Shut Down (ESD) system located at two strategic places to close TRSCSSV and UMV in case of exigency, when approach to the Wireline Panel is not possible.

AB  - Abstract Although pore pressure is difficult to measure in low permeability rocks such as shale, it nevertheless has an enormous impact on drilling, hydrocarbon production and geomechanics applications such as hydraulic fracturing and wellbore stability analysis. Pore pressure is, thus, a key parameter for economic development of unconventional reservoirs, for which a predrill pore-pressure estimate is essential. In such reservoirs, changes in lithology occur over vertical depth intervals too small to be resolved using seismic velocities derived by means of normal moveout (NMO) analysis or kinematic inversion because these velocities typically have poor vertical resolution. By comparison, inversion of reflection amplitudes yields higher vertical resolution and greater sensitivity to reservoir properties, due to the influence of density in addition to that of velocity. We present an approach for predicting pore pressure based on P-impedance and the ratio VP / VS of the vertical P-velocity, VP, to vertical S-velocity, VS, obtained from inversion of seismic amplitude variation with offset (AVO) data. Employing P-impedance is analogous to using seismic velocity in conventional seismic-based pore-pressure prediction. However P-impedance from AVO inversion has higher vertical resolution and greater sensitivity than velocities from kinematics. Use of VP / VS allows partial compensation for the influence of variable lithology and mineralogy on Pimpedance.

AB  - Abstract Control system failures in subsea operations are a leading cause of Blowout Preventer (BOP) down-time. The cost of these failures can increase exponentially with water depth. Legacy BOP control systems are based on 90-year-old hydraulics technology and have been stretched to cope with new regulatory requirements and harsher environments. The industry has responded to these design requirements by increasing component sizes, weights, and system complexities. These adaptations have resulted in unintended consequences, such as reduced reliability and an increase in wellhead loading. As subsea operations move into deeper water and wellhead pressures increase above 15,000 psi, legacy control systems may have reached their design limit. This paper introduces a new concept of an all-electric BOP, a game-changing technology that will not only negate these issues, but also improve the safety, efficiency, reliability, and functionality of subsea BOP control systems.

AB  - Abstract It is well accepted by the Oil and Gas industry that approximately 30%-40% of perforations or perforation clusters do not contribute to the production of a multi-stage fracturing stimulated well. Diversion is a common method to maximize the wellbore coverage. The objective of this study is to evaluate and maximize the effect of diversion in multi-cluster horizontal well hydraulic fracturing applications using water hammer profile analysis, step down test and microseismic monitoring. In this study, the authors demonstrated integrated approach for the well stimulation efficiency evaluation. A number of methods have been used for analysis: First, step-down tests after each stage have been used to estimate perforations accepting fluid. Second, innovative method of the high frequency surface pressure record analysis was used to detect diversion. Additionally, microseismic monitoring was used as an independent measurement that allows to validate the results. Eight wells were hydraulically fractured with multiple clusters per stage. Each stage is separated either by frac baffles or plugs. Diverter was pumped to promote more uniform wellbore stimulation. Shut- in procedure was implemented after each diverter step. Signatures of water hammer during shut-in are recorded by high frequency pressure gauge and analyzed in real-time using advanced algorithm from speech processing domain. Locations of clusters receiving fluid were calculated and diversion results are qualified. Microseismic measurements in some of the evaluated wells and step down tests are also performed to qualify the diversion process. All of these measurements were done in real-time and utilized to maximize the number of frac propagations, which will have a positive impact on production. This engineering technique allows the operator to make informed real-time decision based on the effectiveness of inter-stage isolation and diversion. Small footprint high frequency pressure monitoring (HFPM) allows the optimization of cost/BOE ratio.

AB  - ABSTRACT Large-eddy simulations (LES''s)? for free-surface turbulent flows are conducted by solving the three-dimensional (3D) spatialfiltered Navier-Stokes (NS) equations with the Galerkin-weighted residual minimization. The turbulent closure is based on the Renormalization Group (RNG) theory. The solution procedure employs a projection method that uncouples the pressure from the velocity through enforcement of mass conservation. Fully nonlinear free-surface boundary conditions (BC''s) are adopted. The complex processes of boundary layer separations, vortex shedding and turbulence transition beneath the free surface, particularly the wake-wave interactions are investigated. Calibration is made by a uniform flow past a vertical circular cylinder. The computed results correlate fairly well with the available experimental data in the time-averaged sense and indicate that the presence of a free-surface reduces the von Karman instability locally near the free surface. Presumably, this is because the flow instability associated with large-scale flow structures and induced by small-scale ones decreases under such a free-moving boundary, and the kinetic energy is partially transferred to the potential energy in order to follow the wave motion. This inference is further sustained by the variations of the computed hydrodynamic forces on rigid body surfaces. INTRODUCTION In marine engineering, the presence of a free surface, which is usually pierced by bluff bodies, makes the wake structure very complicated. With the surface tension and viscous traction at the free surface, the transformation between potential and kinetic energies severely influences the turbulence transition, causes interaction between the wake and wave, and consequently, modifies the drag and lift forces acting on the bodies. In modeling the viscous free-surface flow, one encounters the difficulty arising from the coexistence of viscous and gravity forces, which causes the problem difficult to be totally scale independent. The resultant full-scale requirement dramatically increases the expense for physical experiments or even makes them impractical.

AB  - This article, written by Technology Editor Dennis Denney, contains highlights of paper OTC 18613, "An Alternative Approach to Wellhead Flowline-Pressure Protection," by Angela E. Summers and Bryan Zachary, SIS-Tech Solutions, prepared for the 2007 Offshore Technology Conference, Houston, 30 April-3 May. For many years, pipe-specification standards have required that piping downstream of the wellhead be adequate to sustain a full wellhead shut-in. This inherently safe design practice ensured that the flowline pipe was specified with a maximum allowable working pressure (MAWP) equal to or greater than the maximum pressure expected to be produced by the well. This practice has proved to provide adequate protection in thousands of wellhead installations throughout the world. Inherently safe practice has been challenged when retrofitting electrical submersible pumps (ESPs). In such cases, the maximum discharge pressure under block-in conditions is greater than the MAWP of existing flowline pipe. A safe alternative to replacing the pipe is the use of a high-integrity protective system (HIPS) designed and managed as a safety-instrumented system (SIS) with a Safety Integrity Level (SIL) of 3. Introduction When the price of crude oil rose above USD 50/bbl, oil-producing companies pursued efforts to increase or renew production in existing oil wells. One solution, especially in ultradeep (4,000-ft water depth) subsea applications, is to boost well pressure. A major challenge in developing these deepwater solutions is the MAWP limitation of the downstream flowline pipe. An HIPS can close block valves placed in front of the low-specification pipe, protecting the lower-rated downstream piping. The introduction of high-pressure ESPs in many offshore fields has increased the maximum shut-in pressure beyond the MAWP of the downstream flowline pipe. The design of the instrumented-system response is complicated by the need to respond quickly. Upon shut-in, the ESP can produce pressure sufficient to challenge the mechanical integrity of the flowline very quickly. The pressure rise is related to the compressibility of the material, but the pressure rise generally is rapid, resulting in a very-short process safety time (e.g., in liquid service, the time may be less than 5 seconds). In typical onshore process-industry applications, an overpressure hazard such as that encountered by the ESP-well flowline would be addressed by a pressure-relief device (PRD) and a disposal system, such as a flare or scrubber to safely process the material relieved during an overpressure event. When PRDs are installed in conventional flowline designs, they typically are sized to mitigate only thermal expansion of the material when the flowline is blocked-in. For HIPS flowline designs, the PRD sizing also should consider possible block-valve leakage. A safe and reliable alternative to replacing the existing wellhead flowlines relies on the use of an HIPS to detect unacceptable operating pressure and initiate closure of block valves. An HIPS is a special class of SIS.

AB  - SummaryThe usual approach to the interpretation of producing wells is based on mechanistic models for the simulation of steady-state and transient flow regimes. However, there are significant reservations about convergence problems, computational limits, the need for extensive tuning on field data, the instability of boundary conditions, the limited applicability of existing multiphase flow models, and the uncertainties associated with choke-valve models. The current industry standards are critically reviewed within this framework.The real-time monitoring of producing wells is recognized as the best way of optimizing field performance. Monitoring a producing well implies the ability to track any changes in fluid composition, flow rates, or pressure and temperature profiles in real time. Multiphase flowmetering (MFM) plays a key role in this scenario. Such information, combined with the critical analysis of historical data from the well itself or from analog wells, allows diagnosis of the system and prediction of future trends. However, field data per se do not necessarily generate knowledge. This is particularly true for large databases, which are difficult to manipulate to provide suitable inputs for wellbore simulators.This paper suggests how MFM, knowledge discovery in databases (KDD), and fuzzy logic (FL) can offer an alternative approach to analyzing producing wells. KDD is the automated extraction of patterns representing knowledge implicitly stored in large information repositories. Distributed, ad hoc field measurements (including MFM and downhole measurements) can be processed by means of data cleaning, data integration, data mining, artificial intelligence (AI), and pattern evaluation. FL can then manage the resulting information in terms of flow assurance and production optimization.The same techniques can also be extended to the reservoir and production network for an integrated approach to production-system analysis.IntroductionProduction wells are the physical connection between the reservoir and the surface facilities. As such, they are part of a production system, which is a network of components through which underground hydrocarbons must flow to reach the surface. It includes and is characterized by the following.The reservoir, with its geological and petrophysical properties, and the properties of the fluids stored within it.The production wells, particularly their completions and any artificial-lift solutions.The flow-control valves, such as the wellhead chokes.The flowlines and any flow-assurance solutions associated with them (such as single or multiphase pumping, thermal isolation, and chemical injection).The separation and treatment facilities, both subsea and at surface.Besides this hardware, the properties of multiphase flows within the reservoir and through the production network must also be taken into account for the production system to be fully characterized. It is common knowledge that variations of any of the previous characteristics are reflected in the rest of the system; therefore, none of the system elements can be considered physically disconnected from the others. This means that the production system can be regarded as integrated.There are several levels of integrated analysis that can be carried out on a production system, depending on what sorts of results are needed. The short-, medium-, and long-term optimization of field management certainly are the main reasons oil companies put so much effort into simulating integrated production systems. Short-term optimization means finding the optimum operational Conditions - choke settings, rate and allocation per well of gas lift gas and chemical injection, separator pressure - that maximize the day-to-day production and honor any physical constraints dictated by the system itself (overall capacity of the network, availability of compressors, slug-handling capacity, and flaring restrictions). Medium- term optimization includes planning startups and shutdowns so that the effects of transients can be smoothed and handled throughout the system. Long-term optimization aims at maximizing the recoverable reserves from the system and may include debottlenecking and topsides modifications to handle larger amounts of water or gas from depleting fields.Optimization can be achieved only by monitoring the field closely and critically reviewing any significant trend in the main parameters of the system. The frequency at which the information must be retrieved from the field is a function of the time dependency of the events being analyzed. Monitoring provides a feel for the lag time between the moment a variation occurs in the system and the moment it is felt by any of the parameters characterizing the system. Thus, una tantum measurements can be enough for steady-state conditions, while real-time monitoring is necessary for accurate verification or prediction of fast-changing conditions.Different levels of analysis may be needed at different stages of field development. The design stage and the early life of a field are the most critical in terms of development planning because very little is known about the potential performance of the field. However, late-life solutions may be critical as well because of the likelihood of more unstable flow conditions associated with depleting systems.Having introduced the concept of integrated production systems, it follows that the best approach to their interpretation and optimization is the simultaneous integration of information from their individual components. Well monitoring and diagnosis, in particular, are the most direct ways of detecting variations in any key parameter of an integrated production system. However, how can we discern what parameters are most representative of significant changes in system properties? Are variations predictable? Can we measure these in the field? Can the information be inferred from standard software packages when it is not possible to get all the necessary data from the field?

AB  - AbstractThe leak-off test (LOT) procedure has been examined within the theoretical framework pertaining to hydraulic fracturing stress measurements (HFSMs). LOT records have then been compared with the results of HFSMs where both measurements have been made in the same boreholes. From this comparison, we make recommendations on the use of LOT data, and suggest a new method of estimating the minimum horizontal stress magnitude ( ) from LOT pressure/volume plots. In-situ stress magnitudes have been investigated by applying these methods to data from over 1000 LOTs in North Sea boreholes. The results of this investigation imply that tectonic stress increases significantly with depth in some parts of the North Sea. which is consistent with the mapped distribution of borehole breakouts.P. 357

AB  - Abstract The Grove field is located in the Southern North Sea and has been in production since 2007. The Grove A well lies within block 49/10a and was originally planned by Centrica as an infill well, drilled horizontally in the central fault compartment of the Grove field structure. The well targeted the relatively undepleted basal "A" sandstone unit of the Late Carboniferous, Westphalian reservoir, also known as the Barren Red Measures (BRM). The well objectives were to 1) target the Grove A sand from the G1 "donor" well, 2) establish a suitable completion strategy for field development, 3) assess the performance of a multiple stage (four to five) hydraulically fractured horizontal well, 4) acquire sufficient log data to fully evaluate the reservoir, and 5) acquire reliable permeability and reservoir pressure measurements to assist in reservoir simulation. The A sand reservoir unit has a porosity of approximately 10% and permeability between 0.05 to 1 md, with a reservoir with true vertical thickness (TVT) of approximately 140 ft at the heel and 40 ft at the toe. The reservoir unit is poorly drained by the other wells, and the Grove infill well is the first horizontal gas well in the field to be stimulated by means of multistage hydraulic proppant fracturing. The hydraulic fracturing treatment used sand plug isolation to separate consecutive fracture stages, and the fracture stimulation operations were performed with the rig in place by means of a converted stimulation vessel. The stimulation treatments successfully used a modified sand plug methodology that employed aggressive breaker schedules and fluid injections rates that were determined to be more efficient than previous treatments based on employing strict "sand plug setting" criteria. The findings are presented, as well as analyses of both prefracturing and fracturing data for the treatments together with results of the well post-completion and hook-up production. This work should be of interest to offshore operators world-wide performing multiple hydraulic fractures in both horizontal and vertical wells using sand plug isolation technology.

AB  - SummaryThis paper describes the subsea aspects of the Magnus field development. The design and installation of the well completions and control systems are described. Problems encountered during this phase and during the early production life of the system are discussed. Some of the longer-term operational aspects are also discussed, and recommendations are made to improve subsequent subsea developments.Project Overview Project Overview The Magnus field was discovered in 1974. Extensive appraisal drilling followed over the next 3 years. The field, which lies in 610 ft 1186 m] of water, is the farthest north of the reservoirs in the East Shetland basin developed to date (see Fig. 1). The undersaturated reservoir, shown in Fig. 2, is in an Upper Jurassic sandstone some 10.000 ft [3000 m] below sea level, with an initial pressure of 6,660 psi [46 MPa]. Recoverable oil reserves are estimated to be 665 x 10 , STB [10 x 10 m3]. A hybrid development program was devised that required a single central platform plus seven subsea satellite wells to drain the extremities of the reservoir and to provide early production in advance of the platform wells. The reservoir depletion strategy requires that the downdip satellite wells along the eastern flank, of the reservoir be converted to water injection after an initial period of oil production. The seven satellite wells include three of the original appraisal wells and four more wells drilled during the period 1978-81. All except one of these wells were drilled, extensively tested, and then suspended pending later completion. Well D6 was completed in Aug. 1981 immediately after drilling ended. The 1991-83 period saw the laying of the subsea flowlines and control umbilicals, completion of the wells, and installation of the production control pods. production control pods. By the time the platform was ready for first oil in mid-Aug. 1983, six of the seven subsea wells were available for production. After a successful startup, the field was producing 100,000 B/D [15 900 m 3 /d] by the end of Sept. 1983.DesignDrilling. A two-stack drilling system was used for all the Magnus exploration, appraisal, and development wells. The system consisted of a 21 1/4 -in., 2,000-psi [54-cm, 14-MPa] outer wellhead attached to the 30-in. [76-cm] conductor, with a 13 5/8-in., 10,000-psi [35-cm, 69-MPa]inner wellhead attached to the 13 3/8-in.[34-cm] casing string, as shown in Fig. 3. Casing setting depths are based on standard design criteria for burst, tensile, and collapse resistance. The 13 3/8-in. [34-cm] casing is set deep enough to case off a zone of overpressurized Tertiary mudstones, allowing lower mud weights to be used in the 12 1/4 -in. [31-cm] hole section. A 9 5/8-in [24-cm] casing is set in Lower Cretaces limestones/mudstones about 160 ft [50 m] above the Magnus reservoir, and a 7-in. [18-cm] liner is run across the reservoir to total depth (TD). The liner hanger is set 500 ft [150 m] inside the 9 5/8-in. [24-cm] shoe.

AB  - ABSTRACT: A laboratory hydraulic fracture experiment was conducted on a Montney shale specimen under the conventional triaxial compressional stress condition. Acoustic emissions (AEs) were recorded using 7 piezoelectric transducers throughout the duration of the test to investigate the hydraulic fracture propagation processes. Distilled water was injected at an average rate of 2.5 mL/min until the sample failed. As expected, a hydraulic fracture formed perpendicular to the externally applied minimum principal stress. Due to the nature of tensile fractures, the relative plasticity of the Montney shale lithology compared to more brittle granitic specimens used in many previous studies, and the reverberatory character of the recorded waveforms, AE seismicity was relatively sparse (600 events) and only a small fraction (about 6%) of AE events could be located. Nevertheless, the hydraulic fracture plane in the middle of the specimen was clearly evident through the hypocenter location plot. In general, locating the AE hypocenters is very challenging compared with granitic materials due to the low signal-to-noise ratio of the waveforms emitted from shale during the hydraulic fracturing process. Moreover, event amplitudes recorded in this experiment are significantly lower than in a previously reported AE experiment where failure occurred under compression.1. INTRODUCTIONHydraulic fracturing has been widely recognized as an efficient method in the development of unconventional oil and gas reservoirs. Microseismic monitoring is useful for imaging the spatial and temporal changes of fracture network (Eaton, 2018). These two techniques have been used extensively in extracting shale gas from ultra-low permeable shale reservoirs, which usually exhibit transversely isotropic characteristics and shale/fluid interactions (Lal, 1999). Current simulation models are often limited by the inability to consider the complex shale behaviors in reality (Weng, 2015), which makes it important to elucidate shale responses to hydraulic fracturing based on experimental observations.Acoustic emissions (AE) are considered to be a proxy of induced microseismicity in higher frequencies (Mogi, 1967), and can therefore provide a further insight on the failure process of hydraulic fractures. Previous studies have demonstrated that the hydraulic fracturing process in shale can be estimated from the sample mechanical behaviour and the AE spatial-temporal distributions (Stanchits et al., 2014; Liang et al., 2016). This study aims to document the hydraulic fracturing process in a Montney shale specimen during fluid injection while monitoring the AE activity to examine the processes of crack propagations. Laboratory setup and procedure are introduced in the first section, and then the results are presented including fracture geometry, AE hypocenters and temporal changes.

AB  - A numerical solution of the 3D Navier-Stokes equations is developed for irrotational flow by introducing a new set of unknowns in the equations making them amenable to a numerical analysis by using the method of characteristics. The efficiency and accuracy of the developed numerical model is successfully validated against a number of benchmark tests including propagation of a second order Stokes wave along a channel, formation of a non linear standing wave inside a basin, propagation of a solitary wave over a constant bed and wave reflection and transmission over a plane bottom slope. INTRODUCTION Water wave propagation and its interaction with uneven bottom, traveling currents, floating bodies, breakwaters and other flow obstacles etc. is an important matter in many applications of ocean and coastal engineering. Therefore, it is not surprising that over the years, a great amount of work has been devoted to methods solving numerically the complex equations describing the phenomenon. In its general form, wave propagation is described by the complete Navier-Stokes equations (NSE) with the inclusion of all non linear terms, viscous and rotational flow effects and non hydrostatic pressure at the surface and within the fluid. While three dimensional NSE based hydrostatic models have been successfully operating for some decades now, for example, in the field of estuarine and coastal flow, it is only recently that research effort has been directed towards the development of non hydrostatic NSE models, mainly, because these models have nowadays become computationally affordable. In the interim period, a reliable intermediate has been developed and applied successfully, despite its computational cost limitations in complicated situations of concern, in the form of depth-integrated, either of the mild slope equation, Boussinesq type or highly nonlinear and dispersive models (for a review, Liu and Losada (2002)).

AB  - SUMMARY The 1997-2002 Yucca Mt. heated drift scale test (DST) used a system of heaters to simulate thermal effects from stored nuclear waste on a tunnel and groundwater flow in volcanic tuff. Seismic calibration shots were recorded on a receiver array installed around the tunnel while the tunnel wall was heated to approximately 200°C. Receiver gathers show classic wave propagation behavior for cylinders/tunnels. However, thermal/groundwater processes cause changes in the direct P-S arrival separation as temperature increases. The seismic waveforms do not change once the final wall temperature is reached. Granite wavespeed measurements were used as a physical analog to develop Vp,s(x, z,t,T) models for Yucca Mt. tuff. Barring 3-D reflections, 2-D spectral element wave modeling coupled with constrained thermal models has replicated receiver data in the calibration source plane. Waveforms using velocity model sets with a V-1dV/dT gradient of -0.5% per 100°C show improved agreement with field data over those with a -2.5% per 100°C gradient. This optimal velocity change is lower than values stated in literature. Because the velocity gradient is small, velocity changes may be controlled by fracturing due to thermal expansion and fragment compression, not large bulk modulus changes associated with groundwater phase transitions. Numerical modeling also shows a diffracted wave propagating perpendicular to the tunnel wall. This wave is present in field and model data with propagation speeds varying with temperature. Therefore, P-S separation and the diffracted wave can potentially be used to monitor conditions near the tunnel. INTRODUCTION This work discusses the processing, analysis and modeling of seismic data collected during the second through fourth years of the 1998-2002 heated drift scale test (DST) at the Yucca Mountain facility, 90 miles NW of Las Vegas, NV (Tsang et al. , 1999; Rutqvist, 2004; TRW Environmental Safety Systems, Inc., 1998). Over four years the tunnel was heated to approximately 200°C by two sets of heating elements to simulate thermal emission from decaying nuclear waste. One set of heaters is a group of canisters located along the axis of the tunnel, with the second set of "wing" heaters extending 15 meters into the rock on either side (Figure 1(a)). Seismic check/calibration shots were collected to verify the functionality of a receiver array installed to monitor seismic activity (Figure 1(b))(Lehtonen, 2005; Rutledge et al. , 2003). Seismic data show an increasing separation between P and S wave arrivals with increasing temperature. We hypothesize that P-S separation is a function of temperature in the surrounding rock and use parametric velocity models based on ground-truth data to model and compare waveforms with the field data. This modeling constrains in-situ velocity changes in the rock to approximately -0.5% of ambient velocity per 100°C. FIELD DATA PROCESSING AND TRENDS A joint effort by the U.S. national labs collected seismic data about the 47.5 meter long, 5 meter diameter tunnel using receivers locations shown by the triangles in Figure 1(b). Each receiver is a single-component instrument assumed to be aligned along the axis of the radially oriented borehole.

AB  - ABSTRACTThe present paper aims to model an extreme event extracted from an experimental time series relative to 2D irregular waves and the subsequent forces on a circular cylinder with a fully nonlinear Navier-Stokes/VOF solver. The computations are carried out in three-dimensions and the force is calculated by spatial pressure integration over the cylinder.In order to reproduce the time series and the consequent loads on the structure, a reconstruction of the wave elevation using a superposition of 1st order components was done assuming that the free surface elevation at any location in the domain can be described by a Fourier series.The first order components were then imported on the aero-servo-elastic code 3D float and the wave kinematics at the inlet for the CFD simulations were thus obtained in form of horizontal velocities up to the free surface and wave elevation.Successively the wave elevation, velocity profile and velocity at the free surface were imported as inlet boundary conditions into the CFD commercial code STAR-CCM+ and let them propagate in the domain. The wave elevation at different locations and the inline force on the model was monitored and compared with the experiments.The time series used for validation were extracted from the test matrix generated within the WaveLoads project where wave tank experiments in scale 1:80 on stiff and flexible monopiles placed on a 1:25 slope were carried out with regular and irregular waves at different water depths. In the present paper the inlet for the computations was placed at a distance of 10 diameters from a 0.075m diameter cylinder. The modeled time series were compared with the experiments for two different wave height Hs and Tp and a single water depth (0.26m corresponding to ca. 20m in full scale). A good agreement between the simulations and the experiments was found.INTRODUCTIONExactly 25 years passed since the first offshore wind farm (Vindeby) (Barthelmie, Courtney, Højstrup, & Sanderhoff, 1994) was installed in Denmark in 1991 and decommissioning is planned the near future (DONG, 2016). Since then, the offshore wind energy market experienced a steep increase not only in terms capacity installed but also in turbine size and reachable water depths. This increase combined with the political interest and goals set by the European Union and with the price reduction of energy generated offshore by wind farms, led to the need of improved models where both substructures and turbines can be designed in a more efficient way, lowering the LCOE.

AB  - ABSTRACT: In this study, we explore the evolution of friction and permeability of a propped fracture using shearing-concurrent measurements of permeability during constant velocity shearing experiments. We separately examine the effects of normal stress (1 MPa, 3 MPa and 5 MPa), proppant thickness (mono-, double- and triple-layer), proppant size (40/80 mesh, 30/50 mesh and 20/40 mesh) and rock texture (Green River shale and Westerly granite) on the frictional and transport response of proppant packs confined between planar fracture surfaces. The results indicate that proppant-absent and proppant-filled fractures show different frictional strength. For fractures with proppants, we observed that (1) the frictional response is mainly controlled by the normal stress and proppant thickness, (2) permeability of the propped fracture is mainly controlled by the magnitude of the normal stress, the proppant thickness and the proppant size. Permeability of the propped fracture decreases during shearing, which is plausibly due to proppant particle crushing and related clogging. Proppants become prone to crushing if the shear loading evolves concurrently with the normal loading. Above combined conclusions suggest the use of high-concentration proppants in the field, which not only provides high hydraulic conductivity for hydro-carbon production, but also help to mitigate the risk of induced seismicity.1. INTRODUCTIONInjection-induced seismicity has been associated with both the operation of waste water reinjection (Keranen et al., 2014) and due to hydraulic fracturing (Bao & Eaton, 2016). Nevertheless, whether induced seismicity can occur during long-term depletion of unconventional fractured reservoirs is of significant scientific interest but remains poorly understood. In the usual conceptual model of conventional hydraulic fracturing, the created fracture plane is perpendicular to the minimum stress direction -thus, there is no shear stress on the fracture as it propagates and before the depletion stage of reservoir production. Post-stimulation, additional shear stresses induced during the depletion process should also be negligible for simple fracture geometry. Once depletion begins, considering the Mohr-Coulomb failure criterion, the gradual decrease in pore pressure will increase the effective clamping stress on the fracture plane (Biot coefficient < 1) and further stabilize the fracture planes (Biot, 1956). Therefore, it can be concluded that the expectation of induced seismicity during conventional hydraulic fracturing is trivial.

AB  - Abstract The objective of this paper is to describe a new methodology for estimating the volume and distribution of hydrocarbons-in-place in the Deep Coal Play (depth>3,000 feet) of the Gidgealpa Group in the Cooper Basin of Australia. Huge volumes of gas, at very high concentrations, are present in the source rock reservoirs of the Deep Coal Play. However, there are no publicly available detailed resource estimates largely because, until recently, the coals have not been considered as potential reservoirs and therefore the majority of the routinely gathered well data are not applicable for estimating coal gas volumes. To circumvent this problem, a new methodology for estimating the hydrocarbon gas content of Deep Coals was developed from the existing mudlog dataset. These data are available for all coal intervals in almost every well drilled in the basin. Normalized (for drilling rate-of-penetration) mud hydrocarbon gas readings from coal layers obtained during the drilling process were compared to total hydrocarbon gas content estimates derived by desorbing coal core samples. This comparison showed a consistent proportional relationship indicating that the mud gas dataset could be used to estimate the hydrocarbon gas content for the Deep Coal Play. This analysis focussed on coals likely to be completed and contribute to production. Thus, Deep Coals greater than 10 feet thick were selected and named Target Deep Coals (TDCs). The average hydrocarbon gas content and some 20 other parameters such as GR, caliper, thermal maturity and rate-of-penetration were documented for all TDCs in 1,300 Cooper Basin wells. For the hydrocarbons-in-place estimate, the Gidgealpa Group was subdivided into 10 lithostratigraphic zones across the Cooper Basin. The individual TDC parameters in each zone were combined to provide per well and zone TDC hydrocarbon content and thickness as inputs for the hydrocarbons-in-place estimate. TDC reservoirs have enough lateral continuity to apply a conventional gridding process for creating 3 realizations (low, deterministic, high) to map the coal thickness. In contrast, the TDC reservoir gas content varies significantly over short distances. This high degree of spatial variability, combined with the large variability in well spacing, required the use of a conditional simulation technique to estimate ranges (P90, P50, P10) of the gas resource. These methods are discussed in the paper, with the Toolachee T1 zone used to illustrate the process. Volumes are world-class. Total hydrocarbons-in-place for the Deep Coal Play for just the Toolachee T1 zone is estimated to be 82 Tscf of gas with 3.9 billion bbl of hydrocarbon liquids. The high gas content values (400-1,000+ scf/ton) and large aggregate thickness (up to 500 feet) of the Cooper Basin coals make them a prime target for exploitation. Work is currently underway by several companies to "crack the code" that will enable economic production. Assuming this becomes a reality, estimates of the in-place gas resource and the location of volumetric "sweet spots" provided by the new process will be of critical importance.

AB  - Abstract This paper presents the findings of a comprehensive structural analysis in which the influence of thermal transient pressure behavior on the trapped annuli in an injection well in a Brazilian pre-salt field was assessed, mainly motivated by physical evidence of a well failure. The study focus on a transient heat flow in radial direction during a well failure investigation, and its impact in tubular design safety factor under a given casing design methodology. During the investigation of this well integrity failure, a thermal analysis was performed considering the well construction history, but standard simulations using a world-class commercial software was not enough to explain the failure. Thus, a modified thermal analysis for casing and tubing was made in order to evaluate the design safety factor during each operation. This modified thermal analysis consists in splitting each operation in short time steps, in order to capture the short transient behavior. It was found that, during short transient time, the collapse stresses reached higher values than predicted in the previous standard steady-state modeling. Such result is basically related to the transient effect caused by radial heat flow. Based on theoretical studies and comparing them to downhole P&T sensors in confined annuli, a correlation was stablished and showed the importance of this type of analysis. In certain scenarios, where the confined annuli are subjected to progressive and non-proportional cooling down effect between the casing layers, a sudden pressure drop may occur in the internal side of the casing, without reaching the same pressure drop on the external side, which can lead to a dramatic external differential pressure for a given string. In wells with multiple confined annuli, such as in ultra-deepwater projects, this type of analysis represents a greater challenge. The results obtained so far have shown that the permanent and transient radial heat flow cannot be neglected in some scenarios and, therefore, open a new frontier for well design, especially when the tubing and multiple casing trapped annuli are subjected to rapid transient cool down.

AB  - SummaryMany deepwater-development projects in operators' portfolios require lowercosts to meet internal economic thresholds.Because of this, Shell haslooked at extending surface-blowout-preventer (BOP) activities to include welltesting and completion techniques for deepwater wells in conjunction withsurface-BOP drilling.The cost advantages of surface-BOP-drilled wells have been demonstrated(notably in the Far East), but the recent surface-BOP-drilled well in Brazil isa milestone in terms of extending the applicability to deeper water and harsherenvironments.The enabling technology has been the subsea isolation device(SID).Testing and completion techniques have been developed to becompatible with surface-BOP wells drilled with an SID.This paper focuses on the following aspects:•Well testing using surface-BOPs from a moored rig and•Well completions using surface-BOPs from a moored rig.Shell has developed a testing configuration to carry out a DST, essentiallyusing standard equipment. The well-testing equipment configuration is currentlyready for use and has been run in a subsea-BOP well.In completion operations, the availability of a high-pressure (HP) riserdoes not add significant complexity and even actually simplifies some of thecompletion activities.Conceptual studies and early hazard/riskassessments have shown there are no obvious "showstoppers," and the duration ofa surface-BOP-rig completion is expected to be very similar to a subsea-BOP-rigcompletion.This paper describes the results of the conceptual studies, early hazardassessment exercises used to define the basic design parameters, and moredetailed hazop studies.IntroductionAs deepwater exploration and development move into even deeper water andmore arduous environments, operators are looking at ways to reduce well coststo make prospects and developments economically more attractive.One ofthe key avenues seen to do this is to accomplish drilling, testing, andcompleting wells by use of smaller deepwater rigs, consequently resulting in areduction in rig rates.Surface-BOP technology facilitates the deploymentof smaller rigs in deeper water, thus lowering day rates, well costs, andfield-development costs.To date, most ultradeepwater wells (in which water depth is greater than5,000 ft) have been executed using the latest generation of new or converteddrilling vessels (these will be referred to as "Generation V" rigs).Over150 subsea wells in varying water depths have now been executed with floatingrigs with surface-BOPs in locations around the world.In 1967, asemisubmersible rig (Sedco-135) was used to drill a subsea well by use ofsurface-BOPs offshore Nigeria in EA-3.Since then, a number of operatorshave pioneered the use of surface-BOPs with moored rigs in the benignenvironmental conditions of the Far East.Shell has recently usedsurface-BOPs on a Generation V dynamically positioned (DP) rig to extend the7,500-ft-water-depth capability of the rig—drilling a deepwater explorationwell in 9,474 ft of water offshore Brazil.1 The trend is to take this techniqueand apply it in a number of deepwater-operating areas with older Generation IIIand IV rigs that were not specifically built for deepwater operation.Thispaper outlines the well-testing and well-completion approaches that are plannedto meet these challenges.The overall surface-BOP system will be described followed by the descriptionof well-testing and well-completion methodologies.It should be noted thatthese methodologies are continuously worked on and refined; once actualexperience is gained, they will, of course, change and be furtheroptimized.

AB  - Abstract According to the functional safety standard IEC 61508 (2010), requirements apply to Safety Instrumented Functions (SIFs) for achieving a certain Safety Integrity Level (SIL). A typical SIF comprises of initiators (e.g. sensors), logic solvers and final elements (e.g. valves). A common method for SIF equipment vendors to document compliance with the standard is the use of SIL product certificates. This can be an efficient way of demonstrating functional safety compliance, but also involves certain challenges which will be discussed in this paper. A study has been undertaken to identify recurring issues in functional safety compliance. This study is based on experience with SIL projects undertaken for various vendors, integrators/engineering companies and operators. The projects comprise SIL Failure Mode, Effects and Diagnostic Analyses (FMEDAs), safety manuals, certifications and SIL compliance reports. The main aim of the study is to identify challenges and pitfalls and to provide solutions for preparing traceable and unambiguous compliance documentation. During the study it became evident that final elements presented unique challenges to SIL compliance, so this paper particularly focuses on documenting compliance for valves. The study reveals challenges related to the methodology used to reach a rational conclusion to the integrity of SIF elements covered in each certificate. This especially relates to definition of safe state for the relevant SIFs. It is important to have a clear and unambiguous definition of safe state, as this might give a different result regarding compliance. Clearly stating the application where the element is going to be used is important; this includes operational and environmental conditions. Challenges are also related to the failure rate derivation and whether the scope of the FMEDA is the element isolated or the element in a given application/system. The paper presents concrete examples of challenges, describes the impact of erroneous analyses and proposes solutions for each challenge. This paper considers best practices for issuing SIL certificates, limitations and advantages of SIL certification, and methods to ensure efficient compliance documentation, reliable results, and avoidance of the challenges discussed.

AB  - Abstract Multiple assisted history matching (AHM) techniques commonly applied in the oil and gas industry were benchmarked for their applicability to field studies. The benchmarking effort was aimed at exploration of the theoretical as well as practical benefits, challenges and tradeoffs of the AHM techniques as they are utilized for asset development and reservoir management. This paper specifically discusses benchmarking of ensemble-based methods as applied for history matching of a key deepwater asset for the corporation. Two variations of ensemble-based methods are examined: the ensemble Kalman filter (EnKF) (Evensen, 2009) and the ensemble smoother with multiple data assimilation (ES-MDA) (Emerick and Reynolds, 2013). In both techniques, the ensemble of parameter estimates evolves as field data are assimilated into the reservoir characterization, either sequentially using the EnKF or iteratively using the ES-MDA. Both of these variations have been deployed with adaptive bootstrap-based screening (Zhang and Oliver, 2011) to reduce the sampling error of ensemble estimates. One significant strength of ensemble-based methods is their ability to estimate high-resolution model parameters. In this benchmark study, however, the ensemble-based methods were applied for estimation of a group of low-resolution model parameters including regional property multipliers and pilot points. The insights gained from the inverse problem of constraining reservoir simulation models to historical production data can be particularly valuable in guiding the practitioner in re-definition of the prior model uncertainty and towards the model solution. The study shows that a major challenge in the application of ensemble-based methods is parameter over-adjustment resulting from the improper addition of observation errors associated with the actual observations. In practice, multiple experiments are required for the user to iteratively improve the optimal level of the added errors. As the number of observations grows large, the increase in computational cost and decrease in ensemble variability are additional challenges in the application of ensemble-based methods. While assimilating different types of data, a balanced proportion of these data types should be maintained. These points are illustrated and discussed in the field application section of the paper.

AB  - Abstract A common cause of failure with surface-controlled, subsurface safety valves (SC-SSSV) is a defect in the down-hole hydraulic line, which controls the valve from the surface. Such a failure generates production losses and requires the intervention of a costly workover rig - usually not immediately available. In order to alleviate this type of situation, a system has been developed where the physical control line has been replaced by a communication system based on electromagnetic waves. The surface emitter continuously sends a signal to the SC-SSSV. Both items are designed to be fail-safe. The normally-closed valve remains open while receiving the signal and closes as soon as the signal is lost. This innovative, control-line free, wireline-retrievable SC-SSSV can be set in any landing nipple profile or anywhere in the tubing using monobore lock technology without a workover or well head modification. The primary application is to secure wells with a damaged or blocked control line, damaged landing nipple, or wells completed without an SC-SSSV. It provides an immediate cost-effective solution - allowing production to resume with a surfacecontrollable safety barrier while avoiding or postponing a costly workover. With the arrival of this technology, sub-standard and temporary solutions, such as the normally-open velocity and ambient valves, no longer need to be considered. Another application is to free up a hydraulic SC-SSSV landing nipple in order to install a device like a capillary string for chemical or gas injection at the bottom of the well safely. A prototype has been built and successfully tested for six months in a flowing gas well with 15% H2S - the case history is presented. The tool has proven to be easy to install and reliable. Deployment will start in 2008. Thousands of wells are concerned around the world. This breakthrough slickline product offers new possibilities for safely and efficiently managing the countless failures of hydraulic SC-SCSSVs. Its versatility brings a reduction in production losses and provides the user with a cost-effective and reliable solution. Introduction LACQ field has been developed from 1951 to 1957 while solving metallurgical constraint due to the 15% H2S and 10% CO2 in its gas composition. At few kilometers, MEILLON, SAINT FAUST and PONT D'AS fields which produce the same long and narrow reservoir have started production late 1967.

AB  - AbstractWe used optimal control theory to develop optimization algorithms for the valve settings in smart wells. We focussed on their use in injectors and producers for waterflooding of heterogeneous reservoirs. As a follow-up to an earlier, intuitive, optimization approach, we developed systematic algorithms and investigated the effect of well constraints on the scope for optimization. The objective was to maximize recovery or net present value over a given time period. We concluded that: 1) For wells operating on bottom hole pressure constraints the benefit of using smart wells is mainly reduced water production rather than increased oil production. 2) For wells operating on rate constraints, there is a very large scope for accellerating production and increasing recovery, in combination with a drastic reduction in water production.IntroductionIn an earlier study, we investigated the static optimization of water flooding with smart wells, using heuristic algorithms1. Static implies that the injection and production rates of the inflow control valves (ICVs) in the wells were kept constant during the displacement process, until water breakthrough at the producers occurred. Later, we addressed the same problem using an optimization technique known as optimal control theory2. In addition to being more systematic, this technique allowed for dynamic water flooding control, through varying the flow rates over time. Optimal control theory has been used before in reservoir engineering. Fathi and Ramirez used it to optimize surfactant flooding processes3,4, Mehos to optimize CO2 flooding5, Liu to optimize steam flooding6, and Zakirov et al. to optimize production from a thin oil rim7. Furthermore, the same technique has been used in history matching reservoir models with production data. Optimization of water flooding using optimal control theory has been studied before by Asheim8, Virnovski9, Sudaryanto & Yortsos10,11,12 and Dolle et al.2. The optimization objective was either to maximize water breakthrough time at given field rates, or to maximize cumulative oil production or net present value (NPV) within a given time. In all these water flood optimization cases, the flow in the reservoir was controlled with wells that operated at constant field injection and production rates, i.e. the total injection and production rates were kept constant but the distribution over the wells was changed over time. In real life, however, a production strategy with constant field rates will often not be feasible, because it would require unrealistic bottom hole pressures, e.g. too low pressures at the producers, resulting in lift die-out, or too high pressures at the injectors, exceeding maximum allowable formation or equipment pressures. In the present study we investigated the scope for dynamic optimization for the two extreme cases of well constraints. The first extreme is the completely rate-constrained case with constant field rates for injection and production, and no pressure constraints. The other extreme is the completely pressure constrained case in which the field rates cannot be controlled directly.

AB  - AbstractThe economy of subsea production systems must be improved to maintain the viability of future projects. However any cost saving solutions must recognize strict safety requirements. Further; reducing the rated working pressure of a pipeline below the maximum working pressure of the well, presents an interesting dichotomy between safety and production downtime. This paper reports various methods to down rate equipment protected by HIPPS, with respect to the above issues.In addition to discussion and analysis, some HIPPS design options to be qualified in an ongoing qualification project are presented. The qualification testing is scheduled to be finalized by the end of 1997.IntroductionSubsea production flowlines are normally rated for the full wellhead shut-in pressure, but often utilized to a small fraction of this capacity to flow the product. The excess capacity may in some cases be prohibitively expensive for the field development. It is therefore a market desire to have protection systems available in order to rate the pipeline closer to the flowing pressure. HIPPS is one such system, in that it allows rapid closure of the inflow to the pipeline upon an unwanted pressure increase. This pressure increase may be the result of an unexpected obstruction of the line further downstream. HIPPS, or HIPS as it has also been called, has never before been utilized subsea. Offshore topsides and onshore applications are numerous, some of which are referred to in OTC Paper 7828 /Ref.: 1/.A two-year HIPPS qualification project was started in January 1996, with the aim of having a fully qualified suite of components and systems for subsea HIPPS applications ready by the end of 1997. The testing includes integration testing of the components and sub-systems. The authors behind this paper are team members of this qualification project. The paper reports on some of the system analyses that have been performed to support selection of components and their requirements. The scope of this paper includes effects on the subsea system outside the exclusion zone of the topside facility. All equipment within this zone is assumed to be designed according to present practice. HIPPS may also have substantial positive effects on the integrity of the pressure containment systems within the exclusion zone, since high pressure situations are less likely to occur than without HIPPS. HIPPS RiskExpected risk associated with introduction of HIPPS may be split in three main areas for analysis. The three areas are: Expected number of HIPPS demands Reliability of HIPPS Consequence of simultaneous demand and HIPPS failureThese areas are discussed and analyzed, in reverse order, in the following sections.Pipeline or Flowline ConsequencesThe consequences of a HIPPS failure upon a demand depends on the stored volume, pressure, type of fluid, etc. in the system and the probability of its release. Difference between the maximum obtainable pressure and the maximum allowable pressure for the pipeline is one of the main drivers for this mentioned probability. This difference may be selected for each application depending on field specific requirements and configurations. In other words:

AB  - Abstract This paper demonstrates, via a comprehensively described recent case history, the transfer of established completion technology into the North Sea. Further, in performing the process the technique has been successfully extended beyond its normal criteria of application. Today artificial lift in the Forties Field is provided by a large number of electric submersible pumps (ESPs) lifting from shale inter-bedded sandstone sequences. Overall production is affected by the achieved ESP run-life in a field where sand-face failure is not uncommon. ESP failure in the Forties Delta well FD5-1 was found to be due to pack-off from a high proportion of fine shale/siltstone in addition to formation sand. Although simultaneous fracturing and gravel packing are commonly performed in other hydrocarbon producing regions none had been directed at controlling the mechanism of flowing shales and/or claystones. The well intervention was designed to protect the ESP from shale or sand grain production and provide minimal impairment to well productivity. Both objectives were achieved by increasing the formation face area for inflow and in so doing physically support the formation face in the first such frac and pack treatment executed in the UK Sector of the North Sea. ESP protection was achieved and subsequent well productivity was show to be minimally affected by the presence of the gravel pack. This case history describes the formation failure mechanism; the detailed corrective well intervention and the resulting well productivity in bring well FD5-1 successfully back into full production up-time. Introduction Forties is a 5 Bbls OOIP oil field in the central UK North Sea.  Production began in 1975 and cumulative production to-date in nearly 2.6 Bstb.    In the early days, Forties reached sustained production rates over 500 Mstb/d.  When Apache acquired the majority of the field equity in April 2003 field production was averaging about 40 Mstb/d.  Through a combination of new drilling, workovers, and major facilities upgrades, Apache has significantly grown production, see Fig 1. Production lift is provided by gas lift and ESPs. ESP uptime has a major effect on production revenue. Run times have ranged from days to over four years. EPS typically malfunction either due to electrical insulation failure (e.g. cables or windings, ingress of aqueous fluids in to motor etc.) or due to mechanical failure (e.g. seized shaft, seal failures etc.). These mechanical failures are often due to the operating environment such as solid contaminants within the flow stream causing abrasion, and in severe cases packoff, of the impellors. The Delta platform comprises one of five fixed leg multi-slot platforms draining the Forties field, see Fig 2. Wellbores commonly feature a history of one or more production sidetracks to exploit the hydrocarbon bearing sands at ~2,100mTVD. The current producing sands in well FD5-1 are interbedded with shale/siltstone sequences, see Fig 3. Each sand body is in order of 1 - 2 m thick with a permeability range of 50 - 400 md interbedded with shale/siltstone sequences of 0.5 - 3 m. As such it originally proved expedient and cost effective to blanket perforate the entire interval when completed in 2005. Production from the well ceased in February2006 after indications of internal plugging of the completion. A subsequent slick line bailer run retrieved samples of fine shale/siltstone from a hold up depth above the ESP, see Fig 4. An analysis of the sample showed the majority to be very fine sand grains and silt originating from the perforated shale/siltstone sequences, see Fig 5. A suitable intervention now needed to be executed to prevent this fine material being removed from the formation face to a) prevent future plugging of the new ESP and b) prevent local destabilization of the sands at the perforations due to the removal of supporting adjacent material.

AB  - Abstract: The purpose of this paper is to study the growth of hydraulic fractures in anisotropic rocks such as shale. The boundary value problems of anisotropic materials often are difficult to solve due to the mathematical complexity, therefore such problems are treated numerically under the assumption of isotropy even though such assumption rarely holds in reality. This paper uses the constant element anisotropic displacement discontinuity method (ADDM) for fracture deformation with square root elements at crack tips to calculate stress intensity factors accurately. 3D correction factor G is also developed for anisotropic DDM to include height effect in 2D problems using the analytical solution for stress distribution around a line crack in orthotropic material. The crack propagation is modeled according to the normal stress ratio criterion which accounts elliptically varying fracture toughness while calculating crack trajectory. Crack extension occurs when mode-1 stress intensity factor at tips reaches a critical value KIC (φ). The fracture deformation is fully coupled with fluid flow inside the fracture by solving all the unknowns simultaneously using globally convergent Newton-Raphson method. The simulation results show significant difference in fracture geometries and apertures between isotropic and anisotropic materials. In anisotropic rock, the direction of plane of elastic symmetry w.r.t fracture influences the fracture geometry. Simulations of multi-stage single lateral fracturing, multi-lateral zipper fracturing in anisotropic shale are included. Introduction Shale is categorized as an anisotropic rock at different scales. Intrinsic anisotropy of elastic properties of shale is often attributed to the composition of the shale and preferred orientation of platy clay particles. [Josh et al., 2012] Correlated the degree of anisotropy in shales to the amount of clay and organic content present in it. At field scale all rocks exhibit anisotropy in some form. Naturally fractured rocks are softer in the direction perpendicular to the fractures. For example rock with 3 mutually perpendicular sets of fracture systems can be considered as an orthotropic material in the analysis of rock deformation [Goodman, 1976]. Also micro-cracks can lead to the evolution of stress-induced anisotropy in shales [Dewhurst and Siggins, 2006, Sone, 2012]. The degree of anisotropy in this case depends on the orientation of micro-cracks w.r.t to principal stresses. Along with elastic anisotropy, the shales also exhibit strong strength anisotropy due to the presence of bedding planes. The tensile strength of shale when load is applied perpendicular to the bedding is less compared to case when the load is applied parallel to the bedding. The bedding acts as a plane of weakness that promotes early failure when tension is applied perpendicular to it. [Suarez-Rivera et al., 2011] Reported degree of anisotropy observed in elastic modulus, compressive and tensile strengths measured parallel and perpendicular to the bedding planes for various mudstones. The degree of anisotropy in Young's modulus for the 7 reported samples varied from 1.05 to 4.01.

AB  - Abstract Giant reservoirs of the Middle East are crucial for the supply of oil and gas to the world market. Proper simulation of these giant reservoirs with long history and large amount of static and dynamic data requires efficient parallel simulation technologies, powerful visualization and data processing capabilities. This paper describes GigaPOWERS, a new parallel reservoir simulator capable of simulating hundreds of millions of cells to a billion cells with long production history in practical times. The new simulator uses unstructured grids. A distributed unstructured grid infrastructure has been developed for models using unstructured or complex structured grids. Unconventional wells such as maximum reservoir contact wells and fish-bone wells, as well as faults and fractures are handled by the new gridding system. A new parallel linear solver has been developed to solve the resulting linear system of equations. Load balancing issues are also discussed. A unified compositional formulation has been implemented. The simulator is designed to handle n-porosity systems. An optimization-based well management system has been developed by using mixed integer nonlinear programming. In addition to the core computational algorithms, the paper will present the pre- and post-processing software system to handle large amount of data. Visualization techniques for billions of cells are also presented. Introduction For many oil and gas reservoirs, especially large reservoirs in the Middle East, availability of vast amount of seismic, geological and dynamic reservoir data result in high-resolution geological models.  But despite the many benefits of parallel simulation technology for large reservoirs, average cell size still remains in the order of hundreds of meters for large reservoirs.  In order to fully utilize the seismic data, smaller grid blocks such as 25 to 50 meters in length are required.  This size of grid blocks results in billion (Giga) cell models for giant reservoirs. In order to simulate such models with reasonable turnaround time, new innovations in the main components of the simulator such as linear equation solvers and equation of state computations are essential. Also, next generation pre- and post-processing tools are needed in order to build and analyze giga-cell models in practical times.

AB  - ABSTRACT:Egyptian natural monopode Gas Platforms use HIPPS to protect process equipment integrity during an over-pressurisation events instead of vent stacks, which are not compatible with the platform structure. In addition, the HIPPS adoption gives a significant cost saving without any important reduction in platform safety and minimise environmental impact problems. This paper describes the work performed to validate the overall platform design, with a special emphasis on the solution to implement the HIPPS. An Audit of platform control and protection system has been performed to identify the most critical components, especially those used for the protection against overpressurization to verify any weak point design. All the analysis performed demonstrate that the adoption of HIPPS does not reduce in any way the overall platform safety level in terms of over-pressurisation risk.
