AB  - ABSTRACTAs offshore oil fields are being developed towards deeper and deeper waters, new technologies are required to curb capital expenditures. In Brazil, where oil consumption is increasing and huge oil fields lie in high water depths, the issue is particularly pressing. Earlier and higher oil production from those oil fields could be attained by the use of Electrical Submersible Pumps (ESP), so far restricted to dry completions. Also longer distances from well to platform would be made practical. For the initial phase of this development, Petrobras worked together with Tronic, Reda, Piralli, Lasalle, Sade- Vigesa and Cooper. As a result, first-in-the-world ESP installation in a subsea well has been successfully achieved on October/f 994 in RJS-221, located at Carapaba Field, Campos Basin, Brazil. BRAZILIAN OFFSHORE OIL FIELD SCENARIOThe development of deep water oil fields in Brazil has been leading to the use of floating production systems linked to subsea central manifolds and to satellite wells. Oil flow from subsea wells is driven by natural reservoir pressure aided by gas lift injection, whenever necessary, as no other artificial lift method was available for subsea production. For each field, well-to-platform distances are limited to the reach of reservoir pressures, which decline with depletion, requiring water injection. Gas lift is of little help for that matter, once it becomes less efficient as orizontal distanoes increase and BSW rises. This scenario requires many deep water platforms to cover a large drainage area and renders uneconomical any distant reservoir that is not large enough to hold a new platform. A new method was needed, that by adding energy to produced fluids, would increase flow rates and thedistance from subsea wells to platforms., allowing for lower capital and operational costs and higher recovery factor. ELECTRICAL SUBMERSIBLE PUMPS IN SUBSEA WELLSIn order to study alternative methods of artificial lift for subsea wells, a Project was created as part of the Technological Innovation Program for Deep and Ultra- Deep Water (PROCAP 2000) by the end of 1992. After an evaluation of the available methods in the market, priority was given to the Electrical Submersible Pump (ESP) system as the most advanced and, at the same time well known and widely used lift method in dry completions. The studies indicated that the equipment required for the installation of an electrical submersible pumping system in a subsea well could be made available in the short time. In fact, some components had already been laboratory tested. Some could be developed from existing technology. In parallel, technical and cost feasibility studies have led to the identification of suitable scenarios for the application of this new technology, particularly the giant oil fields of Albaoora, Marlim and Barracuda. Figure 1 compares production rates of ESP with several different run lives against gas lift for a well in Albacora deep water field. The use of ESPS would allow for a higher production of oil. Wells equipped with ESPS, however, require more frequent workover as opposed to gas lift wells, implying in higher production costs, specially in deep waters.

AB  - AbstractDue to the sand excavation and reclamation the hydrodynamics changed obviously in this region over past 30 years. To understand the hydrodynamics in different bathymetries, a 2-D flow and sediment numerical model covered the entire Pearl River Estuary was established. Because of the influence of topography, the net discharge in Humen and Jiaomen decreased while Modaomen increased during the wet seasons. In the dry and wet seasons, Western side played a dominant role in controlling the water transport, however, the surface water of Southern side moved seaward in wet season and moved landward in dry season.

AB  - ABSTRACTAlloy 22 (UNS N06022) and Ti Grade 7 (UNS R52400) are the current corrosion-resistant materials of choice for fabricating the waste package outer barrier and the drip shield, respectively, for the proposed high-level nuclear waste repository at Yucca Mountain. In this work, the general and crevice corrosion behavior of annealed and welded Alloy 22 and Ti Grade 7 exposed in basic saturated water (BSW-12) for four and eight weeks at 60°C to 105°C were evaluated using the ASTM G78 method combined with surface analysis and statistical analysis of corrosion rate. The general corrosion rates for Alloy 22 and Ti Grade 7 were found to increase linearly with temperature but decrease with the exposure time. The mean corrosion rate was found to be 0.003 mpy (0.075 µm/y) at 60°C and 0.010 mpy (0.25 µm/y) at 105°C for Alloy 22 and 0.008 mpy (0.20 µm/y) at 60°C and 0.022 mpy (0.56 µm/y) at 105°C for Ti Grade 7. No significant difference in corrosion behavior between the annealed and welded materials was observed. For both materials the surface imperfections inherited from materials processing did not seem to deteriorate the excellent corrosion resistance of the materials but might serve as the "traps" for corrosion products. The apparent activation energies for the temperature dependence of corrosion rates of Ti Grade 7 and Alloy 22 in BSW-12 environment were obtained as 25.3 (±5.5) KJ/mol and 23.7 (±4.5) KJ/mol, respectively. Although none of the materials was found susceptible to crevice corrosion under the test conditions, to conclude thatThe Nuclear Waste Policy Act of 1982 as amended in 1987 designated Yucca Mountain in Nevada as the potential site to be characterized for high-level nuclear waste (HLW) disposal.1 In 2002, the Secretary of the United States Department of Energy recommended Yucca Mountain to the U.S. president to be the designated repository site, citing "sound science" and "compelling national interests." The design concept for geological containment of HLW is a double-wall canister structure with an inner structural container and an outer concentric barrier made of the corrosion-resistant material. This concept was later modified to the current "Enhanced Design Alternative" (EDA).2 The EDA for geological containment of HLW includes a two-layer waste canister structure with the outer layer made of the highly corrosion-resistant Ni-based Alloy 22 (UNS N06022)(1) fitting concentrically over an inner structural barrier fabricated from Type 316 NG (nuclear grade [UNS S31600]) stainless steel. The whole package will be covered by a self-supported Ti Grade 7 (UNS R52400) mailbox-shaped drip shield.3-4 The current design concepts for the waste package and drip shield are shown schematically in Figures 1(a) and (b), respectively.3-4 The minimum target lifetime for containment of HLW without exceed-

AB  - ABSTRACTAlloy 22 (UNS N06022) and Ti Grade 7 (UNS R52400) have been proposed as the corrosion resistant materials for fabricating the waste package outer barrier and the drip shield, respectively, for the proposed nuclear waste repository Yucca Mountain Project. In this work, the susceptibility of welded and annealed Alloy 22 and Ti Grade 7 to crevice corrosion was studied by the multiple crevice assembly (ASTM G78) method combined with surface morphological observation after four and eight weeks of exposure to the basic saturated water (BSW-12) in a temperature range from 60 ° to 105°C. The susceptibility of the materials to crevice corrosion was evaluated based on the appearance of crevice attack underneath the crevice formers and the weight loss data. The results showed that, after being exposed to BSW-12 for four and eight weeks, no obvious crevice attack was observed on these materials. The descaled weight loss increased with the increase in temperature for all materials. The weight loss, however, is believed to be caused by general corrosion, rather than crevice corrosion. There was no significant difference between the annealed and welded materials either. On the other hand, to conclude that these materials are immune to crevice corrosion in BSW-12 will require long- term testing. INTRODUCTIONThe Nuclear Waste Policy Act of 1982 as amended in 1987 designated Yucca Mountain in Nevada as the proposed site to be characterized for high-level nuclear waste (HLW) disposal [1 ]. The design concept for geological containment of HLW is a double-wall canister structure with an inner structural container and an outer concentric barrier made of the corrosion-resistant material. Earlier designs used Alloy 825, later changed to Alloy 22 as the inner corrosion resistant barrier, with an outer structural barrier of "corrosion allowance" carbon steel. This concept was later modified to the current so-called "Enhanced Design Alternative" (EDA) [2]. With the EDA design concept, the outer corrosion resistant barrier is made of a 20-mm-thick Alloy 22 cylinder concentric with a 50-mm-thick inner structural barrier cylinder fabricated from Type 316 NG (nuclear grade) stainless steel. The weld sealed waste packages will be emplaced in the drifts (tunnels) under a self-supported 15-mm thick Ti Grade 7 mailbox shaped drip shield [3]. The minimum target lifetime for containment of HLW without failure is 10,000 years [4]. In this most current design, test results to date [2] indicate Alloy 22 will not undergo localized corrosion in the range of expected aqueous environments. The objectives of the current investigation were 1) to evaluate the susceptibility of Alloy 22 and Ti Grade 7 to crevice corrosion in a potential waste package/drip shield surface environment and 2) providing the material exhibited susceptibility to crevice corrosion, to determine the critical crevice corrosion temperature. The objectives were to be achieved by studying the crevice corrosion behavior of welded and annealed Alloy 22 and welded and annealed Titanium Grade 7 in a highly concentrated site groundwater, the basic saturated water (BSW-12), at six selected temperatures (60°C, 70°C, 80°C, 90°C, 100°C, and 105°C). The evaluation was primarily based on weight loss and morphological observations after the test. All tests, except the SEM and EDS, were performed in compliance with the Office of Civilian Radioactive Waste Management (OCRWM) Quality Program.

AB  - AbstractIn October /1994 PETROBRAS, leading a team of six companies (Reda, Lasalle, Tronic, Pirelli , Cameron, Sade-Vigesa ) has installed for the first time in the world an Electrical Submersible Pump in a subsea well . The subsea ESP system in the well RJS-221, located in 86 meters water depth, in the Carapeba oilfield, completed two years and ten months in operation without failures. The success of this pioneer installation has encouraged PETROBRAS to start Phase II of this PROCAP 2000 project, in order to extend the application of this new technology from 300 meters water depth ( limit of power cable design on Phase I ) into deep water and long platform/well distances. Since 2/June/1998 an ESP operates in Deepwater for the first time: in the subsea well 4-RJS-477A , located in 1109 meters water depth, in the East-Albacora Oilfield, Campos Basin, razil. The oil is produced over nearly 8,5 Km to the production platform, located in the neighbor Albacora Oilfield.The development of ESP components, of a Guidelineliness Horizontal Tree, Power Cables, Subsea Power Transformer, Power Connectors, the integration of all these subsystems, many of them unique in the market, and their installation in the field will be the main focus of this paper, that intends to demonstrate the viability and importance of this new technology to develop offshore oilfields, specially in deepwater.IntroductionIn the 80s, Petrobras has found very important reservoirs in deepwater and initiated a Program for the development of Deepwater Technology: the so-called Procap. The excellent results from Procap and new reservoir discoveries in even deeper waters have stimulated Petrobras to undertake a new Phase: the Procap 2000. By the end of 1992, a project portfolio was created including a project to develop alternatives of artificial lift for subsea wells.At that time oil production in the Brazilian coast was started to be planned for the giant deepwater reservoirs and the development of these fields would make use mainly of floating production systems, that receive the production directly from the subsea satellite wells or from subsea manifolds. Subsea wells would bring longer flowlines and other aspects that also impact flowrates, like well depletion and reservoir specific limitations. Production from subsea wells was for a long time based on natural flow or aided by the artificial lift method of gas lift or even by water injection in the reservoir to reduce pressure decline rates. But the efficiency of these solutions is not high and they are not always feasible. Reservoir pressure may be insufficient to produce over long distances and gas lift loses a lot of efficiency in long horizontal flowlines, typical of subsea wells, as well as with the BSW increase. This scenario required a new method of artificial lift, that could mainly deal with oil production over long distances, specially from deepwater wells, allowing the platform to be placed in shallow waters, allow for a reduction in the number of platforms, thus simplifying the production layout, reducing the investments, a key factor in deepwater, increasing and anticipating production. Some alternatives were in the market, but among them, the Electrical Submersible Pumps seemed to be most suitable to meet the requirements. The project started, in fact, in 1993. In October 1994, the first in the world subsea ESP was installed in Campos Basin still in shallow waters. This well produced over 2 years and 10 months before a failure. With such a successful prototype, Petrobras was stimulated to move further and in June 1998 the first in the world deepwater ESP started to produce from the deep waters of Campos Basin.

AB  - ABSTRACT The uniaxial, unconfined compressive strengths of Kayenta sandstone specimens, ranging over some six orders of magnitude and up to a cubic meter in volume, do not in a statistically significant way depend on sample size. The observed, but slight variations in the experimental results produced by laboratory and field tests are of the order of a few tens of percent and, most likely, reflect uncertainties in experimental procedures and environmental conditions, particularly moisture content. The published results of an equally extensive testing program on an altered igneous rock (quartz diorite) are compiled and reviewed to reveal an abrupt decrease in measured strengths between specimens tested in the laboratory and those tested in place at the field site. Furthermore, neither data subset shows a significant strength dependence on size. Differences in moisture content may account for some of the discrepancy in strengths, but no documentation exists to quantify this environmental effect. As observed in and confirmed by the field tests on sandstone, nonuniform loading may cause the strengths of quartz diorite field specimens to be underestimated. INTRODUCTIONSize effect implies a certain degree of dependence of mechanical properties on volume; specifically, it refers to the volume dependence of unconfined, uniaxial strength of intact rock and other brittle materials, either in tension or compression. The variation in tensile strength of most materials is usually a decreasing function of volume; however, the degree of variation depends in large measure on experimental conditions, stress gradients, and geometric (shape) factors. For instance, a rather pronounced size effect on the tensile strength of rock is observed in practically all versions of the Brazilian test and in thick-walled hollow-cylinder tests. If, on the other hand, the applied tensile loads are as uniform as possible (e.g., the direct tensile test), the size effect becomes subdued and, in some instances, may not even be statistically significant (Wijk et al., 1978). With very few exceptions, the volume dependence of compressive strength of rock is slight. Brown (1971), in his review of the size-strength effects in rock, reiterates that there are three general types of size effects: namely, with increasing size compressive strengths either decrease, increase, or increase at first and then decrease. In equally general terms, the decreasing type of strength-size effect characterizes the behavior of hard, low-porosity igneous and some metamorphic rocks, whereas the soft, more porous sedimentary rocks may display an increasing strength-size effect. Observing all three types of size effect in as many major rock types, Obert et al. (1946) nevertheless conclude, on the basis of Tchebycheff's statistical theorem (ibid., pp. 56-59), that no size effect is apparent. To explain the decreasing size effect on tensile strength, one may seek out some version of statistical fracture mechanics. The simplest of these, due to Weibull (see Brown, 1971, or Ratigan, 1982), assumes a serial arrangement of elementary "volumes" and each possessing a strength within a certain distribution about the mean. The implied geometry is consistent with steel wires and glass filaments pulled in tension. To predict the results of similar tests on rocks, Brown (1971) and Pretorius (1972) propose that a more realistic approach would be to consider the strength distribution in parallel and series arrangements of elementary volumes in a composite.

AB  - Mexico's oil production has been declining for the last decade. Therefore, the country has established strategies to increase oil production including the acquisition of new technology to produce unconventional reservoirs as well as the implementation of new regulations to enhance recovery rates from mature fields and develop the shallow-water and deepwater areas. This paper presents a detailed analysis of Mexico's new hydrocarbons legislation with special focus on the contracting and bidding processes. This research also considers available data to identify the main technical challenges associated with the contractual areas which ultimately may be crucial in increasing oil production. Prospective production from main Mexican reservoirs was evaluated using a probabilistic method based on decline curve analysis (DCA) to forecast Mexico's oil production and its effect on North America oil production outlook. The results of the technical evaluation of the contractual areas along with the analysis of the new policies indicate optimistic scenarios for the development of projects and a potential increase in oil production. These projects will foster offset decline of oil production by attracting experienced companies capable of facing current technical challenges and increasing upstream investment. Furthermore, areas of opportunity in the new regulations were identified to make the project conditions more attractive for companies and government. This study is built upon the exhaustive analysis of the new legislation and characteristics of the contractual areas in the context of the current internal and external factors to forecast Mexico's oil production scenario.

AB  - ABSTRACT: An approach to the optimization of drilling tools which is based on the analysis of dependence of drilling cost on the tool shape is presented. The effect of tool shape on the energy consumption in rotatory drilling and on the lifetime of tool is studied analytically. It is shown that the main part of drilling energy is consumed not for the rock removal, but rather by the microfracture, shearing and crushing of rock in the zone of high hydrostatic pressure under the tool/rock contact surface.RÉSUMÉ: Une approche a l'optimisation des outils de forage qui est basee sur une analyse de la dependance du forage coute sur la forme d'outil est presentee. L'effet de la forme d'outil sur la consommation d'energie dans le forage rotatoire et la vie de l'outil est ,etudie analytiquement. On montre que la partie principale d'energie de forage est consommee pas pour le deplacement de roche. mais plutot par la microfissuration, cisaillant et ecrasement de la roche dans la zone de la pression hydrostatique elevee sous la surface de contact.ZUSAMMENFASSUNG: Die sich auf der Analyse von der Abhangigkeit Kosten des Bohrens von der Konstruktion des Werkzeuges griindete Methode der Bohrwerkzeugsoptimierung, wird dargestellt. Der Einfluss- der Werkzeugskonstruktioo auf Energieverbrauch beim Drehbohren und auf die Lebensdauer des Werkzeuges wird theoretisch untersucht. Es wird gezeigt, dass das Hauptteil der Energie bei der Bohrung fuer Sherungen und die Zerkleinerung des Gesteins in der Zone der hochen Dreiaxigkeit unter dem Kontaktoberflache verbraucht wird.1 INTRODUCTIONThis paper seeks to develop an approach to the improvement of the efficiency of drilling which takes into account both the efficiency of rock removal and the tool reliability and is based on the analysis of the dependence of drilling costs of the tool Shape.Costs of drilling are determined to a large extent by the intensity of rock removal (which influences the labor and energy Costs in drilling) and lifetime of tool (which determines the tool expenses). The intensity of rock removal depends largely on the efficiency of the use of energy in rock fragmentation namely it depends on which part of the applied energy is consumed for the plastic deformation overcrushing of rock, etc., and which part is consumed just for the detachment of rock from the massif. The rock removal occurs as a result of the growth of large cracks under the rock/tool contact surface.Therefore, the ratio between the part of applied energy consumed for the formation of large cracks and the rest of drilling energy characterizes the efficiency of energy distribution in rock fragmentation. This ratio depends on the tool shape (sharpness), orientation (rake other angles of cutter) tool material properties. etc. Based on the consideration of the energy distribution in rock fragmentation and on the analysis of drilling cost we develop an approach to the improvement of the construction of drilling tools.2 DRILLING COST PER UNIT VOLUME OF REMOVED ROCK- A CRITERIUM OF OPTIMIZATION OF DRILLINGCost of drilling consists of three main components: labor, energy and tool costs. Cost of drilling per unit volume of removed rock can be determined by the following formula (Rossmanith et al, 1994. Sveshnikov & Mishnaevsky Jr 1988):(Equation in full paper)where C - cost of drilling per unit volume of removed rock cost of one hour of work of the drilling machine, t - time needed to remove a unit volume of rock. CA - energy price, A - energy required to remove a unit volume of rock tool price, T - lifetime of the tool at given conditions.The value C presents an evident and natural Criterium of optimization of the drilling efficiency.Consider this formula in detail. One may assume that the values Ct, CA and Cv are constant. The time t can be determined as follows:(Equation in full paper)3 ENERGY DISTRIBUTION IN ROCK FRAGMENTATION3.1 Mechanism of rock fragmentation under mechanical loadingRock fragmentation under mechanical loading includes typically the following stages (Mishnaevsky Jr 1998): surface deformation and then surface destruction of rock; formation of layer of destroyed and then crushed rock between tool and rock; formation of zone of inelastic deformation under Contact surface (zone of high hydrostatic pressure, which turns out then into zone of crushed rock) and formation of cone crack; destruction of the rock volume bounded by the cone crack formation of axial cracks; abrupt change in the direction of cone crack propagation or its branching which lead finally to the spalling out of some volume of rock.

AB  - ABSTRACTElectrochemical studies on the corrosion or anodic polarization of iron in nitrate-containing solutions have received scant attention until now compared to the extensive studies about iron/sulfate systems.1-7 The iron will dissolve rapidly in a dilute acid, but it will be passivated spontaneously when exposed to a concentrated nitric acid. Epelboin, et al.,6 believe that nitrate reduction plays an important role in the difference of the interface behavior. Uhlig and coworkers,8-10 Schwenk,11 Kolman, et al.,12 and Greene and Fontana13 investigated corrosion behavior of different stainless steels in solutions containing chloride and nitrate ions and found that nitrate ions can effectively inhibit pit initiation in halide solutions but stimulate pit growth when added to the solutions after pit initiation.13 Newman and Ajjawi's results14 have shown that nitrate ions have no inhibiting effect on active dissolution even if the metal salt solution in the pit is supersaturated; however, nitrate ions may pass through a salt film formed at higher potentials during diffusion-controlled dissolution, causing abrupt passivation of an electrode surface. Pitting corrosion is a form of local dissolution resulting in formation of cavities in passivated metals or alloys, and it does much greater damage to metal products than general corrosion. Smialowska has summed up five types of pitting and characterized the features of each type.15 However, relatively less attention has been paid to studies of the nitrate effect on the pitting of iron in acidic chloridecontaining solutions. There are fewer reports about how nitrates affect the general corrosion of iron in solutions with different pH values. In this paper, the influence of nitrate on iron corrosion was investigated, including general corrosion and pitting corrosion, under different conditions. The relations between the electrochemical oscillation behavior and susceptibility to pitting

AB  - Abstract The Polymer Injection Project on the Dalia field, one of the main fields of Block 17 in deep offshore Angola, is a world first for both surface and subsurface aspects. In depth integrated geosciences and architecture study culminated, in January 2009, in the start of polymer injection in one of the Dalia water injection wells. Dalia field is a high permeability sandstone reservoir (> 1 D on average) and contains a medium viscosity oil (1 to 11 cP under reservoir conditions). The key challenges of the project were to start polymer injection: - Very early in the field development since first oil was in Dec. 2006 - With much wider well spacing than in any other project, - Under high salinity conditions (>25g/l) - With the specific logistics of a remote deep offshore area. After a very positive single well injectivity test early in 2009, additional single well injectivity tests were performed end 2009 on three Dalia wells in various configurations. They demonstrated an injectivity of the polymer solution that satisfies the Field Development requirements in term of voidage replacement, as defined in the water injection base case. During this testing period, the capacity of the logistics and surface facilities (capacity of 7 t/day) to successfully prepare the polymer solution on board the FPSO have been demonstrated after specific difficulties and issues were identified and fixed. Based on these positive results, a Phase 1 project was sanctioned and started on 8th February 2010 on the Camelia complex. Viscosified water is injected in one of the four injection lines of Dalia field (average BSW of 20% on the associated producers at beginning of Phase 1 polymer injection). By mid June 2010, more than 3 MM bbls of cumulative of polymer solution have been injected in the Camelia reservoir. The specificities of the Dalia field (large well spacing and low BSW at polymer injection start up) mean a late response if the usual EOR monitoring techniques are applied. Various monitoring options were considered to verify the injected polymer solution properties in-situ, and accelerate the sanction for a fullfield development. The studies concluded on a recommendation to drill a well to sample in-situ the injected viscosified water. Locations of the sampler well at a distance of 100m from an injector, and best timing to drill the well were based on 4D seismic data history match and waterflood performance forecast. Introduction Deep offshore exploration has been very successful in Bloc 17 Angola. After a first discovery with Girassol in the Oligocene levels, Total operator discovered the Dalia field in 1997 in the Miocene levels containing more viscous oils (Figure 1).

AB  - AbstractIn October/1994 Petrobras, leading a team of six companies has installed for the first time in the world an ESP in a subsea well. The subsea ESP system in the well RJS-221, located in 86 meters water depth, in the Carapeba oilfield has completed in June/97, 32 months in operation without failures. The success with this installation has encouraged Petrobras to proceed with this project on a second Phase, in order to extend the application of this technology to 1150 meters water depth. This paper presents the developments achieved by Petrobras and the Companies associated, from the initial studies that led to the first subsea ESP installation, and the new efforts towards a deepwater installation in the well RJS-477, in 1107 meters water depth. East Albacora-oilfield. IntroductionThe oil in Brazil is mainly produced in the Campos Basin, offshore Rio de Janeiro State. In this area, giant reservoirs were discovered in deepwater and due to an increasing oil demand in the country are now the main scenario for the new investments.In order to produce from this Basin, Petrobras has over the years made use of fixed towers, having 13 installed (all of them in shallow waters up to 300 meters), but has strongly adopted floating production systems (FPS's), that receive the oil directly from satellite wells or through subsea manifolds. FPS's have allowed for a very important flexibility and particularly for anticipation of production. It is not necessary to mention the advantages of these two characteristics in offshore oilfield development. For deepwater, Petrobras has adopted the same system, based on semi-submersibles and mainly on oil tankers. These are now being converted to operate as FPSO's, at the same time that the increase in local oil production reduces the need for these carriers to import oil.These systems are based in subsea wells and some years ago, after having developed a pioneer template-manifold for deepwater. Petrobras has recognized in the Manifolds the same characteristics of the FPS's and adopted them.With Floating Vessels, flexible flowlines and control umbilicals, subsea wells/subsea trees, subsea manifolds, Petrobras have been progressing towards deepwater.But a limitation had always to be faced: the distance from the platform to the wells could not be increased without important losses. The exploitation lay-out was determined by the capability of reservoir pressures, that may be insufficient to produce over long distances. The alternatives were then to try, by one side, to reduce pressure decline by water injection, with limits of course, and on the other side, to reduce the backpressure with gas lift, the only artificial lift method available. Gas lift loses a lot of efficiency in long horizontal flowlines typical of subsea wells, as well as with the BSW increase and the results were that, as the reservoirs moved into deepwaters the FPS's so did.A new method was then required for oil production over long distances, specially from deepwater wells, allowing the platform to be placed in shallow waters, and for a reduction in the number of platforms, thus simplifying the production layout and reducing the investments.Within the PROCAP 2000 Program for deepwater technology development, a project was created by the end of 1992 in order to develop such a method.From the available alternatives, Petrobras selected the Electrical Submersible Pumps (ESP), utilized on and offshore, specially in the eight fixed towers of the North-east Pole of Campos Basin, where a total of a 132 wells have been producing with this method. ESP's presented characteristics to be a potential alternative to meet the enhanced requirements for the production of subsea wells. P. 451^

AB  - Members SPE-AIME AbstractInfill drilling, the drilling of additional wells on established spacing units, will increase a field's rate of recovery. In a low-permeability reservoir, where the sand quality of the producing formation varies greatly from wellbore to wellbore, infill drilling will also increase ultimate recovery. Two such low permeability reservoirs are the Blanco Mesaverde and Basin Dakota reservoirs in the San Juan basin of northwest New Mexico. Production rates and cumulative production of the infill wells developed so Production rates and cumulative production of the infill wells developed so far indicate that additional reserves are being developed on the established drillsites. This paper does not attempt to quantify the increase, but presents data which supports the basic conclusion that significant reserve increases can be developed in low permeability reservoirs by infill drilling. The Blanco Mesaverde reservoir was, for the most part, fully developed when the New Mexico Oil Conservation Commission approved infill drilling in late 1974. Since then, over 1,250 infill wells have been completed as of July 1982. Approximately 1,500 infill wells remain to be drilled. Many of the infill wells completed have higher initial producing rates than the original wells and also appear to have more recoverable reserves than anticipated. Pressure versus cumulative production curves which indicate that reserves are being increased, are presented for the total Blanco Mesaverde reservoir and for three townships and ranges which have been almost completely infilled. In addition, pressure versus cumulative production plots for two sets of original and infill wells, where the production plots for two sets of original and infill wells, where the infills have produced for seven years, are presented to show that the infill wells have not interfered with the original well. The Basin Dakota infill program was approved in May 1979 by the New Mexico Oil Conservation Commission. As of July 1982, over 750 infill wells had been completed. More than 2000 infill wells remain to be drilled. Since the Basin Dakota reservoir is much less permeable than the Blanco Mesaverde reservoir, this infill program is also expected to substantially increase recoverable reserves. Production rates and cumulative production of the infill wells as compared to their original wells indicate that additional reserves are also being developed in the Basin Dakota reservoir as a result of the infill drilling program. A brief description of the Blanco Mesaverde and Basin Dakota reservoirs and their development on 320-acre spacing is presented. Two Dakota wells in which long-term pressure build-up tests were run are presented to give evidence of the very low permeability in the reservoir. Production rates and cumulative production of three infill wells in different areas of the Basin Dakota field are compared with those of the original offset wells. These show that the original wells are not adequately draining the drillsite and additional reserves are being developed by the infill wells. P. 363

AB  - Abstract Angola's O&G business environment has shifted from Exploration to Production, and from Drilling to Well Intervention for obvious reasons of current and projected state of the E&P industry where operations are squeezed by volatile oil prices and higher operating costs. Operators in quest to maintain production plateau resolve in excessive choke increase. Therefore, a focus on predicting resulting HWcut and or HGor over time becomes significant as 75% of fields are under fluid injection for a balance voidage replacement. This study uses fields in Angola for conventional diagnostics decline curve analysis. Using plots of cumulative oil vs GOR, Pressure, Water cut and choke, to analyses the water and or gas production responses vs. oil cumulative to the excessive choke change. To have a complete sense of the impact, PI is included to consider oil production with respect to pressure drawdown. This study where mainly focused in clastic deposits. This approach may help anticipate the production of water due to excessive increase in choke sizes. It is expected that depending on the provenance of the water, it is concluded that excessive choke variation can be problematic in the future. A possible warning or alert is generated for any future choke change and hence oil production is optimized. An excel macro coding- PredOPT (Prediction and Optimization) is developed for the analysis and plugged-in to commercial software for the ease of applicability.

AB  - The experience gained in a unique in situ combustion (ISC) pilot project, in the heavy oil (13° API), water drive Quifa field in Colombia, is presented. The design, construction and operation of the production and air compression facilities are discussed. Under normal conditions, the water cut (BSW) in Quifa is above 90% and the ultimate primary recovery is less than 14%, which imposes strong design and operational challenges for an ISC project. The pilot project was operated from Nov 2011 to July 2014. A modified inverted-nine spot pattern was used, with all wells instrumented with pressure and temperature devices, as well as the majority of the surface equipment. Real-time monitoring and visualization was developed for proper surveillance of the pilot operation. This paper emphasizes about the surface facilities designed and selected to obtain the best performance of the process in the pilot. Since this was the first time that an ISC project was carried out in Colombia, there was no previous field performance data available about the quality of the produced fluids under ISC, so the main design data for the project were based on combustion tube tests performed for the Quifa field, and data from different projects worldwide available on technical literature. The design and operation of the surface facilities considered the effect of ISC on the mechanical integrity of the installations and the environment, with the implementation of the adequate piping class specification and HSE practices to comply with local and international standards due to the presence of H2S and acid water. Early detection systems were installed, which helped to operate the pilot within regulations and strict safety conditions. With this pilot project Pacific Rubiales Energy has built a valuable learning curve in the design, construction and management of an ISC processes, obtaining a unique experience for future projects of its kind. It should be noted that the implementation of EOR projects of this type constitutes a significant contribution in understanding the relation between subsurface and surface process under In Situ Combustion Process to the future of the exploitation of heavy oil fields.

AB  - AbstractUnderground cavities are normally discovered in the North-Eastern part of South Korea, where the karst region spreads. This particular condition can create geotechnical hazard such as abrupt displacement, long-term settlement, cavity collapse, etc. In this research, a road embankment on the karst region is selected and analysed using Distinct Element Method (DEM) and Finite Different Method (FDM). In the DEM analysis, soil and rock mass are simulated using assemblies of circular balls. Porosity and particle-size distribution are also considered for evaluating the initial stress condition. In this study, it is focused on the estimate of elastic properties of specimen for FDM analysis based on case study using DEM analysis. A few numerical triaxial tests according to confining pressure have been performed and loading-unloading procedure is also simulated to determine Young’s modulus and Poission’s ratio. These properties are applied to FDM analysis of actual embankment section and compared with DEM analysis results.

AB  - Abstract Sand production in oil and gas wells is a complex problem that requires a multidisciplinary analysis to arrive at an optimal solution of the problem and thus increases the productivity of oil fields with problems of production of sand. Many operators choose as first alternative, the exclusion of sand, avoiding doing a risk management, which ultimately provides lower index of productivity and in many cases convert the wells with sand problems in unproductive wells. Therefore always be a better option the sand management and take as a last option the sand exclusion, obviously framed within a technical and economic evaluation of alternatives. In most cases when we refer to a chemical treatment for sand control, it tends to confuse with chemical consolidation treatments, however a different option, is the application of chemical treatments to modify the zeta potential of the formation fines that has been very successful. Modifying The zeta potential to optimum range, provides a strengthened attraction between the particles to optimally align proppant type, sand particles, fines, etc., allowing the formation of conglomerates of proppant, sand, fines, etc., improving conductivity and control of fines migration. This study focused on the evaluation in the laboratory of chemical treatment (compatibility, zeta potential and rock-fluid testing, etc.), mineralogical and granulometric analysis of sand and fines produced by wells with sanding problems, selection of wells and treatment zones, quantification of costs associated with sanding problems, technical and economic evaluation of the application of treatments in candidate wells, etc. This paper presents the results of the laboratory evaluation of chemical treatment (satisfactory results in compatibility and modification of the zeta potential, permeability returns of over 80%, etc.) and implementation in the well Bonanza 39, located in the Basin of the Middle Magdalena Valley in Colombia, where dropped dramatically the frequency of interventions by sanding problems. Before chemical treatment, the well had a monthly intervention and after nine months of the treatment, has not required intervention, allowing increase productivity of the well. Finally, the main findings, conclusions and recommendations obtained in this study are shown.

AB  - ABSTRACT Scattering and trapping of the higher order free long waves over a submerged step are investigated. As incident waves, two wave components with slightly different frequencies and obliquely incident angles to the step are considered. The forced waves and the free long waves are obtained up to the second order of the perturbation method. Applicability of these solutions are investigated. It is found that depending on the wave and the step conditions, the free long waves of the progressive mode can not exist in the deeper region but can exist in the shallower region. INTRODUCTION When the short waves propagate over an uneven bottom, nonlinear effects generate higher order harmonics of free waves, which are radiated from the region of abrupt change of the depth. Massel(1983) analyzed these nonlinear effects on a submerged step using a perturbation method and showed the mechanism of generation of the higher order free waves on the second order expansion. Agnon and Mei(1988) studied a similar problem where groups of short waves are incident on a shelf and showed that free long waves are generated and trapped on the shelf. Massel''s analysis is restricted on two-dimensional problem with one component of incident waves. Agnon and Mei extended to threedimensional problem with groups of short waves as the incident waves. But they ignored the contributions from evanescent modes of the linear waves to the forcing function for the long waves in their multiple- scale method. The basic mechanism of generation of the higher order free waves is that the forced waves have discontinuity across the abrupt change of the depth and the higher order free waves are generated to compensate this discontinuity.

AB  - Summary The polymer injection project on the Dalia field, one of the main fields of Block 17 in deep offshore Angola, is a world first in both surface and subsurface aspects. An in-depth integrated geosciences and architecture study culminated, in January 2009, in the start of polymer injection in one of the Dalia water-injection wells. The Dalia field is a high-permeability sandstone reservoir (> 1 D on average) and contains a medium-viscosity oil (1 to 11 cp under reservoir conditions). The key challenges of the project were to start polymer injection Very early in the field development (first oil was in December 2006) With much wider well spacing than in any other project Under high-salinity conditions (>25 g/L) With the specific logistics of a remote deep offshore area A phased approach has been retained in order to progressively derisk the project, starting from a single-well, short-duration injectivity test, followed by a full line injection in the three injectors of one of the reservoirs, and hopefully concluding with an injection extension. A single-well, short-duration injectivity test was successfully implemented in the first quarter of 2009. The Phase 1 project started on 8 February 2010 in the Camelia reservoir. Viscosified water was injected into one of the four injection lines of the Dalia field (average BSW) of 20% on the associated producers at beginning of Phase 1 polymer injection]. By December 2011, more than 5 million bbl of cumulative of polymer solution has been injected in the Camelia reservoir. The specificities of the Dalia field (large well spacing and low BSW at polymer-injection startup) mean a late response if the usual EOR monitoring techniques are applied. Various monitoring options were considered to verify the injected-polymer-solution properties in situ, and to accelerate the sanction for a full-field development. The studies concluded with a recommendation to drill a well to sample in situ the injected viscosified water. Location of the sampler well at a distance of 100 m from an injector, and the best timing to drill the well, were based on a 4D-seismic-data history match and waterflood-performance forecast.

AB  - Abstract The Fahud field, on stream since 1967, is being the largest field in Oman in term of STOIIP 1×10(9) m3. This great carbonate field, initially produced by natural depletion, followed by gas injection in 1968, water flooding drive in 1972 and is now being produced by gas- oil gravity drainage process (GOGD) since 1984. The field once thought to be completely covered with fractured reservoir, hence only GOGD development with crestal gas injection for voidage replacement has recently being also developed by water flooding in Shuiaba and Natih matrix reservoir.The dual lateral completion aims to maximize the productivity from relatively low permeability matrix units. The two laterals are normally completed barefoot (Level 2 multilateral) with a single selective 3 1/2" gas lift completion. As completion stays simple and cost effective, lateral re-entry remains one of the main challenge. Different technologies have been applied to address various completion challenges in these dual laterals, with various degrees of success. For instance a pre-milled secure window at the junction to allow upper lateral re-entry has been applied with technical success but hindered 7" liner cementation. Other areas that have been atried in dual laterals are improving acid stimulation techniques, lifting optimization, improving well design to overcome hole problem, improve liner cementation, producing and monitoring each lateral, etc. at different degrees of success.This paper is intended to cover all these major challenges facing Fahud horizontal dual lateral wells matrix reservoirs, technologies applied and their outcomes (success and failures), and foreseen future completion issues in term of subsurface characteristics uncertainties and way forward. Given such a large STOOIP, and the fact that GOGD process has slow and low recovery factor, maximizing these low permeability matrix units is essential for the field production.IntroductionHorizontal wells in Fahud have in general been drilled in low offtake areas and at the same time replace gassed out vertical wells. Drilling of horizontal wells was started with short radius wells, drilled in 1984 and 1986. Drilling of horizontal wells was stopped in the period between 1986 and 1991. About 10 new horizontal wells were drilled between 1991 and 1995. Sidetracking from existing wells was started in 1995 and slimhole wells design was started in 1997, resulting in significant cost savings. A total of 80 horizontal wells have been drilled till the time of writing this paper (Fig. 1). These wells are distributed across the field and completed over various reservoirs in the field. Horizontal wells are contributing more than 80% of the total field production. Development Types The field is being produced under two developments, gas/oil gravity drainage (GOGD) process with gas injection and matrix development with water injection. Under the GOGD process, oil-filled rock matrix is surrounded by gas bearing fractures. The density difference between the oil and the gas encourages oil to drain by gravity from the low permeability matrix into the fracture system, where it gathers in a fracture oil rim from where it is produced (Fig. 2). The voidage created in the matrix pore space is replaced by gas, which is injected into the fracture system (Ref. 3). Generally GOGD wells come on stream with low nett production, high BSW and low GOR. Nett production increases with a reduction in water cut as the fracture oil rim is pulled down to the well completion. After a peak oil production period, the GOR starts to increase (Ref. 2).

AB  - This article, written by Special Publications Editor Adam Wilson, contains highlights of paper SPE 185546, “Importance of the Study of Environmental Aspects in the Exploitation of Unconventional Reservoirs for Risk Assessment of the Activity in Argentina,” by M.A. De La Zerda and E. Erdmann, SPE, Instituto Tecnológico de Buenos Aires, and R. Sarandón, Universidad Nacional de La Plata, prepared for the 2017 SPE Latin America and Caribbean Petroleum Engineering Conference, Buenos Aires, 17–19 May. The paper has not been peer reviewed. This paper presents an analysis of the environmental aspects of the exploitation of unconventional reservoirs in order to evaluate the risk of the activity. To this end, the existing normative framework, the natural and socioeconomic conditions of the area, and the applicable technologies are considered. The novelty of this work is the analysis of the factors that determine the environmental risk including technologies, environmental conditions at the site, and the legal context in the region. Methodology A review and comparative analysis was performed of the general and environmental regulatory framework in Argentina where unconventional exploration or exploitation activities are carried out. This analysis was completed with a review of the effluent-management strategy, comparing it with criteria used by other countries, especially the United States. In order to perform a preliminary evaluation of the environmental risk, a structured, conceptual, and qualitative analysis was conducted in specific sectors corresponding to each of the areas of exploration and exploitation. Depending on the information available at the regional level, and based on the analysis of satellite images, each site was characterized according to 20 parameters. Parameters 1–9 represented the natural physical environment, 10–13 represented biotic or ecological factors, and 14–20 represented human environment: Temperature—Low temperatures result in a longer time for recovery; biochemical processes are slower. Extreme temperatures result in operational technological challenges. Precipitation—High levels of precipitation make the land less stable, raising the risk of water erosion, landslides, torrential phenomena, floods, and other extreme events. Contour—Abrupt land contour changes increase the risk of erosion, landslide, or mass removal. Wind—Frequent and intense winds increase the dispersion of atmospheric pollutants, especially particulate matter, and can lead to potential contamination of populated or productive areas. Water Depth—Deeper groundwater increases the risk of contamination by intentional or accidental spills, as well as contact with hazardous substances. Wetlands—The proximity to wetlands (e.g., streams, rivers, lakes, and ponds) increases the risk of contamination by intentional or accidental spill. Water Resources—The availability of water resources affects hydraulic-fracturing operations. Land Quality—High-quality land results in greater risk to the environment from an accidental spill or degradation from occupation, erosion, or contamination. Hydrologic Regime—Increased intermittence of the watercourse increases the risk of torrential activity, erosion, and flooding, raising the risk of accidents during the operation phase.

AB  - ABSTRACTThe term "pore collapse" is used to describe a drastic, irreversible reduction in porosity due to the increase in effective stress on the rock matrix as a consequence of withdrawal of oil and gas. This paper describes an elastoplastic constitutive model that incorporates the phenomenon of pore collapse, and its numerical implementation in a nonlinear finite element (FE) code. Preliminary evaluation of results from the FE simulation indicate that the uniaxial strain conditions, which are predominant in producing reservoir rock strata, can be idealized fairly well by the constitutive model and the numerical simulator. Application of this numerical simulator to a compacting reservoir is currently being pursued and the results will be presented in the future.INTRODUCTIONProduction of fluids from a hydrocarbon reservoir results in the decline of pore pressure and an increase in effective stress. Under such conditions, certain porous rocks experience a sudden increase in compressibility. This increase, coupled with the accompanied irreversible deformation, is often termed as "pore collapse" [Sinits et al., 1988; Addis, 1987]. This phenomenon often leads to an abrupt compaction of reservoir rocks accompanied by the subsidence of the ground surface [Christensen et al., 1989] and a decrease in production [Marek, 1979; Simon et al., 1982]. Well-known examples of pore-collapse-induced subsidence include the Ekofisk and Valhall fields in the North Sea, the Wilmington field in California, the Bolivar Coast and the Lagunillas fields in Venezuela, the South Belrige fields of San Joaquin Valley in California, and the Wairakai Geothermal Project in New Zealand to name a few [Christensen et al., 1989; van Ditzhuijzen and de Waal, 1984; Smits et al., 1988]. Also, the phenomenon has been observed by several investigators under laboratory conditions [Johnson et al, 1989].Reservoir compaction can have detrimental as well as salubrious effects [Abou Sayed, 1982; Sulak and Danielsen, 1989]. The pore collapse in reservoir rocks may lead to a reduction in permeability [MareL 1979]. In addition, transformation of rock into sand may result from compaction, destruction of the skeleton microstructure, and/or crushing of grains. Such loose particles may then start to migrate toward the well, leading to serious "sanding" problems. Severe compaction may also affect wellbore stability. In some cases, pore collapse may lead to macroscopic shear fractures in the reservoir matrix, thereby increasing the flow of hydrocarbons.

AB  - Abstract Rotating drill pipe passing through dog-legs suffers fatigue damage due to cyclic bending stresses. Curves of the cumulative fatigue damage incurred in either steel or aluminum drill pipe going through such dog-legs are presented. These curves provide means for properly planning the rate of angle build-up in directionally drilled wells and allow discarding of drill pipe which has been fatigue-damaged in dog-legs. Introduction Drill pipe which is subjected to bending as it rotates, experiences a cyclically varying bending stress. If this bending stress is sufficiently large, the drill pipe is fatigue-damaged by each revolution, and ages as fatigue damage accumulates. Drill pipe can be bent intentionally, as in the case of directionally drilled holes, or unintentionally due to undesired changes in hole direction caused by variations in formation properties, weight on bit, etc. These changes in hole direction, whether intentional or unintentional, are called dog-legs. The theoretical limits of dog-legs which are permissible before the drill pipe begins to fatigue can be calculated. However, in wells where the maximum permissible dog-leg is exceeded, the concept of cumulative fatigue damage can be used to estimate damage suffered by the drill pipe. This concept has already been used to estimate the cumulative fatigue damage of drill pipe due to drilling vessel roll. The purpose of this paper is to extend the usage of the cumulative fatigue damage concept to drill pipe in dog-legs, and to draw conclusions which may be beneficial in preventing numerous frustrating and expensive drill pipe failures. FATIGUE OF STEEL DRILL PIPE IN IDEALIZED GRADUAL AND LONG DOG-LEGS It is taken for granted that, if necessary, the reader will become familiar with the definitions and concepts which follow by examining the reference cited in each case. For Ref. 1, it will suffice to read only through the section Abrupt Dog-Legs. 1. Concept of the two extreme kinds of idealized dog-legs: gradual and long dog-legs and abrupt dog-legs, 2. Concept of why the bending moment in drill pipe under tension is the largest in the vicinity of the tool joint, 3. Concept of why dog-leg severity which drill pipe can withstand decreases with an increase in tension, and 4. Definition of the rate of change of over-all hole angle (dog-leg severity). Figs. 1 and 2 indicate the aging (fraction of life expended) of steel drill pipe passing through a gradual and long dog-leg. Both figures have a left-hand ordinate scale labled Length of Drill Pipe Below Dog-Legs. This scale can be used for cases in which the drill collar weight is applied to the bit and does not contribute to the tension in the drill pipe. It can be used for either 3 1/2-, 4 1/2- or 5-in. drill pipe. This is due to the fact that, if the drill collars do not contribute to the drill pipe tension, then the effect of pipe tension on bending due to a change in pipe size is nearly compensated for by a corresponding change in pipe rigidity. On the other hand, if drill pipe is rotated off bottom, then drill collars contribute to the tension in the drill pipe and this increase in tension is not compensated for. In this case, one of the three right-hand ordinates must be used (the one which corresponds to the correct drill pipe size). In the right-hand ordinates, tension should be understood as the weight in mud of the portion of the drilling string below the dog-leg, minus the weight on bit. JPT P. 359^

AB  - ABSTRACT:In recent rock mechanics studies, more attention is being focused on the behaviour of rocks under varying straining conditions, as it is a vital factor in the design of rock structures as well as various mining operations like drilling, blasting and crushing. Many researchers have been investigating into the effects of strain rate on strength, Young's modulus, ultimate strain and also the failure behaviour of the rocks. However, conflicting results have been obtained by various investigators. An investigation, therefore, was carried out by the authors to study the effect of strain rate on mechanical behaviour of some Indian rocks. A third degree polynomial has been found to give the best fit to the plot between ultimate strength and strain rate, and Young's modulus and strain rate of rock samples. The failure strength was found to increase with increase in strain rate and an abrupt increase was observed at strain rates of 10 ¹/sec and 10 ²/sec. The Young's modulus also increased with increase in strain rate. However, the ultimate strain was found to be independent of the strain rate. 1 INTRODUCTIONThe study of the mechanical behaviour of rocks deformed at various strain rates is very useful in the engineering problems of rock excavation. To optimize the two principal operations, drilling and blasting, a detailed knowledge of the mechanical properties and fracture characteristics of the rock material is needed as reported by Blanton (1981) and Chong et al (1980a, 1980b). The two variables that are of particular interest to the concerned engineer are the time involved and the energy consumed in fragmenting the rock. In drilling operations, if the failure stress of rock increases with increase in strain rate, then drilling techniques involving higher strain rates will consume more energy in removing a given amount of rock. In this case, these additional energy requirements at the higher strain rates may not be offset by the advantage gained, i.e. the saved time. If, on the other hand, the rock becomes more brittle at higher strain rates, then with the drilling techniques involving higher strain rates the energy required to remove a given amount of rock will be lower. This is so because, a more brittle rock would end to fragment at a lower strain, and the combination of relatively constant stress with decreasing failure strain at higher strain rates enables the energy necessary to break the rock to be lowered at higher strain rates. In this case, a high deformation rate would be advantageous from the point of view of both excavation rate and energy consumption. In blasting operation, fragmentation sizes and permeability extensions are strongly related to strain rates of loading. In regions of low strain rates, fragment sizes are large and cracks propagate to larger distances, whereas, in regions of high strain rates, fragment sizes are small and cracks are localized. An optimal fragmentation can be achieved at intermediate strain rates of 10° to 10² per second.

AB  - Abstract Castilla field, located 250 km southeast of Bogota, Colombia, was discovered in 1969 by Chevron Oil Company and was originally developed with vertical wells. The 10,300 acre field produces heavy oil from the Guadalupe reservoir (Upper Cretaceous), which has a strong bottom aquifer water drive. Ecopetrol acquired the field in late 2000 and completed the first horizontal well in February 2001. In early 2005, a second drilling campaign was started with directional wells using a 7-well cluster design to increase reservoir exposure and to delay the effect of the aquifer water influx. In 2006, a multidisciplinary team was formed to evaluate the feasibility of advanced well architecture to increase oil sweep efficiency, avoid bypassed oil in the K2 reservoir resulting from coning, and minimize water production. Based on reservoir and drilling analysis, the study recommended drilling three TAML Level 4 multilateral wells to replace nine directional wells originally projected in two different areas of the field. The result has been increased reservoir exposure in K1 and K2, reduced drawdown pressure to produce the K2 reservoir, important reduction in water production (BSW), and higher estimated final oil recovery per well. This paper presents the lessons learned from drilling and completing these three multilateral wells to illustrate the challenges and benefits of using multilateral technology for Castilla field. National Colombian Petroleum Company (Ecopetrol) is evaluating various technologies to increase production and to improve recovery factors in their mature oil and gas fields. As part of that process, a multidisciplinary team evaluated the feasibility of multilateral well technology implementation in some of their mature fields that are currently in the late-development phase. Castilla field, located in the eastern planes of Colombia, was selected as the first option for multilateral technology implementation, based on reservoir features, type of oil, and field antecedents. This paper presents the process used to conceptualize the optimum multilateral well design for Castilla field, integrating all of the geological and engineering disciplines. The disciplines and their areas of focus include the following: Geology - Geological model visualization, target zones definition, pay zones lateral continuity, petrophysical properties, and fluids distribution were evaluated to select the areas to drill with advanced architecture well design. Reservoir - Basic reservoir performance simulation was performed to evaluate productivity with horizontal and multilateral wells, and the difference in final reserves recovery was compared to current conventional directional wells. Water production and coning problems were identified as key factors to define the multilateral well implementation in this field. Drilling - Trajectory design, multilateral junction depth definition and TAML level selection, casing point definition, drilling time, and authority for expenditure (AFE) estimation were the technical aspects evaluated during the planning phase to determine whether or not the technology would be feasible. A comparison with conventional pad design was conducted to validate economic value. Multilateral TAML level 4 system selection flow process is presented applying oil industry best practices. Completion - The optimum lateral completion and production assembly design were main concerns during the planning process. Slotted liners, screens, and open-hole completion options for the horizontal section were evaluated. Intelligent completion designs were analyzed for several multilateral well configurations, and the best alternative was selected to accomplish the production optimization goals. During the operation phase, the geological and geophysical (G&G) and drilling teams worked together to implement a dynamic, real-time optimization process to control positioning of the horizontal wellbores using geosteering techniques. The pay zone completion was based on the quality of rock found while drilling the horizontal sections using real-time information from the logging-while-drilling (LWD) tools. In addition to multilaterals, the introduction of rotary steerable tools and LWD tools were important new technologies for the Castilla field. This paper presents the effect of these tools on the total well cost because rate of penetration (ROP) optimization is yet another important milestone achieved with this project.

AB  - Abstract Traditionally, service companies have had to place several consecutive cement plugs to successfully kick off wells deeper than 3,500 meters. Within the scope of integrated projects in Southern Mexico where wells are usually deeper than 5,000 meters, the low success rate for traditional balanced plug cementing has jeopardized operational efficiency and financial results. Several plug failures made it clear that the volumetric calculations and other known engineering best practices that were implemented were not sufficient to bring the success rate to an acceptable level. In our field study, we implemented an innovative simulation and design method that allows for engineered optimization of the plug placement design and that shows how a 100% success rate in plug cementing can be achieved in wells as deep as 5,720 meters, with hard formations and an OBM environment. The value of this new method resides in a live analysis and display of the fluid interfaces, mixing both while traveling down the pipe and up the annulus and resulting in the output of an estimated top of uncontaminated cement after pulling the pipe out of the hole. The new workflow reveals the effect of each variable affecting the amount of contamination of the cement slurry downhole and gives the engineer the opportunity to optimize the plug placement design before job execution to reach the highest possible top of uncontaminated cement after execution. The results obtained with the new engineering tool and a precise operational field execution has moved the theory of plug placement from the best practice library to the reality of the plug placement operations. Introduction In deep exploration wells in Southern Mexico, it is not uncommon to set one or more sidetrack cement plugs because of the complexity of the lithology. Successfully placing each plug usually involves more than one attempt and takes an average of 8 to 10 days of rig time. Because of repeated failure in the hard-fractured and microfracture formations found at depths up to 7,500 meters, a compromise is often required between the compressive strength of the cement and the density of the cement to avoid lost circulation. El Hassan, et al. (2006) describe why, in sidetrack plugging, the rate of penetration (ROP) in the cement must be less than that of the formation to effectively kick off the well. Hence, the difference between the compressive strength of the set cement and the surrounding formation must be minimized (El Hassan, et al., 2006) to obtain a smaller difference in the comparative rate of penetration (LaPrade and Low, 2003; Babasheikh, et al., 2003) under the same drilling parameters. Since, to a large degree, compressive strength determines the success of kicking off from cement, it is extremely important for the set cement properties to be as close as possible to the laboratory design. This requires keeping the cement slurry uncontaminated during placement since any noncementitious fluids—such as oil based drilling mud—will have a detrimental effect on the hydration of the cement slurry, increasing thickening times and decreasing the final compressive strength. Historically, even the most sophisticated mathematical models used to simulate cement slurry placement assume that uncontaminated fluids are exiting the end of the pipe, and pumped fluids are interacting with the fluids in the wellbore only after they are displaced into the annulus. To compensate for that assumption, engineers optimized the placement based on previous field successes or failures, which were rarely successful if applied under different conditions.

AB  - Crolet, Jean-Louis; SNEA (P) Abstract The problems of acid corrosion in the wells are in a perpetual evolution. For CO2 corrosion, the solution of using 13% Cr production tubings seems to have rapidly expanded, production tubings seems to have rapidly expanded, and a quick summary of our own experience is given. The difficulty lies essentially in accurately forecasting when stainless steel will be necessary and when the CO2 corrosion of standard tubings will remain acceptable. For H2S corrosion, the differences between the traditional SSC problems and the new SCC ones are emphasized. Introduction In the oil and gas industry the increasing cost of energy since 1973 has basically modified the terms and the solutions of corrosion problems. In particular, it is now very unlikely for a well to be closed merely because of the effluent corrosivity. Indeed practically all the available means to fight internal corrosion have reached their threshold of economic profitability. The only remaining question is to choose the most suitable one and to ensure that it is a technological success. Furthermore, the increasing cost of energy has also resulted in a spectacular development of offshore production. Thus, increased safety requirements and the enormity of investments lead to an ever growing need for prevision, as accurately as possible, of the corrosion behavior of the plants. Simultaneously, the trend towards the reduction of offshore personnel, and then of the monitoring, which is inherent in techniques of inhibition, strongly supports the production engineers in their wish to solve corrosion problems in wells by using corrosion resistant materials alone. Naturally, the choice of materials for tubings and casings is the most important aspect of this evolution. The aim of this paper is thus to take stock of the present technology and of expected evolution concerning the two main corrosion problems in the wells, namely: - CO2 corrosion, that is the problems of metal dissolution and of tubing break through in H2S free, CO2 fields. - H2S corrosion, that is the problem of sudden cracking of the tubings and casings in H2S fields. 2. CO2 CORROSION 2.1. General CO2 corrosion in the wells was first reported in the 1940's, in Louisiana and Texas. At the present time it is also encountered in the Netherlands present time it is also encountered in the Netherlands and Germany, in the North Sea, in the Gulf of Guinea, and in California. CO2 corrosion concerns both gas wells and oil wells. Its extent depends indeed upon the action of a very large body of parameters (temperature, pressure, CO2 content, BSW, water analysis, flow conditions etc). In this respect, the best published studies still remain the ones carried out in the United States by the NACE around 1950. Beyond the diversity of facies and of environmental conditions, the CO2 corrosion of steels is basically a very localised corrosion which appears in the form of pits, gutters or attacked areas of various sizes. Where the localised attack occurs, the penetration rate of the corrosion is quite high, reaching very commonly several mm/year. Normally, apart from these affected areas, the dissolution rate remains rather limited. The transition from an affected to an unaffected area is most often very abrupt. It is very difficult to gauge the amount of CO2 corrosion in advance, since there are numerous exceptions to the usual rule: "No noticeable corrosion for CO2 partial pressure up to 0.05 MPa, severe corrosion over 0.2 MPa". So, to summarize, the two main concerns at this time are actually the forecasting of the corrosion of standard tubings and the use of stainless steel tubings. P. 375

AB  - Abstract The exploration and production of heavy oil often results in the formation of tight water in oil and oil in water emulsions that are stabilized further by the presence of paraffin, asphaltene, scale, corrosion inhibitors and other fine solids. This emulsion in its most stable form can be very difficult to break and often requires more than gravity separation and treatment with emulsion breakers. It is a well-established practice in the oilfield to utilize heater treaters in combination with emulsion breaker chemicals to treat slop oil. However some emulsions are so stable due to the presence of fine solids that they cannot be broken without the use of additional heat and centrifugal forces. This paper looks at a case study of the use of a process skid that utilized heat and two centrifuges: to treat stored slop oil that could not be separated to give saleable crude quality of <2%BSW. The stored slop oil was tested in the laboratory to ascertain the impact of emulsion breakers, heat and a combination of both emulsion breakers and heat. However none of these solutions by themselves were found to be successful. The process skid utilizing heat and two centrifuges was successful in application in the field and stored slop oil was treated at a range of 600-800 bpd with an average rate of recovery of 42% saleable crude being achieved. This paper describes the process skid utilized and the challenges encountered in its operation and maintenance. It outlines the lessons learnt and the steps that were taken to optimize its usage to get the best rate of recovery of saleable crude in the shortest time possible.

AB  - Abstract Mengkapan is a mature offshore oil field in the Malacca Strait PSC, located in central Sumatra, Indonesia. First oil flowed in 1986.  The production wells produce multiple sands commingled with simple ESP completions. Cumulative oil production at the end of 2010 was 35 MMSTB, and the current recovery factor is around 50%. Over the years, as oil rates declined and water cuts increased, the team ran production log campaigns to monitor the oil rate and water cut of sand.  These logs revealed the occurrence of cross-flow and oil-blocking, which was attributed to differences in permeability and pressure between the sands. The log results led to workovers to isolate high water-cut sands by setting production packers. But after more years passed, the point was reached where there were no more zones to isolate with packers, and the team was forced to consider well abandonment.  Rather than abandonment, the team changed their mindset from "there is no remaining oil" to "there is by-passed oil and we can get it".  The chosen technique was to squeeze-cement high water-cut zones and re-perforate by-passed oil sands identified from cased-hole logs.    In ME-02, massive cross-flow between high-permeability sands seen in the production logs did not matter, because the suspected by-passed oil sands were the lower permeability sands at the top of the perforated intervals which were unaffected by cross-flow.  The Carbon-Oxygen log suggested by-passed oil in the upper part of some sands. Next, all perforated intervals were squeeze-cemented, using a technique fine-tuned with the team's knowledge of cross-flow.  Then, the by-passed oil zones were re-perforated, and the well was completed and put on-line.  Prior to squeeze cementing and re-perforation, ME-02 well produced 9000 BFPD, 45 BOPD. After the workover, the well produced 2000 BFPD, 104 BOPD. The budget was USD 660,644.00, but only 60% of the budget was used. It paid out in two months.  This paper tells the failures by relying on a single tool and the success story in ME-02 to increase the value of a workover (reduced operation cost and increased oil gain), including the concept, the data gathering, and the field operation.  Introduction Mengkapan is an offshore field with two wellhead platforms called Delta (5 wells) and Echo (5 wells).  The Mengkapan wells produce from the Upper Sihapas (US) and Lower Sihapas (LS) Formations.  The Lower Sihapas Formation is more productive than the Upper Sihapas Formation.  The seven sand reservoirs in the Lower Sihapas Formation are named G10xx to G60xx.  Figure 1 shows the sands are separated by shale layers that can be correlated across the field. Table 1 show the oil is undersaturated and light.  All the Mengkapan wells produce multiple sands commingled with a simple ESP completion. High water cuts are experienced due to the large regional aquifer, high aquifer permeability, a water/oil mobility ratio above 1 an potentially from casing leakage and/or channeling behind casing. Oil recovery is compromised by the commingled production, due to the different reservoir pressures and deliverabilities.  Production logs revealed that flowing bottom-hole pressures are sometimes higher than the lowest reservoir pressure, so cross-flow will occur even when the well is flowing.

AB  - AbstractThis paper presents a study in wear tests with a gneiss from Santo Antônio de Pádua/RJ/BR and includes analysis of the rotation increase by testing Slake Durability (SD) and Micro-Deval (MD) tests. To evaluate the influence of the rotation in these tests was set up laboratory equipment that allows varying the speed of 7 rpm to 238 rpm. This study could be implemented in wide variety of rock materials and thus target it according to their lifetime in the project. With varying the wear levels it was observed increasing weight loss until the inertia moment holding the specimens in the wall of the machine. The results indicate an increase in linear mass loss. These procedures allow a more precise analysis of durability at a range approximately from various regions of the world.Introduction The civil engineering studies to evaluate of the durability characteristics in rock materials are common to use wear tests. In these test there is a relationship between the rotation speed of the degradation drum and the material durability characteristics. The determination of this relationship is fundamental for characterization a material in the long term, considering that the rotation speed is related to the energy of environmental degradation. Among the existing building materials, highlight particular deserve the rocks by the frequent use in the projects. According to Salles & Maia (2004), these materials before they are extracted from mines or quarries, it presents in a balanced alteration state with the environment, which was achieved in a geological time-interval, that is, from hundreds to thousands of years. After extraction and application in a work, change occurs in the middle. Then, the rock begins to undergo transformations seeking a new equilibrium condition. The speed of change in the new environment depends on the rock susceptibility to alteration, in the others words, the alterability. Thus, the rock alterability will depend on the material characteristics, the external environment and the exposure time. Depending on the alterability characteristics, the rock can change it in an interval of time that can vary from thousands of years to a few months. This paper presents the wear results of gray gneiss, from an ornamental stone extraction region in Santo Antônio de Padua, which is a Brazilian city that is located in the Northwest of the Rio de Janeiro state (Fig. 1).

AB  - ABSTRACTIn this paper, a full-scale field vertical loading test of cast-in-place bored piles was reproduced through an elasto-plastic finite element analysis. The applicability of the numerical analysis was confirmed through a comparison between analytical and measured results. A series of numerical analyses, in which the pile diameter was chosen as a variable, was carried out in order to investigate the effect of pile diameter on bearing resistance of cast-in-place bored pile. Through the analyses, the mechanical characteristics of skin friction around pile shaft and base bearing resistance at pile tip were elucidated. INTRODUCTIONGenerally speaking, the reason for the difficulty is that the bearing resistance and settlement curves that obtained at pile top does not indicate an abrupt change throughout loading tests, it is very difficult to determine yield loads or ultimate bearing loads from the bearing resistance and settlement curves as obtained from a field test. Therefore, their bearing resistance is often determined by a certain settlement at pile top or settlement normalized by pile diameter. The bearing resistance of piles is composed of both skin friction around pile shaft and base bearing resistance at pile tip. It is important, therefore, to elucidate each behavior as developed with the increase of the pile settlement, and hence to establish a reasonable design method for the cast-in-place bored piles. In this paper, the characteristics of both skin friction and base bearing resistances of case-in-place bored piles are discussed through a series of numerical analyses, in which the pile diameter is chosen as a variable. Firstly, results of full-scale field vertical loading test of a casein- place bored pile are reproduced by the numerical analysis. The analysis employs an elasto-plastic finite element method and the applicability of the numerical analysis was examined by comparing the analytical and measured results.

AB  - AbstractIn order to explore the change of biogenic Ba content in Pacific Ferromanganese crusts and their relationship with paleoproductivity fluctuations, a thick crust CHA99 from the Magellan Seamounts (MST) has been approached in detail. Studies show the variations of Babio(Ba/Al ) , AR Babio (Ba/Al) , and Ba/Al ratio, which are related to the biogeochemical processes, are found to exhibit similar rhythmical evolution trend and the variations of Ni, Zn, Cu and Mo content exhibit the same rhythmical change since 60Ma. Studies find that Babio(Ba/Al ), AR Babio(Ba/Al ), and Ba/Al ratio exhibit undulate change from begin until almost the lowest value at ca. 36.8Ma and then keep vibration in the last ca.36.8Ma. The obvious change in 34-38Ma is basically consistent with the significant changes in δ18O, δ13C and sealevel (m) value in 34Ma-38Ma (cooling E/O). The preliminary result reveals that climate cooling causes the decrease of Babio(Ba/Al) , AR Babio (Ba/Al) , and Ba/Al ratio. Paleoproductivity fluctuations is mainly related to the change of paleoclimate, perhaps also related to the drift of Pacific plate, abrupt events or CAEs etc. The change of biogenic Ba content in Pacific Ferromanganese crusts probably can be regarded as a signal of paleoproductivity pulses.

AB  - Abstract Production data analysis (PDA) is a very useful methodology to conduct transient rate and pressure analysis for shale gas wells. However, frequent shut-ins as well as nozzle size changing and well interference often occur for shale gas wells in China. This leads to abrupt changes, fluctuation, or even loss of production data. The existing PDA methods are incapable of addressing this issue. A new PDA method is proposed to solve the above problem. First, the model for shale gas wells is established and solved by Duhamel's principle and Laplace transform. The log-log curve curve for PDA is obtained. Second, the formation pressure distributions and the average formation pressures within the SRV area are calculated. Then, a virtual equivalent time is proposed by use of the average formation pressure. Thus, the production data with abrupt changes can be converted into several interconnected segments with known initial formation pressures. Numerical validations and field cases are conducted to verify the proposed method. For the field shale gas wells with several abrupt rate and pressure changes, the history matching provided by the commercial software with a skin factor agrees with the field data before the first shut-in. However, the estimated pressure and gas rate start to deviate from the field data continuously since the first shut-in, and the deviation becomes greater over time. Particularly after the third shut-in, the deviation is too large to history matching. The offset is mainly caused by significant discontinuities and subsequent cumulative errors. On the contrary, the history matching of pressure and gas rate with correction by virtual equivalent time are both in good agreement with the field data. This implies that the issues caused by abrupt changes or significant discontinuities of production data are satisfactorily addressed. Therefore, the results interpreted from the PDA such as fracture half-length and SRV are more accurate and confident.

AB  - ABSTRACT:We have studied theoretically and experimentally the formation of thermally-induced microcracks in Sioux quartzite and Westerly granite subjected to slow ( ≤ 2°C/min), uniform temperature changes. Intergranular thermal stresses develop in these rocks independently of the existence of a temperature gradient and arise because of the mismatch of thermal expansions of neighboring mineral grains. These stresses give rise to microcracks that develop preferentially along grain boundaries and secondarily as intragranular cracks. Acoustic-emission data reveal that thermal cracking occurs only after a threshold temperature (Tc ) is exceeded; Tc (Sioux Quartzite)~200°C, Tc (Westerly Granite)~75°C. In both rocks, thermal cracking specimens, acoustic emission is minor until the prior maximum temperature is reached, and then there is an abrupt increase of activity. Thermal cracking of Sioux quartzite is attributable directly to the marked thermal-expansion anisotropy of quartz, but also important is the temperature dependence of its elastic moduli, especially at and above the α-β transition. For Westerly granite, differential expansion between neighboring quartz and feldspar grains appears to play the dominant role in thermal-crack development at temperatures below the α-β transition of quartz. At higher temperatures differential thermal expansion of neighboring feldspar grains appears to be responsible for continued "loosening" of the aggregate. INTRODUCTIONAnalysis of thermal cracking of rock during non-uniform cooling, as in a geothermal reservoir, or heating, as in the vicinity of stored nuclear wastes, must incorporate the effects of temperature-gradient thermal stresses and intergranular thermal stresses. The latter stresses develop independently of a temperature gradient and are due to the different thermal expansions or contractions of neighboring mineral grains. Intergranular thermal stresses may give rise to microcracks that can significantly modify the mechanical properties of the intact rock and, in turn, may significantly affect the development of macrocracks induced by temperature-gradient thermal stresses.

AB  - Summary. An approximate mathematical model of the time variation of excess head at the middle of a shale layer during burial is obtained and used in the analysis of natural hydraulic fracturing by excess pore pressure. The fundamental variables that control fracturing are pore pressure. The fundamental variables that control fracturing are critical stress intensity factor, hydraulic conductivity, specific storage, Poisson's ratio, sedimentation rate, and shale-layer thickness. A simple fracture criterion is derived that shows that for usual values of the above variables, natural hydraulic fracturing is not possible. Fractures form only if the shale is excessively thick and has a low hydraulic conductivity. Depth bracket of fracture generation and closure is shallow. However, porosity may restrict the depth of fracture initiation. An abrupt increase in the sedimentation rate may cause fracture reopening at great depths. Introduction An understanding of natural hydraulic fracturing of shales is important in oil exploration. Measurement of oil potential in an area depends partly on identification of source potential in an area depends partly on identification of source and seal rocks. Natural hydraulic fracturing may aid primary migration of oil and increase source potential primary migration of oil and increase source potential but reduce sealing capacity of shales. Effective stress, e, which is ultimately responsible for deformation of rocks, is related to total stress, t, by = ,.............................(1) where p is pore-fluid pressure. The possibility of natural hydraulic fracturing has been investigated (see Goff) since Secor drew attention to jointing by natural hydraulic means. In contrast to the case of artificial hydraulic fracturing, however, rigorous treatment of natural hydraulic fracturing is not available. One reason for this is the complexity of the analytical solution of the differential equation governing vertical fluid flow out of a shale layer, which is H/ t = (Ch/Ss) 2H/ z2 + sg..................(2) A simple, approximate equation relating excess head at the middle of the shale to time may be derived that renders possible a crude analysis of natural hydraulic fracturing. Such an equation also should facilitate estimation of fluid pressures within sediments and decisions on whether a particular source or seal rock was subject to hydraulic fracturing from depositional history of the overlying sediments. Fluid Flow Out of a Shale Layer Time variation of excess head, H, at the middle of a shale layer of thickness 2h bounded by sand layers above and below may be approximated by H = Hi exp(-t/ )+ [1-exp(-t/ )]..........(3) where = Ssh2/Ch................................(4) and = .............................(5) (See Appendix A.) If the initial head, Hi, is zero, this reduces to H = [1-exp(-t/ )].......................(6) The accuracy of Eqs. 3 and 6 is good enough for the purpose of this analysis (Fig. 1). The ratio of H from Eq. purpose of this analysis (Fig. 1). The ratio of H from Eq. 6 to H computed by numerical solution of Eq. 2 remains within 0.9 to 1.1 for a wide range of cases. In Fig. 1, H1 is obtained from numerical solution of Eq. 1, and H2 is computed from Eq. 6. This ratio of H1 to H2 remains within 0.9 to 1.1. The rate of overburden, qs, changes abruptly during deposition of the overburden. Eq. 3 is applicable in such a case if time, t, is reset to zero and initial head, Hi, is reset to the present head at the time the rate changes. When sedimentation stops, the time variation of excess head, H, is given by: H = Hs exp(-t/ )...........................(7) The maximum value of H is Hmax = Ssh2 sqs/2Ch........................(8) SPEPE P. 191

AB  - AbstractThis paper presents the development of a subsea power transmission in medium voltage and variable frequency, as a key system for application of Boosting Technology and, more particularly, for Electrical Submersible Pumping in deep water wells. The focuses of this paper are mainly on the design and manufacture of subsea power cables and transformers for 1,000 m water depth. The production from a subsea well equipped with ESP's is a fact since October/94, with the first installation in Campos Basin, Brazil. The development of subsea power transmission in medium voltage and variable frequency will allow the installation of a Boosting System in deep water at long distance (25 km or more) from the production platform. The design and manufacture of subsea power cables and subsea power transformers, as well as the integration of the complete power system is a result of a Technological Cooperation Agreement with TRONIC, PIRELLI, SIEMENS A.G. and SIEMENS BRAZIL. As result from this agreement subsea power cables up to 12/20kV voltage level, conductor sizes from a 35 to 150 mm2. oil filled subsea power transformer rated at 759 kVA, nominal voltage ration 10,000/3,000 V and the electrical connectors to X-tree will be developed and manufactured. Brazillian Offshore Oil Field ScenarioIn the last few years, PETROBRAS has been making important oil discoveries in deep water, over 400 meters. The reserves in the fields located in deep water, over 400 meters, account for 64% of the total reserves in Brazil. The importance of deep water technology is also by the fact that 65% of the potential oil discoveries will be in deep and ultra deep water. The development of deep water oil fields in Brazil has been made by the use of floating production systems. In platforms, the oil flows from the subsea wells by gas lift injection. However, the distance from well to platform is limited by the reservoir pressure, which decline with depletion, requiring water injection. Gas list becomes less efficient when horizontal distance increase and BSW rises.Therefore, it's necessary to use another more efficient method for adding energy to the produced oil. PETROBRAS has chose the Boosting System drived by electric motors, but the development of a power transmission system in medium voltage and variable frequency for a long distance (25 km) is necessary. This method will allow to reduce the number of platforms to drain giant fields and will allow to supply power to electric motors installed in marginal wells. Electrical Submersible Pumps in Subsea Wells The Electrical Submersible Pump in a Subsea well is one of the projects of PROCAP 2,000. This project installed the first electrical submersible pump in subsea well in October/94. This installation was in 4-RJS-221 well, located at Carapeba Field, Campos Basin, Brazil. The success of this installation is the greatest encouragement for new installations in deep water wells.This new installation should be designed with power transmission in medium voltage under several conditions and drive of variable frequency at long distance from the production platform.

AB  - Abstract An important factor during the life of a heavy crude reservoir is the oil mobility. It depends on two factors, oil viscosity and oil relative permeability. Two characteristics of nanoparticles that make them attractive for assisting IOR and EOR processes are their size (1 to 100 nm) and ability to manipulate their behavior. Due to their nano-sized structure, nanomaterials have large tunable specific surface areas that lead to an increase in the proportion of atoms on the surface of the particle, indicating an increasing in surface energy. Nanoparticles are also able to flow through typical reservoir pore spaces with sizes at or below 1 micron without the risk to block the pore space. Nanofluids or "smart fluids" can be designed by tuning nanoparticle properties, and are prepared by adding small concentrations of nanoparticles to a liquid phase in order to enhance or improve some of the fluid properties. However the use of nanoparticles and nanofluids for oil mobility has been poorly studied. Hence, the scope of this work is to present the field evaluation of nanofluids for improving oil mobility and mitigate alteration of wettability in two Colombian heavy oil fields; Castilla and Chichimene. Asphaltenes sorption tests with two different types of nanomaterials were performed for selecting the best nanoparticle for each type of oil. An oil based nanofluid (OBN) containing these nanoparticles was evaluated as viscosity reducer under static conditions. Displacement tests through a porous media in core plugs from Castilla and Chichimene at reservoir conditions were also performed. OBN was evaluated to reduce oil viscosity varying oil temperature and water content. Maximum change in oil viscosity is achieved at 122°F and 2% of nanofluid dosage. The use of the nanofluid increased oil recovery in the core flooding tests, caused by the removal of asphaltenes from the aggregation system, reduction of oil viscosity, and the effective restoration of original core wettability. Two field trials were performed in Castilla (CNA and CNB wells), by forcing 200 bbl and 150 bbl of nanofluid respectively as main treatment within a radius of penetration of ~3 ft. Instantaneous oil rate increases of 270 bopd in CNA and 280 bopd in CNB and BSW reductions of ~11% were observed. In Chichimene also two trials were performed (CHA and CHB), by forcing 86 bbl of and 107 bbl of nanofluid as main treatment within a radius of penetration of ~3 ft. Instantaneous oil rate increases of 310 bopd in CHA and 87 bopd in CHB were achieved not BSW reduction has been observed yet. Interventions were performed few months ago and long term effects are still under evaluation. Results look promising making possible to think extending application of nanofluid in other wells in these fields.

AB  - The PDF file of this paper is in Russian. The development of carbonate reservoirs using peripheral and pattern water flooding typically achieves oil recovery factors ranging from 0.3 to 0.5, which is due to some complicating factors, such as, oil-wet surface of the pore space or the surface with intermediate type of wetting, unfavorable ratio of oil and water viscosities, presence of extensive structure of fractures, and significant variations of permeability down the reservoir section. In a complex geological environment, wells display abrupt fluctuations of water production that is an evidence of formation water being by no means the most efficient displacement agent. In these conditions, low-salinity water flooding can improve oil recovery. This paper reports on SCAL results of oil recovery factor determination and spontaneous imbibition using water with different composition and total solinity for Object 2 of Kharyaga oil field. Also, report contains design of on-site determination of residual oil saturation using Single Well Chemical Tracer test technology for evaluation of EOR efficiency. Laboratory tests showed, that low-salinity Jurassic water flooding with total salinity about 5 g/l could rase recovery factor up to 4% and also give incremental recovery due to effects of spontaneous imbibition for permability lower than 100 mD, which makes the injection of Jurassic water more preferable.

AB  - Summary Cheng et al. (2000) present a simple method to fit foam-simulation parameters without oil to data for pressure gradient as a function of superficial velocities of gas and liquid. The key in this process is the identification of “high-quality” (high gas fraction) and “low-quality” foam regimes. The method is essentially the same for the foam-model parameters in foam models in STARS (Cheng et al. 2000), UTCHEM (Cheng et al. 2000), or ECLIPSE (Schlumberger 2010). Often, however, available data are more limited: pressure gradient for one scan of foam quality at fixed total superficial velocity. We show how to extend this method tothe more-limited data set. The transition in regimes occurs at the foam quality with the maximum-pressure gradient. We illustrate the method by fitting parameters to several published data sets. Our approach is simple and direct. The model fit would be appropriate for an enhanced-oil-recovery process involving foam injection at finite water fraction, but not a surface-alternating-gas foam process involving large slugs of gas and liquid. For the latter process, the model fit should focus on data relevant to that process (i.e., at extremely high foam quality). The approach assumes an abrupt transition between high- and low-quality-foam regimes (e.g., a large value of epdry in the STARS foam model). If the transition is less abrupt, the parameter values quickly obtained by this method could provide the initial guess for a computer-based least-squares fit of all parameters, including a smaller value of epdry, and a check on the parameters so obtained.

AB  - ABSTRACT This paper presents various uses for the Drill Pipe Electric Log. A brief explanation of the equipment and its operation is described. Unique applications are discussed including its use on trouble wells, correlation in difficult areas and as a means of abnormal formation pressure determination. Multiple log runs become feasible with the economy of the Drill Pipe Electric Log. This can be quite significant on exploration wells. It has been demonstrated that log characteristics over a given interval may change with time and continued drilling. When multiple log runs are made, the characteristics at the time of each log run are known. Excessive filtrate invasion, saltwater flow or invasion by whole muds are a few of the conditions that may have altered a zone''s log features to the point of masking a potential pay. Another feature of multiple log runs presented is its use in establishing the protective casing point prior to encountering an abnormally pressured sand. Recent publications have explained the use of electric logs in determining formation pressures. Because the characteristic decrease in shale resistivity may be quite abrupt and also because correlation between wells may change drastically, it is important to make several log runs to determine the protective casing point. The economics of using the Drill Pipe Electric Log are presented by comparing its cost with the standard Induction-Electric Log in a hypothetical situation. Example logs are included with several pertinent illustrations. Limitations of the services are also listed.

AB  - AbstractIn October11994 Petrobras, leading a team of six companies has installed for the first time in the world an ESP in a subsea well. The subsea ESP system in the well RJS-221, located in 86 meters water depth, in the Carapeba oilfield has now completed more than two years in operation without failures. The success with this installation has encouraged Petrobras to proceed with this project in order to extend the application of this technology to 1150 meters water depth in the second Phase. This paper presents briefly the first subsea ESP installation, calling attention to the main aspects that make the difference from a conventional to a subsea ESP installation and focuses on the developments for the deepwater installation in the well RJS-477, in 11 07 meters water depth, in the East-Albacora oilfield by mid 1997.IntroductionThe oil production in the Brazilian coast is mainly focused on the giant reservoirs discovered in deepwater, making use of floating production systems, that receive the production directly from the satellite wells or from subsea manifolds. In Campos Basin 13 fixed towers were installed, all of them in shallow waters, up to 300 meters. From these, eight are in the so-called North-east Pole of Campos Basin.Stimulated by an increased oil demand, this production is being complemented by new discoveries in deeper and deeper waters. This production was for a long time based on natural flow, water injection in the reservoir and in the artificial lift method of gas lift.Production Development has signified the capacity to deal with the increase in the number of floating production units, with longer flowlines, as well as with the problems brought by well depletion and reservoir specific limitations.Water and gas lift injection used to be the first options to adopt in the majority of the cases. But the efficiency of these solutions is not high and they are not always feasible. Reservoir pressure may be insufficient to produce over long distances and gas lift loses a lot of efficiency in long horizontal flowlines,typical of subsea wells, as well as with the BSW increase.A new method was then required for oil production over long distances, specially from deepwater wells, allowing the platform to be placed in shallow waters, and for a reduction in the number of platforms, thus simplifying the production layout and reducing the investments.Within the PROCAP 2000 Program for deepwater technology development, a project was created by the end of 1992 in order to develop such a method.

AB  - Abstract Water coning in oil reservoirs is a complex phenomenon which poses a problem in the petroleum industry today. The upward movement of water into the production interval has an adverse effect on the production facilities and the total oil recovery of a particular field. In this paper, different strategies for analyzing and developing reservoirs with coning problems were developed and different implementation steps were suggested to properly optimize the recovery of these reservoirs. Our case study is an oil reservoir in the Niger delta region with strong aquifer drive. A numerical reservoir simulation study was carried out based on the structural top and base maps generated using 3-D seismic estimated reservoir rock and fluid properties, using actual reservoir/well data. Also, production performance analysis were carried out to ascertain the causes of non-conformance issues like high BSW, decline in production and reservoir pressure. Perforation panel plots were constructed for the Levels with respect to the initial fluid contacts to diagnose for high water cut, to investigate their impact on future performance scenarios and productivity of the currently producing wells. The recommended development scenarios were also compared with the nature and structure of the reservoirs (high dip and low dip) to show the best well patterns/placements that will improve recovery.

Thus the initial or uncompacted phase transforms to the compacted one. The coexistence and interaction of the two phases is considered so that the compacted phase accommodates structural changes to come about. First, the rate independent theory, with indirect incorporation of rate effects, is formulated and examined. Then, rate dependence is considered for load rates ranging from zero (creep) to dynamic wave propagation. The question of stability of the phase transformation process is addressed. It is found that during the abrupt process of pore collapse the material is highly susceptible to instability. The implications of an instability could be localization, possibly of periodic nature. The present formulation addresses, and has been verified with respect to, stress paths within the so-called "cap". Incorporation of post shear failure response and the post instability analysis will appear elsewhere.IntroductionThe reservoir rock effective stress (the stress carried by the skeleton structure) increases as hydrocarbons are withdrawn and pore pressure declines. Under such conditions, certain porous rocks experience a sudden increase in compressibility. This increase coupled with the accompanied irreversible deformation, is often termed as "pore collapse".

AB  - ABSTRACTThe resistance of Alloy 22 (N06022) to localized corrosion, mainly crevice corrosion, has been extensively investigated in the last few years. However, the behavior of Alloy 22 in concentrated aqueous solutions that may simulate concentrated ground waters was not fully understood. Systematic electrochemical tests using cyclic potentiodynamic polarization as well as the Tsujikawa-Hisamatsu electrochemical method were performed to determine the crevice corrosion susceptibility of Alloy 22 in simulated concentrated water (SCW), simulated acidified water (SAW) and basic saturated water (BSW). Results show that Alloy 22 is immune to crevice corrosion in SCW and SAW but may suffer crevice corrosion initiation in BSW. Results also show that in a naturally aerated environment, the corrosion potential would never reach the critical potential for crevice corrosion initiation. INTRODUCTIONAlloy 22 (N06022) is nickel (Ni) based and contains nominally 22% Chromium (Cr), 13% Molybdenum (Mo) and 3% tungsten (W). 1 Alloy 22 belongs to the Ni-Cr-Mo family of nickel based alloys, which also include alloys such as C-4 (N06455), C-276 (N10276), C-2000 (N06200), 59 (N06059) and 686 (N06686). 1 The Ni-Cr-Mo alloys were designed to withstand the most aggressive industrial applications, including reducing acids such as hydrochloric and oxidizing acids such as nitric. Chromium is the beneficial alloying element added for protection against oxidizing conditions and molybdenum is the beneficial alloying element to protect against reducing conditions. 2-4 The base element (nickel) protects the alloy against caustic conditions. 2-4 All three elements, Ni, Cr and Mo act synergistically to provide resistance to environmentally assisted cracking in hot concentrated chloride solutions. 2-4 The alloying elements Cr and Mo also provide resistance to localized corrosion such as pitting and crevice corrosion in chloride containing solutions. Some of the Ni-Cr-Mo alloys also contain a small amount of tungsten (W), which may act in a similar way as Mo regarding protection against localized corrosion. 5 Ni-Cr-Mo alloys are practically immune to pitting corrosion but they may suffer crevice corrosion under aggressive environmental conditions under the effect of chloride. The presence of other anions in the electrolyte inhibits crevice corrosion. 6-16 These anions include mainly nitrate, sulfate and carbonate. 6-16 A minimum ratio of inhibitor to chloride is needed for the inhibition to occur. 6-16 For example, for nitrate, it is generally accepted that a ratio (R) of concentration nitrate over concentration of chloride of 0.5 may be sufficient to inhibit crevice corrosion initiation and propagation in Alloy 22. 7,9,10,17Due to its excellent resistance to all forms of corrosion, Alloy 22 (N06022) has been selected to fabricate the external shell of the Yucca Mountain high-level nuclear waste containers. 18 The environment at the repository site is mostly dry or unsaturated. If water enters in contact with the containers it would be in the form of two main modes: (1) Dripping from the drift crown and walls and (2) Deliquescence of salts or dust collected during the early dry period.

AB  - ABSTRACTThe loads, stress and strain state of the ship structures are quite complicated under the condition of collision and grounding, etc. The failure criteria which are commonly used in numerical simulations of ship collision can't accurately represent the failure characteristics of hull steel under complicated stress. The ship plates absorb the most energy in the process of collision. The rupture of ship plates will cause huge damage in hull extremely easily. Complex stress in plate is mainly simplified as biaxial stress. Experiments were conducted to study the failure characteristics of high-strength hull steel under biaxial stress. Six different shapes of specimens were designed to study the influence of different biaxial stress. The specimens were loaded until destruction under quasi-static loading with a hemispherical indenter. The loading force and displacement of specimens in the midpoint were recorded. The Constant strain (CS) criterion, the BWH criterion and a modified BWH (m-BWH) criterion were used to simulate the experiment process in FE models. Simulation results show that the BWH criterion is in better agreement with the experiment results than the constant strain criterion, but the errors increase with strain ratio. The modified BWH criterion improves the accuracy when the strain ratio is high.INTRODUCTIONShip collision and grounding accidents will cause damage of hull structures, leakage of oil, environmental pollution and other serious consequences. Research on failure mode and failure criterion of hull structures and materials is meaningful for ship design.The most commonly used failure criterion in the ship collision simulation is the equivalent plastic strain which is usually decided by uniaxial tension experiment, namely the constant strain criterion. The equivalent plastic strain ranges from 0.1 to 0.7 in most finite simulation models (Calle and Alves, 2015). Although the constant strain criterion application is convenient, the simulation results are hypersensitive with the failure strain. The failure strain is an important parameter for the prediction of structural collapse mode and absorbed energy of the collision. Many scholars did researches on failure strain sensitivity and obtained similar results (Wang et al. 2000; Glykas and Barltrop, 2001; Kitamura, 2002; Yamada, 2005;). Mesh size also has strong influence on failure strain (Ehlers, 2010; Hogstrom, 2009; Yamada, 2005). Additionally, a damage evolution based on rupture displacement was proposed for materials after necking to avoid abrupt failure (Hogstrom et al., 2009).

AB  - Summary The Steam-Assisted Gravity Drainage (SAGD) process has been successfully implemented to produce ultra-viscous bitumen from the Athabasca oil sands in the province of Alberta. In the Hangingstone area, 15 pairs of SAGD wells had been drilled in the reservoir by 2006, each a maximum of 30 m in thickness and approximately 300 m in depth. The production reached an average of 8,000 BOPD in recent years. The reservoir is geologically characterized as a stacked incised valley with fills in fluvial to upper-estuarine channels. Thin mudstone layers and abrupt changes in facies caused by sedimentary deposits present complexities and difficulties for SAGD implementation. A 3D seismic survey was conducted in 2002 to obtain a clear view of geology that was fully utilized for planning additional wells. In order to evaluate SAGD efficiency and performance, a time-lapse 3D seismic survey was carried out in 2006. In this paper, P-wave velocity (Vp) maps, transformed from the seismic travel-time maps, were interpreted with a new methodology for evaluating the areal extent of the steam chamber zone created by the SAGD process. In the previous experimental study of seismic velocity measurements with oil sands cores, Vp was found to steeply drop with an increase in temperature and to gently decrease with an increase in pore-pressure. Based on the experimental results, a petrophysical model was formulated to express Vp as a function of temperature, pressure and water saturation. The high-pressure and high-temperature zone of the SAGD process should generate differences between the first (2002) and second (2006) Vp maps from which we can estimate the area of the reduced bitumen viscosity with a temperature increase. As effects of pressure are probably more areally extensive than effects of temperature, these two effects on the Vp maps need to be segregated. As a new method, a scaling factor for the Vp reduction was first estimated to adjust the laboratory-scale and field-scale. We then calculated a distribution of Vp reduction corresponding to steam chamber conditions in order to decouple composite effects of temperature and pressure, based on the petrophysical model. Distinguishing the high-temperature and high pore-pressure zone from the low-temperature and high pore-pressure zone, we could determine a steam chamber distribution. The bitumen volume in the steam chamber zone was estimated and compared with the actual production. The methodology, interpretation procedures and results obtained are presented in detail.

AB  - AbstractThis paper presents simple models to describe casing loading and wellhead movement during the completion (mechanical) phase and the production (thermal) phase. A wellhead-drop incident is investigated. The theory is simple, and the formulations are suitable for hand-calculation or spreadsheet. The presented models are suitable both for conventional and HP/HT (high-pressure/high-temperature) wells.This paper also investigates an abrupt wellhead drop of several feet for an offshore well. The incident took place during wellhead cooling following a routine shutdown. The expected wellhead cooling contraction did not occur. After a cooling period the wellhead suddenly released. A corroded segment of the surface casing collapsed and the wellhead dropped.IntroductionThe platform well sits in 1000 ft of water. There is a 165-ft air-gap between the mean sea level and the wellhead deck. The 26" environmental casing is piled 330' into the mud and it is not attached to the wellhead. The completion program consists of 18-5/8", 13-3/8" and 9-5/8" casing strings. The well produces through a 5-1/2" production tubing landed in a polished bore receptacle (PBR).First we look at the casing loading that occurred during the initial well completion. Casing loads are caused by adding and removing well tubulars and well control equipment. We consider constant temperature during the completion phase. The second part deals with wellhead growth caused by natural production and rise in temperature. In the third part, the failure of the 18-5/8"casing is analyzed as the wellhead drops 43 cm (17") below its cold position. In the fourth part, the incremental loads and wellhead movement data are summed using the principle of superposition. In this final part, the axial load and buckling limits for critical well tubulars are calculated and compared for the situation following the casing failure.It is difficult to estimate both the direction and the amount of well friction during casing loading and wellhead growth. Operational procedures and actual execution of the completion phase are complex, and unexpected events increase the uncertainty associated with tubular strain caused by downhole friction. The amount of frictional strain remaining in the casing strings after completion will impact subsequent calculations. In this study the analysis is performed in a frictionless environment using the projected height concept (Ref. 1). The axial weight of the well tubular without sliding friction is equal to its unit weight multiplied by the projected pipe height, regardless of the borehole inclination and path. The frictionless approach is attractive due to its simplicity and also because it gives a conservative estimate of casing loads and wellhead movement. In this approach, we use true vertical depth (TVD) for load calculations and measured depth (MD) for thermal expansion.Throughout this investigation, contraction is considered negative and expansion is positive. Similarly, axial compression is indicated with a negative sign and tension is positive.Casing Lloading at the Time of InstallationWe analyze the casing loading caused by well construction. The initial casing loading is needed for a complete description of the axial force in the well tubulars following the 18-5/8" casing failure.The equations used for wellhead movement and multistring loading were developed using classical mechanics. See Appendix A for the theory covering a three-string model.

AB  - Abstract One of the main activities of a reservoir engineer is to manage the production and injection of fluids in a reservoir. By managing the production and injection it is possible to react to the breakthrough of the injected fluids and control the rate at which BSW and GOR increase in the production wells. In wells completed in more than one target zone the reservoir management can be done by restraining or just closing the interval through which the injected fluids are inflowing. However to identify the interval through which the water or gas is produced in this kind of well is not an easy task, being the track of the paths through which the injected fluids flow in the reservoir (as well as in the neighborhood of the well) the main challenge of the reservoir management. In this paper a set of data of different wells of a Santos Basin Pre-salt reservoir is presented. Intelligent completions with more than one target zone are installed in these wells and the temperature data of each zone are analyzed. Simplified analytical models are employed to describe the various regime flows observed in these wells, thus providing some insights in order to characterize the flow. Temperature data of production and injection wells are analyzed in different scenarios were the gas and/or water saturation modifies near the wells. The main hypothesis adopted in this work is that the change in temperature behavior is associated to the modification of the saturation of the different fluids in the reservoir. This paper aims at estimating the length of the modified saturation region near the injection well by assuming that the thermal diffusion is predominant. By doing so the problem is described by the energy balance equation and the boundary and initial conditions depends on the condition of the well (if it is operating or closed). This methodology is further extended to analyze the change of fluids saturation near production wells in order to provide some insight about the breakthrough of injected fluids. By comparing the theoretical response of the methodology presented in this paper to that observed in the wells it is possible to make some conclusions about (i) the injection profile in wells where the isolation between the zones in the well's neighborhood was lost during the stimulation of the formation and (ii) about the distribution of the injected fluid in the reservoir near the wells, whose isolation between zones was not lost during the stimulation.

AB  - Abstract The fluids injection in oil reservoirs has the function to supplement the natural energy and in some cases is used to interact with the rock/oil system of reservoir, creating favorable conditions for oil recovery, for example lower interfacial tension, oil swelling, oil viscosity reduction and wettability modification. Polymer injection in heavy oil reservoirs is the subject of extensive studies since its implementation does not depend of major technological devices, requiring only mixing and filtration equipments in addition to those already used for common water injection. Moreover, polymers are not toxic and corrosive and can generate mobility ratios favorable in both borders of the injection seat. The adoption of this solution reduces the water/oil ratio of production, thus reducing the operational costs and consequently creating higher economic return. This work aims to evaluate the potential of polymer injection in heavy oil reservoirs. Therefore, using the reservoir simulation CMG´s IMEX, it was analyzed in heavy oil reservoirs the influence of the polymer injection on the mobility ratio, advanced water front during the breakthrough, the oil recovery factor and BSW. Tests with two models of reservoir were performed: homogeneous reservoir and heterogeneous stratified reservoir. Water injection was proposed as a comparison to the polymer injection method. Introduction The injection of polymers, as an advanced recovery method, is a subject that has assumed a great relevance inside the national and international scenario. In Brazil, Petrobras implemented three polymers injection pilot-projects in the last two decades (Melo et al., 2002 e 2005). The purpose of these initiatives was to obtain practical knowledge of the process for a possible future application in other reservoirs. Many other papers, as described by Du and Guan (2004) and Kaminsky et al. (2007), propose paths for the application of the technique, detailing the whole process of reservoir simulation and laboratory tests.  Differently from the major recovery process, in which the purpose is designed to enhance the displacement efficiency by the reduction of the residual oil saturation, the polymer injection is directly related to the swept efficiency increase by the reduction of the mobility ratio, which is the most important singular characteristic in a project of water injection (Lake, 1989). According to Rosa et al. (2006), the mobility ratio of a water injection project is the relationship between the injected water mobility, measured at the residual oil saturation, and the oil mobility, measured at the connate water saturation, as presented in Equation 1. Mobility ratio smaller or equal 1 (one) is considered favorable.

AB  - Summary. A new procedure has been developed to predict the abrupt in-situ compaction and the associated surface subsidence above high-porosity carbonate fields that show pore collapse. The approach is based on an extensive laboratory compaction study in which the effects of carbonate @, porosity, core preparation, pore saturant, horizontal/vertical stress ratio, and loading rate on pore-collapse behavior were investigated. For a number of carbonate types, a trendline was established that describes the relationship between the porosity after collapse and the vertical effective stress. This trendline concept, in combination with existing subsidence models, enables reservoir compaction and surface subsidence to be predicted on the basis of wireline porosity logs. Static and dynamic elastic constants were found to be uncorrelated during pore collapse. The position of the trendline depends strongly on carbonate type, pore saturant, loading rate, and stress ratio. Therefore, procedures are given to derive the correct in-situ trendline from laboratory compaction experiments. IntroductionIn general, the bulk compressibilities of carbonates are much lower than those of sandstones of comparable porosity. Field cases of considerable reservoir compaction and surface subsidence caused by hydrocarbon production from carbonate reservoirs are therefore rare. In high-porosity carbonates, however, the phenomenon of pore collapse can occur in the pressure regime prevailing during production. These carbonates, which are usually well consolidated, exhibit a low compressibility up to a certain stress level but strongly compact at higher stress. This sudden increase in compressibility, coupled with a large irreversible deformation, is called pore collapse. Several authors have observed this phenomenon in the laboratory. In the field, the resultant reservoir compaction and associated surface subsidence can be large. In the Ekofisk field offshore Norway, reservoir compaction caused by pore collapse has resulted in a reduction in the platform airgap of some 3 m [10 ft],3 while up to 7 m [23 ft] of surface subsidence has been predicted for gas-bearing carbonate buildups offshore Sarawak. Objectives and Scope In land operations, subsidence may cause environmental problems, while seabottom subsidence must be taken into account when offshore platforms are designed. Severe reservoir compaction can result in damage to casings and liners, and can have consequences for the perforation policy. Although the productivity of the carbonate reservoir can seriously decline as a result of any accompanying permeability reduction, pore collapse may also act as a drive mechanism. Early prediction of the time evolution and amount of pore collapse to be expected is therefore essential for both onshore and offshore operations. In this study, the relationships between material properties, such as carbonate rock type, porosity, Brinell hardness number, static and dynamic elastic constants, and pore-collapse behavior, have been investigated in detail. In addition, special attention has been given to parameters that could affect the translation of laboratory experiments to field conditions, such as sample preparation, pore content, loading rate, and horizontal/vertical stress ratio. A procedure is proposed for field application of the laboratory results obtained. Experimental Procedures Sample Selection and Preparation. Experiments were carried out on Danian outcrop samples, Danian and Maastnchtian chalk samples from various North Sea fields, chalk samples from a Middle East field, and moldic limestone and dolomite samples from a field in the Far East. (About 190 samples have been studied altogether.) All samples used for uniaxial compaction experiments had a diameter of 50 mm [2 in.] and a length of about 30 mm [1.2 in.]. For yield-strength and hydrostatic loading tests, samples were used with a length-to-diameter ratio of 2 to limit end-plate effects. Scouting experiments showed a considerable influence of sample orientation on the pore-collapse stress level; therefore all samples were drilled vertically with inspect to the earth's surface, simulating field-compaction conditions.uring the initial stages of the study, the samples were not cleaned before the compaction experiments to avoid any influence of cleaning agents on pore-collapse behavior. Instead, the samples were dried in a vacuum oven and subsequently saturated with "chalkified" water, which was obtained by boiling determined water concerning crushed sample material. After the experiment, the samples were cleaned with a calculated of chlorothene and methanol and their porosities were determined. The initial porosity of the sample was then calculated on the basis of the measured stress/strain curve. Once it had been established that sample cleaning does not influence the subsequent compaction behavior (see the section on Influence of Loading Rate), the samples were cleaned before the experiment, resulting in a more accurate determination of the initial porosity. Experimental Setup. Pore collapse is studied by performing compaction experiments in a triaxial compaction cell (Fig. 1). In this cell, the sample is enclosed in an impermeable elastomer sleeve, which is loaded by hydraulic pressure around its circumference. Axial stress is applied by a piston. Axial and radial stresses can be changed independently, and the axial loading rate can be varied between 0.05 and 0.1 x 10(4) MPa/h [0.5 and 10(4) bar/hr]. Piezoelectric crystals enable the measurement of compressional- and shear-wave velocities. The radial deformation induced by the increasing axial stress is measured by a radial displacement transducer. In the uniaxial strain experiments, this signal drives a feedback system that controls the radial stress rate in such a way that the diameter of the sample remains constant during the compaction experiment, thus simulating reservoir compaction at zero lateral strain. In this procedure, end effects resulting from friction SPEFE P. 340^

AB  - AbstractThe Alwyn North complex is located in Block 3/9a of the Northern North Sea, UK sector. Production commenced in 1987 from the Middle Jurassic Brent Group, and was supported by water injection from early 1988. In 1997 a Tertiary Miscible Gas Injection project was sanctioned with incremental reserves for the four main reservoir panels, estimated at 33Mboe. This figure includes a waterflood phase post MGI and field depressurisation, and was evaluated against a continued waterflood scenario.Gas injection commenced in late 1999 into the Brent East-South panel followed in September 2000 by injection into the Brent North West panel. The early part of the project was interrupted by facilities difficulties, however by mid 2002 1.68Gsm3 of gas had been injected.In the 2 1/2 years since first injection, incremental oil has been observed in four wells showing between a 2 to 10 fold increase in oil potential. Associated gas breakthroughs have been experienced in 2 of these wells and can be related to zones of high permeability. A positive correlation can be seen between the gas injection rate and the oil production potential and by 2 1/2 years into the project around 1 1/2 million bbl of incremental oil had been recovered. Ensuring voidage replacement is maintained is key to the success of this project with average reservoir pressures only marginally higher than Minimum Miscibility Pressure.Intensive reservoir monitoring (permanent downhole gauges, wellhead pressure & temperature data, tracers, production logging, fluid sampling and regular well tests) has been fundamental to improving the understanding of field performance. This information has been regularly integrated into full field geological and compositional simulation models to optimise the near term performance of the panels and to plan the future strategy. Alwyn North Brent Geological Setting, Discovery and Field DescriptionThe Alwyn North field, 100% owned by TotalFinaElf Exploration UK PLC, was discovered in 1975 in the UK sector of the North sea, 140km east of the Shetlands. Fig. 1. The Alwyn North Area consists of 3 main reservoir units, Brent, Statfjord and Triassic. The reservoirs are tilted fault blocks, tilting to the west. Fig. 2. Degradation zones have formed on the eastern edge where the blocks have been eroded. As a result of faulting with two principal fault trends NNW-SSE and ENE-WSW, the Brent reservoir is split into several panels, Brent East (BE), Brent North (BN) and the west panels comprising of Brent North West (BNW), Brent Central West (BCW) and Brent South West (BSW). Fig. 3. The oil composition and OWC varies between the panels, an undersaturated oil in Brent East (39°API) progressively getting lighter in Brent West, with a volatile oil encountered in Brent South West. The Brent is a sequence of sands/silts and shales deposited in deltaic and shoreface environments. Fig. 4. In Alwyn North Brent it is the Tarbert and Ness that are within the oil bearing leg, representing an oil column of just over 100m. The Upper Tarbert is a massive sand with good connectivity and permeability, while the lower Tarbert is of poorer quality and more channel like, although locally can be good channel sands. The Ness is a channel system with poor vertical connectivity between layers. The reservoir porosities average ~18% and the permeability is in the range 10mD to >1D.First production from Alwyn North was in November 1987 and was followed by water injection in early 1988 to provide pressure support. All panels have undergone waterflood with the exception of BN which has a natural aquifer and BSW which has undergone natural depletion. The initial development has been complemented with campaigns of infill drilling to target unswept or poorly drained pockets of remaining oil. Fig. 5 shows the additional oil potential added to the Alwyn Brent field as a result of the infill drilling campaigns and MGI.

AB  - Abstract The production optimization in Oil & Gas fields is an activity which relies on a wide range of parameters and variables, where many of them can vary over time due to production trends and inherent uncertainty. However, while developing the optimal strategy for oil production, it is usual to ignore those uncertainties, which can affect the optimum operational point, leading to disappointment and loss of expected production. This paper aims to analyze the influence of the water cut (BSW) into the gas lift optimization process. Statistical data from producer wells are combined with multiphase flow correlations to estimate the uncertainty in the production variables. A mathematical optimization model is built using the Mixed Integer Linear Programming Technique (MILP), linearizing the oil well performance curves. For each uncertain scenario the optimization model was run. A case study with representative data shows that the uncertainties importance grows in the most constrained scenarios and how the absence of uncertainty can overestimate the expected oil production.

AB  - AbstractThis paper discusses the design and wellbore stability considerations to drill four underbalanced horizontal wells in a mature, pressure-depleted and high permeability reservoir in the onshore Estreito field - Northeast of Brazil. To do so, it was determined the minimum mud weight that produced the minimum ECD below reservoir pressure, but above the lower collapse pressure, that keeps the wellbore integrity. For that, two approaches were employed:an in-house linear elastic stability simulator, named SEST, and a poroelastic simulator that takes into account the plastic yielded area around the wellbore.The main operational aspects related with stability of the first two horizontal underbalanced wells are also discussed. Finally, the results indicate that the methodology adopted in the design was successfully applied in the field.IntroductionThe Estreito field in Rio Grande do Norte - Northeast of Brazil, was discovered in 1982 and since then 764 wells have already been drilled by Petrobras in the area. Trying to produce the oil below the A u River, not accessible for vertical and non-economic for directional, four horizontal wells were drilled between 1995 and 1998. In those wells the Overbalanced Drilling (OBD) technique was employed.For this year (2000), Petrobras is planning to drill four more horizontal wells, but this time, following the world tendency, employing the Underbalanced Drilling (UBD) technique. In Fig.1 are shown the location of the Estreito Field and the position of the horizontal wells.Geological CharacteristicsThe Estreito Field is localized in the onshore portion of the Potiguar Basin. The main reservoir in the field, is a heterogeneous and low consolidated sandstone of fluvial origin interbeded with claystone stringers. This reservoir has high porosity and high permeability. In addition, some wells presented sand production problems. Table 1 shows a summary of the main reservoir characteristics.The oil produced has high viscosity >1000 cp) in bottomhole conditions. The vertical wells have average oil production of 6 m3/day (36.8 bbl/day) with steam injection and 2 m3/day (12,6 bbl/day) without. The average initial BSW was 40% and today is 80%.Underbalanced Drilling ConceptThe Underbalanced Drilling (UBD) emerged as a distinct technique in the late 1980 s in the USA and Canada. Since then, it has gained acceptance among the operators and many wells have been drilled around the world employing this tecnology with varying degrees of success. The main characteristic of the UBD is to drill a well with an intentionally designed Equivalent Circulation Density (ECD) lower than the formation pore pressure. As a result, the formation fluids will be produced while the drilling progresses.When properly designed and executed, the UBD offer improvements over the conventional OBD technique, such as(1,2): minimizes formation damage and improve well productivity, increases rate of penetration and extends drill bit life, allows better characterization and reservoir evaluation while drilling, eliminates lost of circulation and differential sticking, provides an alternative method of well control.Our goal in employing this technique in Estreito field is to minimize formation damage and improve well productivity.As a disadvantages we can cite some(1,2): increased costs due to additional equipments required, complexity of the operations with a well alive, safety considerations, decrease of the borehole stability due to reduced bottomhole pressure.

AB  - Abstract There are several case studies showing that water injection apparently induces fault reactivation in oil and gas fields. However, there are not many publications in literature relating water production increasing with fault reactivation caused by depletion. The unexpected water production by fault reactivation related to depletion, promotes a huge impact on an oil field production, reducing the reservoir drainage efficiency and causing premature aging of operating plants, in some cases generating production bottlenecks due to produced water treatment limitations. This paper presents parameters that influence fault reactivation mechanism and their importance in early water production. In order to evaluate the phenomenon, a failure stability parameter that can be monitored during reservoir production time life is proposed and its behavior can be analyzed by comparison with produced water rate. The methodology is based on Mohr-Coulomb failure criterion using a simplified approach. Basically, the method considers the change in the state of effective stresses, vertical and horizontal, during production and its ratio (σh/σv) called K0.The relationship of effective stress necessary for the Mohr circle touches the envelope of rupture for a given frictional angle, called K1, is also considered. Thus, it is possible to observe the stress state changing as field production occurs using flow simulation. Fault reactivation analysis is obtained from the difference K0 minus K1, being K0 less or equal to K1, the condition at which depletion can   induce faults in the reservoir. The method has been successfully applied on an unconsolidated sandstone reservoir from Campos Basin, explaining the evolution of anomalies in BSW (basic sediment and water) values that could not be predicted ignoring the theory of fault reactivation by depletion. Recognizing that fault reactivations contribute to the unexpected water production is an important changing of paradigm in oil industry. The determination of the parameter of reactivation by depletion constitutes an important mark to indicate the right moment for beginning waterflooding. Many mature fields that present high Water Cut values, previously thought to have occurred due to rising of water-oil contact, may be revisited and restudied using the theory of fault reactivation by depletion. The approach can help to identify undrained-overlooked areas where infill drilling projects could be implemented, extending oil production and increasing oil recovery factors.

AB  - Abstract Many producing assets in the world have reached the so-called mature phase of development. Some of these assets have been producing for 30 to 40 years or more, which is typically beyond the design life, and have reached a water to oil ratio of 3 to 9 or more. There are many issues that affect the productivity and economic viability of these fields. Some of the challenges include integrity uncertainty in the wells, flow lines, and facilities; production bottlenecks due to the shift in gas, oil and water ratios; erosion/corrosion; increased sand production and handling costs; high chemical consumption and treatment costs; and obsolete monitoring and control systems that are incompatible with new technologies and which contribute to the need for a large number of operations staff. Generally operators are faced with the commercial decision whether to sell the asset to a low cost operator, reinvest in the asset, or incur the cost of decommissioning. While the number and complexity of these challenges are significant, there are nevertheless a number of viable options for extending the economic life of such assets. Hydrocarbon recovery and production from these fields can be enhanced by infill drilling; acid and fracture stimulation; by implementing a range of remediation techniques such as recompletion with smart systems to reduce water and solids influx to surface facilities; and by the implementation of improved and enhanced recovery methods. Selecting the optimal strategy requires a holistic perspective on subsurface issues, wells, and surface facilities, and an ability to make projections of integrated performance. This is greatly facilitated by first developing a root cause understanding of the reservoir and production fluid characteristics, and second, the use of analysis tools that allow quick and reasonably accurate assessment of options. In order to increase value from matured fields, the goal is to increase oil recovery from the historical average of 35% and to optimize production by improving the operational efficiency. To achieve this goal, in this paper we will put forward two key imperatives that extend the life of a mature field: (1) Finding and accessing the by-passed oil and (2) Maintaining High uptime during Asset production and operation. In this paper, several mature fields in Europe, Far East and Middle East are analyzed and presented in order to: highlight the root causes for either low production and or higher operating costs; assess the impact of both surface and subsurface uncertainties in multiple development planning scenarios; develop the best strategies and options for improved reservoir, well and facilities management;   demonstrate the contributions of implemented new technologies that optimized performance of artificial lift, minimized downtime by well intervention and reduced operational costs by fluids flow assurance in well and surface facilities; and   list the technical and economical challenges that still face the industry.

AB  - INTRODUCTIONThe effective stress in a hydrocarbon reservoir increases as a result of the decline in pore pressure associated with the withdrawal of fluids. Under such conditions, certain porous rocks experience a sudden increase in compressibility. The phenomenon that leads to such an irreversible deformation, is often termed as "pore collapse" and is believed to be a leading cause for abrupt reduction in production. It is usually accompanied by subsidence of the ground surface and may result in sand production, wellbore instability, etc. [ 1].For a safe and efficient management of the production facilities in the fields involving pore collapse-prone reservoir rocks, an effective simulation is warranted. In this paper, different aspects of numerical simulation are outlined. As a field example, a nonlinear finite element (NLFE) idealization of the Ekofisk field, where the problems of reservoir compaction and surface subsidence have been reported, is carded out, followed by a brief discussion of the numerical results. It has to be noted here that the input data used here for the simulation does not represent the actual practice after the year 1986.DIFFERENT ASPECTS OF A SIMULATION TASKSome important aspects which have to be given attention while carrying out the simulation of extremely complex phenomena of reservoir compaction and surface subsidence in an optimized yet efficient way, are outlined below.A subsiding field encompasses a number of zones, involving the reservoir and its surroundings, which contribute to its subsidence. The main cause of the subsidence is the reservoir compaction resulting from the increase in the effective stress due to pore pressure depletion. The most desirable simulation would obviously require a three-dimensional idealization of the field. A simpler and computationally more efficient alternative is to adopt a plain strain or axisymmetric idealization of the domain. The factors that govern the selection of a suitable spatial idealization are: geometry of the field/reservoir, pore pressure depletion zones and depletion scenarios, amount of field data available, the level of sophistication desired, depending upon the simulation goals, and computer time and available storage facilities.Rocks in general exhibit material nonlinearity particularly when the porosities are high. The rate of loading may also influence the material behavior. For the areas surrounding the reservoir, it is common to assume a linear material behavior for computational efficiency. When dealing with a nonlinear material along with finite elements, care should be taken to account for the different stages of material behavior which may create potential numerical problems.A depleting reservoir is subjected to both the self-weight and an increase in effective stress due to withdrawal of hydrocarbons from the reservoir matfix. Since the nature of these two loadings is different, separate approaches are generally adopted in subjecting the reservoir matrix to these loadings. The first step in simulating the field conditions is to subject the whole domain to selfweight. Since the hydrocarbon in the producing regions of the reservoir is under high pressure before production, the state of stress caused by this internal pressure should also be accounted for at this stage. This step ensures that the state of stress in the field corresponds to the initial, preproduction stage.

AB  - AbstractThis paper reviews one recent example of benefits of the implementation of a full control of wells tool offshore Guinea Gulf.This field case confirms the full control of wells smart automation increases by 10% the daily oil production of a mature field. It also confirms production increase above 20% under sensitive situations.Using measurements and adjustments only at well head avoids work over and ensures robustness. Setting parameters related to physics such as ranking or starting lift gas tunes the standard sequences to any well and topsides.Other fields applications include dual gas lift and dynamic control of gas coning to maximize recovery.Upgrading the well control to digital allows a remote operation. High quality data improves understanding the behavior of mature wells.Beyond this supervision, two levels of control algorithm provide with a continuous and autonomous control of the unmanned platforms.This smart control monitors and automates both single well and platform levels to handle transient phases and to face unforeseen behavior of reservoir, wells and facilities.Automated sequences help the operators if any trouble on a well or topsides. Remote manual operation cannot account continuously and accordingly for many wells particularly during hurried restart phases.This smart control increases the uptime and efficiency of wells and topsides. It stabilizes at source the compression and topsides intake. It also increases the recovery factor.IntroductionThe Sendji offshore field has been started-up in 1983 offshore Congo: see figure 1 field location and major data.The average water cut of this mature field was above 60% in 1999. 54 out of the 55 oil producer wells are gas lifted. These wells are located in 4 unmanned platforms plus one platform close to the central one. Fluids are transferred to the central platform under multiphase flow.Oil is produced from 12 heterogeneous Albian reservoirs with sandstone or lime. Operation difficulties are increased by sharp differences between the wells. Some of them are unconsolidated which require specific operational procedures to prevent formation damage. Water drive activity depends on the reservoir causing long transient phenomena during the restart phase. Oil viscosity changes from 4 to above 60 cPo under the reservoir conditions. Some reservoir induces wax and thick emulsion problems.The major driving force to consider an upgrade of the well control with an automation was a poor uptime. Due to old installation and difficult operating conditions, shut down of wells and facilities were frequent during day and night.Improving the well control was motivated by other consequences of the surges coming from the wells. They were causing temporary overload due to a limited capacity of water treatment. The surges also disturb the export line which is common with other fields.A control upgrading could improve the touchy well operation due to sand production, emulsion and wax. Different start-up and restart procedures according to each well were difficult to fully apply by all the shifts sometimes confused by the almost unpredictable behavior of some wells.The OPEX increase due to the production decline was a concern. The 5 platforms make the operation heavy.Upgrading the well control to digital allows a remote operation. High quality data improves understanding the behavior of mature wells. However, limiting digital control to remote operation requires the full hardware and has limits when operating mature fields. An efficient dynamic control of a whole field is not practical.A well control upgrading has been considered with a smart automation using the full control of wells. These control algorithms were already widely field proven over almost 10 years in the TFE group.The expected benefits were an oil increase of about 1000 bopd and remote soft well restarts with validated procedures. The project has excluded 7 wells with a too poor production potential.

AB  - AbstractFlow Assurance started to be a concern in PETROBRAS in the mid 80's, with the development of the Albacora Field, which was the first field produced at a water depth below 400 meters in Campos Basin. Since that time, PETROBRAS relies heavily on technological research and development to provide solutions that can grant the safe, continuous and optimized operation of its subsea fields. This paper reviews the efforts regarding Flow Assurance Management in Campos Basin, under a historical point of view, following the new challenges that were posed as water depths became deeper and deeper, and the techniques and practices developed to face them. Also are reported here the current R&D efforts under the PROCAP- 3000 program, aiming to address Flow Assurance Management in water depths up to 3,000 meters (9,840 ft). IntroductionSince Flow Assurance started to be a concern in PETROBRAS in the mid 80's, with the development of the Albacora field, large investments have been made in R&D, through the PROCAP program, aiming to make viable the production and pipeline transportation of oil in this harsh environment, at water depths below 400 meters in Campos Basin. This scenario is where the occurrence of waxes, hydrates, asphaltenes and scale become a critical issue. The first challenge faced in the beginning of the production of the Albacora Field was to keep the continuous operation of the pilot production system, which was not originally designed to handle the large degree of wax deposition that was taking place in the production lines. The first solution was to change the production line, which was very expensive and did not really solve the problem. This challenge was overcome with the in-house development of the thermo-chemical method known as SGNTM ?Nitrogen eneration System. The lessons learned with this pilot system were the driven forces of the development of methods to predict and prevent wax deposition, which will be discussed in this paper. These methods incorporated a new way to design the production system, and were eventually used with success in the development projects of subsequent fields in Campos Basin, such as Marlim and Roncador. When the development of Marlim took place, in the early 90's, already reaching water depths of 1,000 meters (3,280 ft) and below, cases of hydrate formation started to appear, initially in the completion phase. With the increase of the BSW in the production phase, hydrate formation in production lines and subsea equipment also became a problem. Taking a similar strategy to the one used for dealing with wax deposition in Albacora, PETROBRAS invested in the research and development of methods to predict, prevent and control hydrate formation in the production of deep offshore fields. Nowadays in PETROBRAS, and particularly in Campos Basin, Flow Assurance is still a problem and a challenge for this production scenario. But the learning process and the investment made in R&D turned the Flow Assurance Management a well-developed and successful issue, which extends its scope beyond the waxes and hydrates formation phenomena, dealing also with strategies to control scaling, emulsions, asphaltenes and severe slugging as well.

AB  - SPE Members AbstractA large percentage of boreholes drilled in the Mahakam delta area in East Kalimantan are adversely affected by tectonic stress. Stress imbalance in the borehole results in enlarged and elongated holes and borehole breakouts in the shales. Pad type logging devices are seriously affected by such borehole conditions. The use of a short axis logging kit enables good logging data to be acquired in such boreholes. The stress imbalance can be minimized, by optimizing mud weights used in drilling. through estimations of in-situ stress and mechanical properties obtained from shear sonic logging data. IntroductionEnlargement and elongation of a borehole in a preferential direction has been a well known phenomenon in the drilling industry. Only during the past 15 years however, and mainly during the last decade, has much attention been given to the problem. Such deformations has been termed "Borehole Breakouts". The theory of borehole breakout can be summarized as follows : * At the time of drilling, when rock is exposed to unequal stress, shear failure may occur close to the borehole wall in the zone of shear amplification. * It is hypothesized that vertical shear failures will occur parallel to two planes approximately 60 degrees on either side of the direction of minimum stress. * The intersection of the shear fractures then leads to breakout in the direction of minimum horizontal stress. The determination of the direction of breakout thus yields information on the in-situ stress direction as observed in North America and Northern Europe. Usually breakouts are identified by an abrupt ovalisation of the borehole (usually in the shaly zones). It is worth noting that breakout also occurs in naturally fractured reservoirs. In this case, the orientation of borehole elongation is in the direction of the maximum stress. In this condition borehole breakout could be used as an indicator of fracturing of these rocks. A typical example can be found in the Austin Chalk in South Texas. As we mentioned before, the fact that breakouts are identified by abrupt ovalisation of the borehole is very important : in highly deviated holes, an elliptical shape is "washed out" due to the rotation of the drill pipes. However, such intervals normally show a gradual enlargement over long stretches whereas "breakouts", due to stress release, lead to abrupt diameter variations. In these deviated wells, inspection of the caliper log will usually identify this, as mechanical action is expected to give a smoother curve. IDENTIFICATION OF BOREHOLE ELONGATION The measurement of borehole asymmetry, or ellipticity, was possible some time ago when the four-arm dipmeter came into the market : its opposed pair of calipers permitted a more accurate description and measurement of borehole shape than any other caliper tool of the past. Plumb and Hickman (1985) proposed criteria for recognizing breakouts from four-arm dipmeter logs and distinguishing them from other causes of borehole ellipticity. Figure 1 illustrates the common interpretation of borehole geometry. P. 99^

AB  - Abstract A major cause of increase in the number of well abandonments in small heterogenous formations with high geological complexities is early water breakthrough into completions which leaves pockets of bypassed oil that ultimately affects the overall recovery from such formations. This paper highlights some reservoir management strategies adopted to improve reserves from a Niger Delta formation with an API of 22 Deg. Reservoir management strategies adopted included the use of down hole gauges, inflow control devices, and detailed production/injection surveillance. Updated 3D simulation model and material balance analysis were also used for evaluation of waterflood recovery efficiency and real time Reservoir management decisions. Other Reservoir management practice helped in stimulating gas cap expansion that increased daily oil rate from this reservoir and field gas rate that helped in gas lifting wells in other heavy oil reservoirs with high BSW.

AB  - ABSTRACTTi Grade 7 (UNS R52400) is proposed as the corrosion resistant material for fabricating the waste package drip shield, for the potential nuclear waste repository at Yucca Mountain. Although Ti Grade 7 possesses excellent resistance to both crevice and general corrosion, it has been hypothesized that the corrosion mechanism of Ti Grade 7 in basic saturated water (BSW) could be different below and above a threshold temperature around 80°C. In this work, the bi-linear corrosion rate behavior of annealed and welded Ti Grade 7 in BSW-12 was studied based on weight loss, corrosion rate, activation energy, and macro- and micro-surface analysis in a temperature range from 70 to 90°C. When considering the bi-linear corrosion rate behavior around 80°C, it is hypothetical that the corrosion of Ti Grade 7 below ~ 80°C is an athermal process, while above this temperature the corrosion process is a thermally activated mechanism. The oxide film thickness, the Ti/O elemental atomic ratio in oxide layer, the corrosion rate and activation energy all seem to be consistent with the apparent post-test specimen color, suggesting a transition in corrosion mechanism around 80°C with the crystal structure of the oxide remaining unchanged. However, further investigations based on the changes in oxide film composition, crystal structure and thickness with exposure time and temperature will reduce remaining uncertainties associated with the bi-linear corrosion rate hypothesis.INTRODUCTIONThe Nuclear Waste Policy Act of 1982 as amended in 1987 designated Yucca Mountain in Nevada as the potential site to be characterized for high-level nuclear waste (HLW) disposal. (1) In 2002, the Secretary of the US Department of Energy recommended Yucca Mountain to the US president to be the designated repository site, citing "sound science" and "compelling national interests". The design concept for geological containment of HLW is a double-wall canister structure with an inner structural container and an outer concentric barrier made of the corrosion-resistant material. This concept was later modified to the current "Enhanced Design Alternative" (EDA). (2) The EDA for geological containment of high-level nuclear waste includes a two-layer waste canister structure with the outer layer made of Alloy 22 fitting concentrically over a thicker inner structural barrier fabricated from 316 NG (nuclear grade) stainless steel. The whole package will be covered by a self-supported thick Ti Grade 7 mailbox-shaped drip shield. (3'4) The current design concept is schematically shown, with illustration of the mailbox-shaped drip shield, in Figure 1. (3,4) The minimum target lifetime for containment of HLW without exceeding a regulatory specified individual dose rate at the site boundary is 10,000 years. (5). Over the years, numerous studies have been performed to evaluate the susceptibility to stress corrosion cracking, general, localized, galvanic and microbial ? (26789101112) (131415) corrosmn for Alloy 22 . . . . . . . and Ti Grade 7. ' ' The authors studied the general and crevice corrosion of Alloy 22 and Ti Grade 7 in 6 0 - 105°C basic saturated water (BSW-12). (16'17'18). While it was found that both materials were not susceptible to crevice corrosion in the temperature range atter up to eight weeks' of exposure, a bi-linear behavior in corrosion rate of Ti Grade 7 was noted around the temperature of ~ 80°C. The authors, based on the preliminary results, hypothesized that the corrosion of Ti Grade 7 in BSW-12 environment might go by two different mechanisms below and above the threshold temperature of~ 80°C. (16'17) The objectives of the present investigation are to study the general corrosion behavior of Ti Grade 7 in this temperature r

AB  - Abstract Sand production in oil and gas wells is a complex problem that requires an integral analysis of rock mechanics, mineralogy, granulometry, etc. that allows a risk management in order to make the best technical and economic decision. In this study the background, strategy used in the past and in the present to tackle the problem of sanding, and Cases of evaluation of alternatives SEM (sand exclusion and management) in the recent history of the fields Casabe, Lisama, Galán, Llanito and Bonanza, located in the basin of the Middle Magdalena Valley in Colombia, are shown. The effects of water injection and the gravel packing, in the low drainage and repression of the reservoir in the Casabe field are shown. These effects are: injected water distribution, behavior of pressure and sand cleaning jobs in packaged and unpackaged wells, production, effective injectivity and bsw before and after the gravel packings, number of wells packaged, abandoned producer wells, injectors collapsed, etc. Also mentioned are other factors that affected the low drainage and the repression of the reservoir, such as: reservoir heterogeneity, granulometry (% fines), mineralogy (migratory and swelling clays, etc.). After Casabe field experience, the problem was approached very conservatively, limited at the drawdown control and the use of special metallurgy and sand cleaning jobs, etc. Today the problem is focusing differently, considering new technologies and an integral analysis of the reservoir. To carry out the above, the methodology SEM (Sand Exclusion and Management) was developed for the selection and technical-economic evaluation of alternatives of exclusion and/or management of sand during drilling; completion and production, which including probabilistic risk analysis. The following case studies are presented in this article: Application of the methodology SEM Evaluation and implementation of sand exclusion and management technologies Chemical Consolidation (Laboratory) Chemical Treatment (Laboratory – Oil field) Screen Less Frac (Oil field) Artificial Lift Experiences With Sand Production Acoustic Monitoring Geomechanics applied to reduce risk of sanding during drilling, completion and production Design and Implementation of Software Tool Finally, conclusions and recommendations obtained in this study are shown.

AB  - AbstractThe field is a ‘turtle back' structure bound by a major wrench fault to the north and a salt withdrawl pod to the south. The reservoirs are high net to gross aeolian sands from the Cambrian (Amin) overlain by Permian glacial deposits (Al Khlata) with a high degree of heterogeneity. A combination of high viscosity oil and an extremely strong aquifer makes this field challenging. Early water breakthrough has traditionally been explained by rapid water coning, but recent data from under-balanced drilling operations highlighted that fractures do indeed play a role. This study aimed to explain whether this was a local phenomenon or a field wide characteristic, based on borehole image logs, openhole logs and production data from 16 horizontal and 15 vertical wells.Faults/fracture corridors and dispersed fractures have no correlation to BSW (bulk water saturation) or gross production rates. However, wells with mud losses always produce at high BSW or have rapid water breakthrough. Recent data from under-balanced drilling operations also highlighted that fractures might play a role because significant water influx was focused within narrow intervals. This apparent dilemma is resolved by noting that mud losses were reported only from a small fraction of wells, suggesting only a small fraction of faults are fluid conductive. Contrary to faults and fracture corridors, mega- fractures (large conductive fractures) have some correlation to BSW rate of increase. A possible explanation is that most fractures are clusters of shear fractures filled with sand and clay gouge, whereas some mega- fractures are opening mode fractures. It is not possible, however, to distinguish the opening mode fractures from gouge filled fractures from borehole image logs. In general fractures seem to play a minor role in water breakthrough because most fractures are not fluid conductive.It appears that spud date is probably the main factor related to rapid BSW rise with recent wells being more prone to rapid water breakthrough. Other factors such as pump type, depth to FWL, and distance between wells also have some effect on BSW rise. IntroductionFractures as a possible cause of early water breakthrough was studied previously by several authors. Watts1 initially suspected that early water breakthrough in many of the recently drilled rapid deployment wells in the Field and the fields to the west was caused by fractures. This appeared to be confirmed by cores of well a vertical well which showed clear evidence of open faults/fractures, particularly below oil water contact. Despite the fracture indications in core,Watts[1] concluded that although the rapid water breakthrough in the Field was unexpected, recent more refined single well radial coning models appear able to history match most wells prior to close-in. His results reveal extremely low Kv/Kh ratios for high water cut Al Khlata wells which suggest fractures to be closed in situ.Newberry[2] analysed image logs of a horizontal well and observed that although 86 open /partially open fractures have been identified, they do not appear to be influencing production. He concluded that although the well is located in an area of high fracture density, the fractures are of limited extent and do not connect the wellbore to the aquifer. In a follow up report[3] on a vertical well, he reached a similar conclusion. Although he identified some 143 open and partially open fractures, they did not appear to be influencing production.

AB  - Abstract Poly(vinyl sulfonate) (PVS) is an effective scale inhibitor in preventing the formation of barium sulfate. However, the low adsorption of PVS onto the rock results in a short squeeze treatment lifetime in reservoir. The application of nano-sized polyelectrolyte complexes (PECs) to increase the treatment lifetime of PVS is examined in this work. Positively charged nanoparticles consisting of poly(ethyleneimine) and PVS were prepared. Sand pack studies were performed to quantify the adsorption and release of PEC-entrapped PVS, and the effect of ionic shock on the release of PEC-entrapped PVS was studied. It was found that an increase in the ionic strength of the displacing fluid released the PVS from the nanoparticle structure. Dynamic tube blocking tests showed that PEC-entrapped PVS increases the squeeze treatment lifetime by 22% compared to unentrapped PVS. The results also suggest that ionic shocks improve the release of PVS, prolonging the treatment by 40% compared to unentrapped PVS.

AB  - SPE and IADC Member AbstractPremature failures in drill pipe have plagued the drilling industry for a long time. These failures usually occur within two feet of the box and pin tool joints. Previous work has shown that most of these failures are the result of an abrupt internal taper (1/2" - 1-1/2" long) (12.7 - 38.1mm) and slip damage. New long taper upset designs have helped solve this fatigue problem. This paper discusses a new stress relief tool joint that greatly enhances the benefits of the new, long taper upset by almost doubling the fatigue life. IntroductionFatigue failures in drill pipe are caused by cyclic bending stresses. These stresses are concentrated in the thin wall section of the drill pipe where the thick upset blends into the tube. I believe drill pipe today is being subjected to higher and higher stresses with the advent of top drives, deeper wells and higher angle holes. This condition is further agitated by a more hostile environment with the increasing presence of H2S, CO2 and brine water. Therefore, I believe everything possible should be done to improve the fatigue life of drill pipe. Both the long taper upset and the new stress relief tool joint will help accomplish this. REVIEW OF PROBLEMS AND PREVIOUS TEST WORK I think the problem of drill pipe fatigue has been sufficiently defined. Many drilling contractors and oil operators along with the IADC and API have made studies of a vast number of failures, and most all of them pointed to an abrupt upset along with slip damage as being the problem. It has also been observed that rapid deterioration of the internal, plastic coating in this area compounds the problem. P. 893^

AB  - Abstract The oil and gas industry is faced with uncertainty in many activities. Whereas in many of its areas, such as finance, geology and reservoirs these uncertainties are already incorporated in the modelling and studies. This is not the reality when it comes to modelling artificial lift and multiphase flow. Studies related with uncertainties in oil and gas production are limited. Therefore, this paper aims to develop a methodology to identify and quantify uncertainties, obtaining thus more accurate data to be used in production modelling. In addition, the methodology intends to evaluate oil production forecasting considering uncertainty propagation in oil flow simulation software. This study was divided in statistical analysis and production forecasting. An algorithm using R software analyzed and treated production data. It was applied statistical modelling techniques to data series. Deviations from these data were adjusted to a continuous distribution that provides the parameters to be used by Monte Carlo simulation method to generate random values to be input uncertainties of the MARLIM multiphase flow simulator. Oil flow rate, as output simulator, was adjusted to a new distribution and finally the intervals of occurrence probabilities of oil flow rate forecasts. This methodology was applied to BSW (Basic Sediments and Water) data from a representative field, showing the importance of including uncertainty analysis in order to generate greater reliability and accuracy in the production flow modeling. In conclusion, the method presented excellent results when applied to BSW.

AB  - Abstract The three-phase water-assisted flow of heavy crude oil with free gas (air) in a vertical glass pipe, at near atmospheric pressure and temperature conditions, is investigated, for possible applications to the articial lift of heavy oil. Water is injected so as to avoid oil-wall contact and reduce friction. The oil phase was a w/o emulsion with a viscosity of 5,040 mPa.s and a density of 971 kg/m3. For each combination of oil-water-gas flow rates, the flow pattern was determined using a high speed camera and the pressure gradient was measured with a differential pressure transducer. The results are presented in the form of flow maps based on superficial velocities and total pressure gradient plots, allowing comparisons with well known correlations. The main conclusion indicates the great viability of the water-assisted flow technique. Significant amounts of heavy oil have been discovered in offshore Brazil.IntroductionHeavy oils are often defined as those having densities greater than 934 kg/m3 (<20 oAPI) and viscosities in the range 100-10,000 mPa.s at reservoir conditions of pressure and temperature [1]. They represent a significant part of the Brazilian oil reserves, which, according to the National Petroleum Agency (2002), are approximately 3.2 billion oil barrels and mostly located offshore. The exploitation of these reserves, with the usual recovery and artificial lift technologies tends to be economically unattractive or unfeasible, which is partly due to the lower market value of heavy oils. However, with the progressive decline of light oil production, the importance and, consequently, the price of these fossil energy sources will tend to increase.The use of long horizontal length wells has been proposed to achieve high productivities but the injection of water in the reservoir tends to be not efficient, due to the unfavorable mobility difference between water and heavy oil [2]. Furthermore, in offshore deepwater fields, flow assurance problems such as hydrate, asphaltene and paraffin deposition risks indicate the need for improved thermal insulation and/or heat addition to the production line. However, water is readily available and its injection in liquid form requires low energy consumption.The artificial lift method for heavy oils is also critical especially in offshore deepwater applications since the conventional PCP technology does not provide high enough flow rates and ESPs require high power to overcome increased frictional flow losses of heavy oil or w/o emulsions. Refinery requirements include removal of nearly all the water present in the emulsion.This paper focuses the vertical upward three-phase pipe flow of heavy oil, air and water at several different combinations, in which water is injected to work as the continuous phase (water-assisted flow). A laboratory scale apparatus was built allowing flow pattern visualization and pressure drop measurement. Results are compared with some well-known oil and gas correlations and may be useful in either case when water is injected in the reservoir and forms a continuous phase in the production pipeline (BSW > 50 %), or when it is injected at pump exit, as in the oil-water "core flow" method [3-5]. No previous work on vertical three-phase oil-water-gas flow has been found.Experimental Setup and ProcedureThe experiments were conducted in the setup shown in Figure 1, at the School of Mechanical Engineering of the State University of Campinas. The apparatus consisted of a separator tank, individual lines and pumping systems for water, oil and air, which joined at an injector nozzle, followed by a 2.84 cm i.d., 2.5 m long vertical glass tubing for the three-phase flow. The oil flow rate was measured with a Coriolis mass flow meter, whereas the water and air flow rates were read in rotameters. Pressure data in the test section were measured with differential and absolute pressure transducers connected to a data acquisition system.

AB  - Abstract Alkaline Surfactant Polymer (ASP) flooding was identified as a potential field development option for a clastic field in Southern Sultanate of Oman. Extensive laboratory studies and field tests have been conducted to evaluate and mature this development option. Core floods showed that ASP can recover more than 90% of the oil remaining after waterflood resulting in remaining oil saturation below 5%. Simulation studies showed that ASP can potentially increase the field recovery factor by more than 20% over waterflood or 10% over polymer flood. A successful ASP single-well tracer test (SWCTT) and a micro-pilot in this field validated the laboratory results, confirmed the significant desaturation by ASP and the low residual oil saturation after ASP. The potential size of the prize for ASP flooding in this field alone is significant. Upon further evaluation of ASP as a development option, significant risks and uncertainties associated with implementing ASP at field scale were identified. An ASP continuous injection pilot was designed with well-defined objectives to reduce the risks and to quantify the uncertainties. In this pilot, the ASP process was evaluated in one of the main producing zones in the flank of the field utilizing a small (75m × 75m or 1.4 acres) inverted 5-spot pattern with a total of 7 wells (4 producers, 1 injector, 1 observation well, and 1 sampling well). The short injector-to-producer distance enabled a quick response and ensured completion of the field trial within one year at the target injection rate. The pilot was commissioned in Q1 2014 with water pre-flush to establish a waterflood baseline. Injection of the 0.3 PV ASP-slug started in February 2016, followed by 0.9 PV of polymer and a water post flush that was concluded in December 2016. A custom-built surface facility was constructed to mix and inject the required chemicals and to assess and treat produced fluids through a specialized flow loop. Dedicated Multi Phase Flow Meters (MPFM) were deployed at each producing well to provide accurate phase rates to quantify ASP incremental oil volumes. Detailed chemical analyses of injected and produced fluids were conducted throughout the pilot execution. Desaturation assessments were carried out through detailed surveillance activities in the dedicated logging observation well that involved a comprehensive suite of logs and evaluation tools, including time-lapse Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR) for saturation monitoring that were used for the first time in the field. The pilot achieved stable and safe operations with good injectivity, uptime, accurate chemical dosing, sampling and analysis as well as detailed surveillance. It recovered a significant incremental volume of oil above waterflood from decline curve analysis vs. a target of 20%, hence doubling the recovery as achieved with waterflood. Significant water cut reversal (25% - 30%) in producers and 31% reduction in oil saturation in the observation well due to ASP were observed by the time lapse NMR data. No injectivity issues were encountered with 50cP ASP and polymer chase. No scale was encountered during pilot period due to the successful and early deployment of scale inhibitor. The pilot produced saleable quality oil, free from emulsion with negligible increase in BSW over waterflood. This paper re-iterates the pilot objectives and design, summarizes the pilot results, including well performance, chemical analysis and surveillance data, surface facility performance during pilot execution, and the dynamic simulation and analysis of the pilot performance.

AB  - ABSTRACT Leaks in pipelines give rise to hydraulic parameters changing with the time at inlet and outlet. This fact leads to a new method of finding leaks. After the leaks present, inlet discharge increases abruptly comparing with the steady flow situation, whereas inlet pressure, outlet discharge and pressure decrease abruptly. Thus, the theory of abrupt change is used to on-line detect the abrupt points of hydraulic parameters at inlet and outlet of the pipeline to detect leak. The presence of abrupt points indicates there are leaks in pipelines. The technique has been successful in detecting leaks from a laboratory pipeline. INTRODUCTION Long-distance pipeline, one of the most important transportation means, has been widely utilized around the world. However, leak in pipelines often occurs owing to different reasons, which causes much larger economic loss and environmental destruction. Therefore, it is necessary to study the leak detection methods to minimize damage. The researchers have developed many leak detecting methods during the past of a few years. Developed detecting methods are divided into two groups: direct leak detection methods and hydraulic methods. Direct leak detection methods are including the observational method, pig-based leak detection method, acoustic leak detection method etc. Hydraulic methods are including reflected wave method, transient model method, mass balance method, pressure gradient method etc. Each of these methods for finding leaks has its advantages and disadvantages in different circumstances. However, traditional methods are not suitable for the long-distance pipeline due to their expensive price, difficult maintenance and the influence on normal running, etc. especially, the random characteristics of hydraulic parameters causes a large error. So, a statistical analysis method is introduced in this paper for the purpose of minimizing the error. That is the motivation of this paper.

AB  - Asphaltene accumulation in porous media is considered a formation damage issue, which may happen during miscible flooding processes, EOR or even primary production, and this may have deep effects on oil production. Although asphaltene precipitation is widely known in literature, the works related to asphaltene accumulation in porous media are rather limited. This work consists in an experimental quantification of asphaltene accumulation in porous media, and a numerical simulation of this process. An experimental methodology was developed in order to recreate asphaltene accumulation on laboratory, using synthetic cores and stock tank oil samples from two different Colombian fields.  This methodology consists in determinate basic properties (API, BSW, % asphaltenes), precipitation onset (using n-heptane as a precipitating agent) and perform core floodings at constant rates, these displacement tests showed damage due to asphaltenes between 18% and 27%.. The numerical model was developed using Simulink tool, from MATLAB. This model was validated with the experimental results, obtaining a satisfactory agreement, with relative errors between this data less than 5%. Different regimes of accumulation were observed, varying flooding rate. Besides modeling permeability reduction, the model was able to evaluate other variables in the accumulation process.

AB  - ABSTRACTA 0.1-m ID acrylic pipe, with four 36-inch radius 90 ° sweep, clear PVC bends test facility has been constructed to allow for visualization of flow characteristics in hilly terrain and topographies with short elevation changes. The height of the riser and crossing length is 5 meters. A detailed visualization of multiphase flow regimes and flow characteristics using water-carbon dioxide mixtures has been carried out. Visual observations of enhanced turbulence regions were noted and characteristics were noted at different velocities for nine locations along the system. ER probes are used to monitor corrosion rates in the first two bends where elevated turbulence was noted. Corrosion rates observed in the bends are compared to previous rates recorded in horizontal pipelines under similar operating conditions.INTRODUCTIONPetroleum production and drilling has steadily moved offshore and now involves production from mature wells with multiphase oil/water/gas mixtures occurring in flowlines with water cuts as high as 90%. The gas contains carbon dioxide, which dissolves in the seawater to form carbonic acid. Owing to the large distances and volumes of the fluid involved, the material of choice for construction of transportation lines is carbon steel. Acid along with the multiphase flow causes severe internal corrosion of the steel. At the flow conditions needed to remain profitable, the multiphase mixture experiences slug flow, a pattern similar to hydraulic jumps seen in tidal bores. This involves highly turbulent liquid with large amounts of entrained gas moving down the pipeline at high velocity. As a result of continued corrosion, a corrosion product layer will be formed on the metal wall surface. The product layer can protect the pipe wall from further corrosion, by preventing the electrolyte from reaching the corroded steel. However, in slug flow the turbulent nature of the flow strips away the corrosion product layer leaving the electrochemical reaction rate unchecked by the normal decrease in mass transfer associated with the deposition of corrosion product layer. Investigation into the mechanism of carbon dioxide corrosion on carbon steel under different conditions of pH, temperature, pressure and oil-water fractions have been carried out in the past. Bockris et al. (1962) 1 showed that the rate-controlling step depended upon the pH. The overall reaction is given by:Fe + H2CO 3 ~ FeCO 3 + H 2 (1)Sun and Jepson (1992) 2, Vuppu and Jepson (1994) 3, Jepson (1994) 4 and Gopal et al. (1995) 5 among others have shown that slug flow involves unique corrosion mechanisms with pulses of bubbles collapsing on the metal surface. The turbulent intensity of a slug is measured using the Froude number. The higher the Froude number, the higher the wall shear stress is within the slug (Zhou and Jepson, 1993) 6 . This severely enhances corrosion. Changes in elevation and hilly terrain encountered over the miles of pipeline needed to reach the separation station produce localized flow-dependent corrosion. It has been shown by Wilkens (1997) 7 that a change in elevation as low as one degree can cause the transition from stratified flow to the highly turbulent slug flow. Studies on the effect of slug frequency on corrosion rates in inclined pipes were carried out by Kang et al. (1997) 8. Vertical flow has also been studied and the flow characteristics that predominate are extreme slugging, slug and churn flow (Schmidt et al., 1981) 9. Extreme slugging occurs when there is a declined entrance to a vertical riser. Liquid backs up the pipeline until the back pressure of the gas has enough force to overcome the head of the riser and a large slug of liquid travels

AB  - ABSTRACTAluminum and its alloys in water within a pH range of 4 to 9 exhibit passivity due to the formation of a compact, adherent protective film of aluminum oxide.1,2 The metal corrodes at low pH, forming Al,+3 and at high pH.2 However, the presence of chloride ions in the solution gives rise to breakdown of passivity with formation of two types of pitting, cathodic pitting and anodic pitting.3 This was also observed by the authors during anodic and cathodic polarization of aluminum in chloride solution within a certain pH range.4,5 Study of local pH change in region of the solution adjacent to the sample surface during polarization reflected that the cathodic passivity breakdown was associated with sudden, abrupt increase in local pH toward alkalinity.5 This was also observed by Gundersen and Nisancioglu.6 It was also seen that during cathodic polarization, conductivity of the bulk solution increases until it attains a maximum value at exactly the cathodic passivity breakdown potential, after which it starts decreasing.5 In the case of anodic polarization, an abrupt decrease of local pH toward acidity was noticed and a conductivity minimum of the bulk solution occurred near the anodic pitting potential.4 It is reported7 that for 18/8 stainless steel in acid solutions containing chloride ions, pitting potential has always been identical to PZC for various chloride concentrations. In the present investigation, attempts were made to search for any occurrence of PZC near the cathodic or anodic passivity breakdown potentials. This would probably help in better understanding the mechanisms of two different types of pitting.

AB  - This article, written by JPT Technology Editor Chris Carpenter, contains highlights of paper SPE 193658, “Tackling High Water Production in Oman South Fields With New Technology,” by Ayca Sivrikoz, Maria Jimenez Chavez, and Salim Buwaiqi, Petroleum Development Oman, prepared for the 2018 SPE International Heavy Oil Conference and Exhibition, Kuwait City, Kuwait, 10–12 December. The paper has not been peer reviewed. The subject field is one of the largest mature oil accumulations in the South Oman Salt Basin. Production and integrity issues have been challenging in recent years, manifesting in abnormal water cut with time. A multidisciplinary study concluded that this water-cut behavior was the result of naturally occurring fractures that are limited in length and not vertically extensive.  The proposed solutions included detecting fractures early using borehole imaging techniques and using elastomeric zonal isolation packers (EZIPs) in sealing as many fractures as possible. This completion method resulted in delayed water production and increased net present value by $2 to $3 million per well. Introduction Field N is a complex heavy-oil field in the north of the Sultanate of Oman. It produces heavy oil from more than 1,000 wells, 80% of which are horizontal; all wells penetrate sandstone reservoirs. Production from these reservoirs started from vertical wells in 1985, but the field-development plan recommended a strategy of horizontal wells targeting the topmost part of the sand reservoirs to avoid the predicted oil/water contact to deter possible early water breakthrough. The dynamic behavior of Field N is characterized by strong aquifer and is dominated by bottomwater drive. The study focused on the westernmost accumulation of Field N, called Field NG. From the time Field NG first came on production in 1984 until 2004, the water cut of the field gradually increased to 30% with an average of 20% initial water cut in this 20-year period. However, after 2004, the average initial basic sediment and water (BSW), or water cut, of new wells in the field jumped to 85%, and even wells that started with initially low BSW soon developed a very high water cut in 2–3 months. Through numerical simulation models calibrated with production history from Field N, it was observed that, if matrix conditions are assumed, water is unable to break through immediately at the start of production. Instead, for matrix reservoirs, 1–2 years are required before the water cut can reach 80%. High initial water cuts could only be explained by conductive features such as high-permeability streaks, fractures, and faults. The simulation models investigating the effect of fracture orientation on water development indicated that vertically nonextensive fractures had no influence on water production early on, thus demonstrating matrix-like behavior in the beginning. However, as cones developed and the water table rose with time, water was able to reach these short fractures, and therefore very high initial BSW was observed in new wells. To prove this concept, an extensive literature search—many authors have studied fractures as a possible cause of early water breakthrough—and data-mining study was conducted, which suggested the presence of fractures in the field.

AB  - Abstract Production data analysis (PDA) by using rate normalized pressure (RNP) and rate normalized pressure derivative (RNP’) is useful for transient rate and pressure analysis of shale gas wells with constant or smooth changing gas rate and pressure. However, some reasons may cause abrupt changes, fluctuation, or even loss of production data. The existing PDA methods can not well address this kind of issue. The paper analyzes the reasons that cause big changes of shale gas production rate and pressure. The reasons include well-interference, well shut-ins, and converting production from casing to tubing. Typical shale gas well cases in China are described. Three methods are proposed to address the non-smooth production data issue. For shale gas wells with severe well-interference from neighbouring fracturing wells or production wells, the segmented production data before well-interference is suggested as well-interference is like an imposed negative or positive force from outside, and this force disturbs the normal production performance only rely on the well's own energy. For wells with frequent shut-ins, a virtual equivalent time method is referenced. The process for this method firstly calculates the formation pressure distributions and the average formation pressures within the SRV area; sencondly, calculate the virtual equivalent time by use of the average formation pressure; thirdly, divided the whole production data into several interconnected segments by rearrange the vitual euivalent time into the actual time axis, and finally do the analysis by using the log-log plot of pressure and pressure derivate vs material balance time. For shale gas wells with converting production from casing to tubing, as there are abrupt rate and pressure changes at the converting point, the material balance time may be no more monotonically increasing with production time. We proposed the average material balance time method to solve this problem. For this method, we use average material balance time instead of the material balance time in the log-log plot of pressure and pressure derivative. Results shows that severe well-interference cause big disturblance and only data before well-interference is suggested for PDA. Both the PDA with average material balance time and PDA with virtual equivalent time can get much better match of production history and log-log plot of pressure and pressure derivative then the exsiting PDA method.

AB  - Abstract Well performance evaluation and prediction via decline curve analysis (DCA) requires defined abandonment conditions (Abandonment BSW and oil rate) to estimate the developed ultimate recovery (DUR) of a drainage point. Abandonment BSW and oil rate are derived from well models which require abandonment reservoir pressure and Gas-oil-ratio (GOR) among others as inputs.Good understanding of the performance of a reservoir is necessary for the prediction of abandonment GOR, and this prediction requires a systematic approach. The assumed value of producing GOR has a direct impact on the magnitude of the hydrostatic and dynamic  pressure loss in a production tubular and hence it is a very important parameter in the vertical lift performance of a well. Similarly, the the reservoir pressure at abandonment is an indication of the energy available from the reservoir for lift hydrocarbon fluids from the bottom of the producing wells. This paper illustrates the methodology employed for the estimation of abandonment reservoir pressure,GOR and BSW in support of well performance evaluation and reservoir management. Case studies for saturated and undersaturated reservoirs with weak-to moderate aquifers are considered.   Introduction Estimation of Developed Ultimate Recovery (DUR) of producing drainage points can be carried out by any of the following methods - by Decline Curve Analysis (DCA), volumetric estimation, Material balance analysis, application of analogue techniques and numerical reservoir simulation. DCA technique requires abandonment conditions (abandonment BSW and oil rate) for estimation of DUR for any drainage point. Abandonment BSW and oil rate are derived from well models which require abandonment reservoir pressure and GOR among other inputs. This paper discusses in detail the abandonment pressure and GOR estimation methodology, resources and data requirements. Consideration has been given here to initially undersaturated reservoirs with moderate-to weak aquifer drive and saturated reservoirs with moderate-to weak aquifer drive.   Data Requirement and QA/QC Accurate estimates of abandonment pressure and GOR will depend largely on the quantity and quality of data available. Initial pressure data from pressure surveys at the onset of production from the reservoir (MDT, FIT, Static BHP e.t.c), BHP surveys carried out in the course of production from the reservoir, fluid sample data (PVT), production data, well logs, correlation panels, fluid distribution plots, e.t.c are essential data required for the estimation. Quality checks must be carried out on the available dataset to establish validity of the data points. This is because unusable/incomplete data may lead to erroneous analysis and conclusions.

AB  - Abstract Many things can cause rapid transients in gas pipelines, such as the sudden shutdown of compressors, or the abrupt changes in flow rate due to leaks. The hydraulic simulation of these rapid transients requires a mathematical model capable of modelling the detailed rarefaction wave. This also enables the accurate analysis of the impact of sequential valve closures along the pipeline. To minimize potential flow interruptions the highly accurate modelling of the pipeline dynamics can be used to understand and tune the behavior of the automatic shutdown valve (SDV’s). By simulating the pipeline behavior, offline analysis can be performed in a safe environment without interrupting pipeline operations. Automatic shutdown valves are designed to automatically close mainline valves in the case of a major pipeline leak or rupture to minimize pipeline leakage. Calibrated to detect a sudden pressure differential drop between a reference reservoir and the pipeline, automatic shutdown valves can respond to more than just pipeline leaks. Improper actuation of the line break mechanisms during pipeline operations can result in unwanted interruption of the pipeline flow if the calibration is not optimized. This paper discusses the pipeline behavior during the transient, the dynamic effects on the automatic shutdown valves, and covers an analysis of first and second order mathematical solvers. The results of the simulations are validated throughout with a comparison with field test measurements. Introduction A piping system is the most common method for transporting fluids between two locations. There are many challenges in the safe transportation of fluids in pipeline systems, particularly during rapid transients. The use of mathematical models to simulate these rapid transients makes pipeline operations safer. Mathematical models enable detailed analysis of transients following sudden compressor shutdowns, and abrupt flow rate changes caused by leakages. This detailed analysis provides an understanding of the behavior of the rarefaction wave as it propagates from the source of the change.

AB  - We propose a new time-lapse impedance difference inversion method of post-stack with higher accuracy and efficiency. Starting from forward model, we further derive the forward formula of the difference data and take advantage of the Bayesian framework. Meanwhile, the introduction of differential Laplace blocky constraint can further improve the accuracy of inversion. Compared with traditional simultaneous inversion method, this new method has high resolution, outstanding numerical stability and great adaptability for abrupt boundary. The test results of synthetic data and field data demonstrate the validity and accuracy of the new difference inversion method with differential Laplace blocky constraint.

AB  - Abstract Accurate torque and drag (T&D) analysis is a fundamental well planning tool essential for predicting and preventing drilling and completion problems. To guarantee an efficient and safe operation, tension/compression and torque on the bottom hole assembly needs to be controlled within acceptable limits. Practically all available torque and drag software can calculate the following general operation modes: rotating off-bottom, pick-up, slack-off, rotary drilling and oriented drilling modes. However in the well construction process, there are many other complex operational modes that are largely absent from available software systems, as discussed in the literature. The industry requires modeling methodology to analyze complex well operations including: setting and un-setting packers, anchoring liner hangers, shearing pins in wellbore departure operations, loading and operating drilling/fishing jars in both overpull and compression. The authors will discuss new modeling software capable of analyzing complex well operations including liner hanger and jarring operations in detail. Further discourse about how modeling these special operations were combined with field experience and confirmed the accuracy of the new module with regards to both special operations and conventional T&D capabilities. The simulation/analysis recommendations were successfully executed in the field and led to increased operational efficiency and unplanned cost avoidance. Case studies will be presented of successful liner hanger deployment and complex drilling jar simulation. Introduction Torque and drag (T&D) analysis has been a subject of research for several years. The objective is to predict and prevent drilling and completion problems before they occur [1-10]. This type modeling is becoming more critical with the advancement of techniques that include extended reach drilling (ERD), high temperature high pressure (HTHP) applications and complex wellbore geometries. Designing a safe and efficient bottom hole assembly (BHA) and casing/liner plan is important in these operating conditions to deliver operator-driven wellbore/casing requirements and keep project costs within budget (AFE). For example, when the BHA tripped into a highly deviated wellbore some parts of the drillstring are in tension while others are in compression. To ensure an efficient operation, engineers must strike a workable balance between tension in the pipe/connection while holding compression within the string's buckling force limit and minimize torque on the surface drive system. Drag force is attributed to the friction between the drillstring and the borehole wall when moving the BHA through the existing wellbore. In a simple model, drag is the increased/decreased apparent hook-load when tripping plus the observed rotating hook-load at the equivalent depth. The driller's hook-load gauge is the only measure of the combination of these downhole dynamics. Additionally, buoyed drilling fluid weight and BHA contact forces against the hole wall all affect the boundary condition of available weight and/or torque at a particular tool of interest (TOI).

AB  - Abstract An innovative methodology using a new bottomhole flow measurement tool and distributed temperature surveying was used to treat two openhole carbonate water injectors using coiled tubing (CT) equipped with fiber optics. The system capabilities were leveraged to control, in real time, the dual injection process and ensure that the treatment covered the entire horizontal section. The new level of efficiency of this approach was proven in the outstanding results of this stimulation campaign. The method takes advantage of the fiber optics present in a CT string to acquire, in real time, both downhole flow measurements and distributed temperature surveys to identify areas of higher and lower injectivity along the wellbore. It also enables clear and rapid evaluation of the depth to the level that bullheaded fluid would normally reach downhole. The real-time flow measurement is further used to optimize the stages of the treatment that aim at placing fluid across the interval initially poorly covered, as it gives direct feedback of the efficiency of the pumping through the annulus and CT. Matrix stimulation in water injector wells is often handled in a straightforward way by simply bullheading the treatment from surface. Used within the context of horizontal or highly deviated openhole wells, this frequently leads to an overstimulation at the casing shoe or along the first part of the zone of interest, and a significant section of wellbore is poorly covered or even remains untreated. The new approach not only enables visualizing where the treatment fluid goes, it also gives a new level of control of downhole injection, in real time. This new capability was taken advantage of within the context of long horizontal openhole water injectors, whose previous stimulation treatments left untouched a significant portion of the reservoir, even when complementing bullheading by the placement of treatment fluid with CT. The methodology enabled clear identification of which pumping method was beneficial to which interval. It also proved very efficient, leading to an increase in the injectivity index of the wells of nearly threefold, beyond the expectations based on previous stimulation interventions. The new downhole flow measurement tool and its use within this innovative workflow address many limitations usually encountered during the stimulation of horizontal or highly deviated openhole water injectors. In particular, the approach enables taking full advantage of the dual injection process, which often proves difficult to control and optimize in real time. The end result is an unprecedented level of efficiency of the process.

AB  - Abstract In recent past, most of Brazil's oil production was generated from siliciclastic reservoirs in scenarios of deep and ultra-deep water of the Campos Basin, being much effort focused on developing technologies to guarantee production optimization. Despite the great experience acquired by Petrobras in evaluating dynamic behavior of deepwater fields, new production scenarios of heavy oil reservoirs are even more challenging due to their high oil viscosity that generates emulsion stability. Jubarte field (siliciclastic turbidite reservoir) development features 15 heavy oil producing wells tied to P-57 floating production storage and offloading (FPSO) vessel. Each well is equipped with a 1500HP electrical submersible pump (ESP) installed in a caisson located 210 meters away from the wellhead in water depths varying from 1260 to 1360m. Over the last 3 years, since Jubarte first oil, the maturity curve of the wells has revealed a scenario where ESP has been recognized as a critical component of the subsea production system to sustain well production. Normally adopted in projects to anticipate production during the early years, ESPs in Jubarte field have been presenting an outstanding performance, overcoming oil viscosity limitations or unpredictable multiphase flow regime with strong emulsion formation (both tied to injection of viscosity reducers and the advent of natural free water from the reservoir). Operating ESPs installed at the seabed poses challenges in many aspects. Understanding the flow pattern (to ensure effective startup and run in optimal conditions), pump and caisson fluid dynamic behavior (to allow the pump ride through some observed inflow discontinuities) are two essential issues. This work aims to introduce the phenomenon of flow intermittency experienced during the operation of ESPs installed in vertical caissons in Jubarte field. It also demonstrates the engineering approach and the main proposed solutions to overcome the problem of well instability. The advantages obtained through the injection of demulsifier upstream the ESP are finally presented as a key element to promote stability, allowing ESP to run properly with significant gains in production rate.

AB  - Abstract The development of carbonate reservoirs using peripheral and pattern water flooding typically achieves oil recovery factors ranging from 0.3 to 0.5, which is due to some complicating factors, such as, oil-wet surface of the pore space or the surface with intermediate type of wetting, unfavorable ratio of oil and water viscosities, presence of extensive structure of fractures, and significant variations of permeability down the reservoir section. In a complex geological environment, wells display abrupt fluctuations of water production that is an evidence of formation water being by no means the most efficient displacement agent. In these conditions, low-salinity water flooding can improve oil recovery. This paper reports on SCAL results of oil recovery factor determination and spontaneous imbibition using water with different composition and total solinity for Object 2 of Kharyaga oil field. Also, report contains design of on-site determination of residual oil saturation using Single Well Chemical Tracer test technology for evaluation of EOR efficiency. Laboratory tests showed, that low-salinity Jurassic water flooding with total salinity about 5 g/l could rase recovery factor up to 4% and also give incremental recovery due to effects of spontaneous imbibition for permability lower than 100 mD, which makes the injection of Jurassic water more preferable.

AB  - AbstractIntegrated field and well reviews followed by logical activities are being taken to address the voidage and declining pressure in Yibal. This is to ensure that target daily oil rates are achieved, and UR is maximized, in the largest oil producing asset in Oman, which delivers almost 15% of the total country production from a heavily faulted and fractured carbonate anticlinal structure, on stream since 1969. Water injection initiated in 1972 has gone through a series of stages; vertical oil phase injectors for lateral sweep, vertical aquifer injection for vertical sweep and later some horizontal deep aquifer injectors. The injection serves the dual purpose of pressure management and produced water disposal. The field has suffered negative voidage for quite some time, leading to rapid reservoir pressure depletion. Past studies have identified uneven vertical and lateral sweep due to uneven subsurface water distribution as a result of the complicated fracture and fault patterns as well as the subsurface hydro-dynamics and flow mechanisms. This has left the remaining oil in pockets that are becoming more difficult to produce. The high field average BSW has led to a situation where oil wells are closed in for surface facilities constraint and, or subsurface water injection capacity. Further, the uncertain water movement into producing wellbores makes production optimization activities risky. Recently, quite a number of injectors have been taken offline for integrity repairs and are only gradually coming back on stream after extensive and often expensive repairs.The implementation of a voidage replacement program which includes understanding the reservoir dynamics, identification of the worst hit low pressure areas, and prioritization of the short, medium and long term remedial activities is on going. Increased focus on gross offtake management, injection well stimulation, water shut off in producers, conversion of poor producers to injectors, and drilling of new injectors is showing returns in flattening of the decline rate of oil production. The issues around water injection as well as oil producer integrity are gradually being addressed. Several learning points for the implementation of the proper reservoir and voidage management have also been captured. The importance of human resources both in terms of numbers, level of experience and skills set, has also been recognized and the optimum balance of these is being worked on.IntroductionThe Yibal field (Fig 1), discovered in 1963 and brought on stream in 1969, currently produces oil (from the Shuaiba reservoir) and gas (from the Natih reservoir). Both streams are managed by different Asset teams.

AB  - Abstract The Upper-Convected Maxwell (UCM)model has been normally used to describe the rheological properties of polymer solutions. However, this model considers only viscosity and elasticity of a fluid without including the non-Newtonian power law behavior, a very important property to polymer solutions in reservoirs. Therefore, we present a Modified Upper-Convected Maxwell (MUCM)in this paper to take into account this property. The steady flow mathematical model of MUCM fluids is established. The flow characteristics of viscoelastic fluids in the dead ends of porous pores in reservoirs are simulated numerically. The contours of velocity and stream function are drawn and micro-scale sweep efficiency is calculated quantitatively. The various regularities, corresponding to the change in visco-elastic properties of the fluid, are studied. Numerical results show the visco-elasticity of polymer solutions is the main factor influencing sweep efficiency. With increasing elasticity, the flowing area in the dead end of pores is enlarged significantly, thus the area with immobile zones becomes smaller. Flow velocity is much larger than that for a Newtonian fluid, the sweep area and displacement efficiency increase as theelasticityincreases. The visco-elastic nature of the displacing polymer fluids can in general improve the displacement efficiency in pores compared to using Newtonian fluids. This conclusion should be useful in selectingpolymer fluids and designing polymer flooding operations. Introduction In the process of water flooding alone, the residual oil remaining within porous media is difficult to be displaced or recovered. In comparison, polymer flooding, because of its favorable ratio in mobility between displacing and displaced fluids, is more effective. Experimental results indicated the visco-elasticity of polymer solutions can enhance the displacement efficiency, but there are few theoretical studies on this subject. Polymer flooding is one of the most important chemical flooding processes. It has long been believed that one mechanism of polymer flooding in enhancing oil recovery results from the viscolesticy of the polymer solutions. The viscoelastic fluid can improve the displacement efficiency, which has been proved byexperiments1,2. The viscoelastic HPAM (Hydrolyzed Polyacrylamide) solutions (concentration in series)and viscous glycerin solutions (no elasticity, viscosity in series) are studied by laboratory flooding at visual microscopic glass models and artificial cores3. The experimental results indicate that both the viscosity and the first normal stress differential of HPAM solution increase with the increase in viscoelasticity, and that the displacement efficiency is mainly related to the first normal stress differential of the fluid. For the past several years, numerical simulation of viscoelastic flows has been carried out to understand the viscoelastic fluid flow behavior in a variety of processes of both industrial and scientific interest. Polymeric fluids, owing to their viscoelastic character, are of particular interest to the numerical simulation community because of their wide applications in material processing and their different behavior from that of Newtonian fluids in ways which are often complex and strikingly different. There are many forms of residual oil in the reservoir, for example, oil droplet, oil film, oil trapped in dead ends, and so on. The configurations of residual oil existing within actual pores may be in many different forms and more complicated.In theoretical studies, for simplicity, these micro-pores are often simplified, for example, assuming an abrupt axisymmetric expansion, an abrupt axisymmetric contraction, micropore with dead ends, etc.Many numerical studies have focused on the viscoelastic flow through an abrupt axisymmetric expansion4 and contraction5,6.  Among them, the expansion model is a very typical model for studying the viscoelastic flows. To investigate micropores with dead ends a difference method is used in this paper. The model is easily implemented when the study area is regular. So the difference method is a simple and available method for solving mathematical and physical model in this paper.

AB  - Abstract The sedimentary environment in Casabe field is a complex continental-fluvial deposit conformed by numerous stacked sandstone reservoirs intercalated with shales with high lateral and vertical heterogeneity. In that conditions Casabe has been under Waterflooding for 30 years with successful results due to an efficient vertical and areal sweep achieved through selective injection. The successful in production increment also bring us a huge increment in produced water in a ratio of 1 BOPD to 6 BWPD. But, we notice that there where patterns with more than 90% of BSW in between of patterns below than 70% of BSW. Considering additional arguments evidence lead us to rethink our vertical distribution. With the water channeling identification in mind our reservoir surveillance process was adjust going further in layer by layer analysis from the production-injection balance and the pore volume displaced to get an indicator of where water is going in order to come with a general or localized solution. All the analysis required gather and integrate information from tools like inter well tracers, PLTs, swabbing by layers, saturation logs, time lapse resistivity logs, and cement logs where there was an opportunity to run the tools. After the identification of water recirculation (Bad Water) in zones with high permeability the immediate action to stop water recirculation and reduce produced water was blocking zones in 1) Producers: Water shut off and/or 2) Injectors. In the long term, a more comprehensive solution for water channeling will be Water Conformance as the saturation logs shows there is still oil in those layers. The results of the work done in 21 production wells was the reduction of produced water up to 300 BWPD per well achieving water cuts lower than 80%. Additionally and more important was the increment in oil production observed in the same wells as a consequence of vertical swept efficiency improved.

AB  - Hydraulic fracturing is the most common stimulation technique to make hydrocarbon production feasible and optimal worldwide. However, it has been preferentially focused on low permeability formations, and when applied to high permeability, it has been focused on sand control. This article outlines the process and results of the hydraulic fracturing campaign for productivity purposes (not for sand control) in the basin of the eastern plains of Colombia given the petrophysical characteristics of the cretaceous formations, where thinking "out of the box" and separating from the existing premises, resulted in successful implementation of this technique in high permeability wells (~ 1D), high water cuts (up to 80% BSW) and heavy oil reservoirs (9–12 API). The technical process consisted on several steps leading to the success of the campaign, which included: Formation damage study that identified candidate wells and damage mechanisms affecting them. Refining of the petrophysical model from pressure testing to establish incremental production. Adjustment of fracture models using varying anisotropy from special sonic log runs. Using state of the art technologies such as mobility enhancers and Flow back proppant additives as active ingredients of the fracturing fluid.   This article presents the outcomes of more than 40 wells intervened to date with an average volumetric increment of ~ 250 BOPD per well, consistent reductions of BSW up to 60% and optimized operations which let the operator consider the hydraulic fracturing as a production optimization option for the field under analysis.

AB  - Foamed cement operations require not only a better understanding of foam quality during placement, but also good control of nitrogen injection. This will ensure well security during placement and provide well integrity after placement. Real-time foam cementing process control system is capable of handling abrupt changes in the cement slurry pump rate which allows for the delivery of quality foamed cement with the designed proportions of gaseous nitrogen and surfactants. The system can also perform process controlled operations with more than 200 stages of varying nitrogen ratios to provide a near-constant density column of foamed cement in the wellbore. A Dynamic foamed cement placement simulator provides better understanding on the evolution of foam quality across the wellbore during the placement. The computations take into account the influence of circulating pressures and temperatures on nitrogen compressibility. The simulator then evaluates the computed surface and downhole pressures and foam qualities throughout placement and after cement is in place, and issues warnings whenever those parameters fall outside the design criteria at any time during the operation. Such feedback allows the engineer to adjust the design in order to meet the job objectives. The combination of these two technologies would effectively reduce the operational complexities on foamed cement jobs, which would substantially increase success rate and enhance well integrity assurance. Several case studies of foamed cement jobs performed in Gulf of Mexico are presented where the use of both real-time process control and dynamic placement simulations resulted in successful execution and proper cement placement.

AB  - ABSTRACTThe corrosion resistance of Alloy 22 (UNS No.: N06022) was studied in simulated ground water of different pH values and ionic contents at various temperatures, potentiodynamic polarization techniques were used to study the electrochemical behavior and measure the critical potentials in the various systems. Alloy 22 was found to be resistant to localized corrosion in the simulated ground waters tested. INTRODUCTIONThe environmental consideration of importance here are those pertaining to the design and construction of high-level radioactive waste packages (HLRWP) for the proposed Yucca Mountain Nuclear Waste Repository (YMNWR). As stipulated in the License Design Selection Report [1 ], the design of the HLRWP calls for a double walled canister (Figure 1). The proposed material for the outer barrier of the waste package is alloy 22 (Unified Numbering System (UNS) N06022), the corrosion resistant material (CRM). This material is expected to provide a reasonable level of "kinetic" immunity from general and localized corrosion for the HLRWP under the prevailing environmental condition of the proposed underground YMNWR so that there is a low rate of passive dissolution, and negligible chance of stabilization of localized corrosion for periods of time in excess of 10,000 years. The proposed material for the inner barrier of the waste package is stainless steel 316 (UNS $31603). The primary role of this layer is structural reinforcement. The composition of the ground water (well water) found at the proposed YMNWR site is described in Table 1. It is referred to as J-13 [2-4]. The water is so named because it was drawn from a well designated J-13 in the Nevada test site, located near the proposed YMNWR. The well draws from the same rock unit of the proposed site. J-13 is relatively benign to alloy 22 for electrochemical testing especially over short periods of time [5, 6]. For this reason, the test media used for investigations are simulated ground waters derived for the continuous cyclic wetting and drying process of J-13 expected under waste storage material conditions due to the heat anticipated from the radioactive decay of the waste material, and the constant dripping of the ground water onto the containers from pores in the surrounding rock [4]. However, this process is expected to occur after a significant drop in temperature as the heat generated initially is expected to keep the repository in a fairly dry state [7, 8]. Researchers at the Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory, LLNL prepared several versions of the simulated waters, concentrated to over 1000 times of J-13 in the acidic, near neutral and basic regimes for realistic electrochemical testing [3]. They include Simulated Acidified Water (SAW), with a pH o f - 2.8, Simulated Concentrated Water (SCW) with a pH of-8, and Basic Saturated Water (BSW) with a pH of-13. Compared with other nickel (Ni) alloys, relatively little experimental data on corrosion exists on alloy 22 because it is an alloy that is relatively new (-20 years old) [9]. The effects of temperature (25 to 200°C) and electrolyte composition (0.017M chloride concentration ([C1-]) to saturation) on the critical breakdown potentials for localized corrosion have been studied extensively on Ni alloys [10-22]. These studies show that an increase in temperature and [C1-] reduces the critical breakdown potential while an increase in concentration of alloying elements like tungsten (W), chromium (Cr) and molybdenum (Mo) increases these breakdown potentials. The synergy between Cr and Mo in resisting localized corrosion is particularly potent. Alloy 22 is more resistant to localized breakdown, and exhibits much lower corrosion rates compared with alloys like

AB  - AbstractThe concept of thin bed information resolution (TBIR) of well logs was first published by Yongxian Qian (1995; Acta Geophysica Sinica, v. 38, Supp. 1). The resolution of thin bed information is carried out by the Walsh Transforms (WT) inversion. NMR logging, among other logging tools, faces the issue of vertical resolution because the aperture of the tool is relatively large (about 24 in.); and the raw echoes acquired have to be stacked to some degree. Until now, WT inversion was not applied to NMR data, but its application to NMR data follows naturally as part of an effort to enhance its vertical resolution. As long as an application's response functions are of an averaging nature and its final products are results of a linear signal processing, WT inversion can be applied. The T2 distribution from NMR logging falls into this category of final products. Therefore, it is not necessary to start with the raw echoes and the complexity of the algorithms to achieve a higher vertical resolution can be reduced.After the brief review of Walsh functions, Walsh expansion and TBIR, this paper focuses on their application to NMR data. In order to demonstrate that WT inversion does improve NMR vertical resolution, controlled data were used. The best way to provide these data was through simulation; and the paper provides information about a simulation procedure for a layered formation and the NMR data derived from it. The results of WT inversion on the simulated NMR data clearly shows that vertical resolution is enhanced to a third of the simulated tool's aperture for the assumed logging conditions. WT inversion was also applied to the NMR data from a well in the southeastern part of the United States. These results show an improvement of NMR vertical resolution as illustrated by comparison of density porosity with NMR effective porosity before and after WT inversion. IntroductionTo improve the vertical resolution of logging tools is an old issue in the oil industry. Log analysts have proposed some approaches to increase the vertical resolution. To investigate the upper limit of resolution improvement, thin bed information resolution (TBIR) was published last year.1 TBIR employs Walsh function theory, linear system theory, and the response functions of logging instruments. About Walsh Functions and Walsh ExpansionWalsh functions consist of a complete set of orthogonal functions2 analogous to sines and cosines. They only assume the discrete values of 1 or -1. Figure 1 shows the first 16 members of Walsh function set. They are step functions in nature whose abrupt changes are reminiscent of the physical property changes in layered earth formations. Therefore, Walsh functions are better suited for describing the layered formation's petrophysical properties than, say sines and cosines functions3.

AB  - AbstractOpen Hole Drill Stem Tests (DIT's) are conducted with a drilling rig in open hole (hence the name). Total lest times are approximately twenty four hours while on bottom test times average six hours. The results of the tests are typically used to? ensure sufficient reservoir quality exists to justify running casing and conducting a completion program. However, there are many examples of DSTs that have yielded incorrect results and as a result DSTs are considered to be somewhat unreliable. The intent of this paper is to demonstrate a new approach that improves the reliability and accuracy of DST analysis.IntroductionA typical open hole DST consists of a 5-10 minute initial flow period, 60-90 minute initial shut-in period, and one hour main flow period and a two to four hour final shut-in period. The intent of the initial flow is to relieve the mud hydrostatic pressure that is trapped under the packers. The objective of the initial shut-in is to capture an initial reservoir pressure. The final flow withdraws a known quantity of reservoir fluid and creates a pressure transient into the reservoir. The final shut-in records the rate at which the reservoir pressure recovers in response to the reservoir fluid withdrawal. The final buildup is analyzed to determine the reservoir flow capacity and the deliverability potential of the reservoir.However, due to the short flow periods there are a significant number of open hole DSTs that recover very little, if any reservoir fluids. Subsequent analyses of these DSTs results in reservoir deliverability estimations that are significantly lower than the actual post completion results. In the past the explanation for these discrepancies has been that open whole DST's are unreliable. In fact, open hole DST's are reliable if they are analyzed for the correct fluid. If the formation is relatively tight or a lot of drilling mud filtrate has invaded the reservoir, all that will be recovered during the DST is mud filtrate. When the filtrate production rate is used in the test analysis, the discrepancy between the DST predictions and actual post completion results disappears.To demonstrate; this, a case study was done of three open hole DSTs and subsequent post fracture completion tests for the Montney reservoir in Northern Alberta.EXAMPLE #1 IMPERIAL MANIR 16-35--71-4W6M The downhole pressure plot for the Montney open hole DST on Manir 16-35-71-4W6 (attached as Figure I) illustrates the test sequence. An initial flow and shut-in were not conducted on this test in order to have a longer final shut-in (six hours). The flow period was one hour long and recovered minimal gas (less than 10 m3/d) and 0.176 m3 of drilling fluid. The downhole recovery recorder plot (attached as Figure 2) illustrates the fluid entry into the test string when the downhole valve was open. There is an abrupt fluid entry that occurs immediately after the test valve is opened (TVO). After that me rate of pressure increase continually decreases until the end of the flow period. When the test valve is closed (TVC) the pressure ceases to increase.

AB  - AbstractIn reservoirs with a thin oil rim below a gas cap, oil production can be severely hampered by gas coning or cusping problems. Oil production can be improved by means of in-situ generation of a gas-blocking foam barrier in the near wellbore area. Candidate wells in the Eastern Division of Shell Petroleum Development Company of Nigeria were selected for field testing Gas Shut-Off foam treatments on the basis of high Gas/Oil Ratios (GOR), low BSW, reserves availability etc. Laboratory tests were conducted to identify suitable foamer systems and construction of reservoir simulation models took place to estimate the potential of the treatments with respect to oil production and GOR reduction. Eight wells have been treated using two foamer systems and two different foam generation techniques. The results vary between a significant reduction in GOR for more than twelve months, i.e. from 7000 scf/bbl to 2000 scf/bbl at an increased oil rate from 340 to 450 bopd and treatments resulting in a minor GOR reduction for only a few weeks. It can be concluded that, on average the treatments have a 50+% success rate.P. 459

AB  - Abstract In this paper the authors report the vertical bending properties of a test chilled gas pipeline and the countermeasures of the bending. A full-scale field experiment of the chilled gas pipeline system was conducted in Fairbanks, Alaska from 1999 to 2005. The length of the test pipeline was 105m and the diameter was 0.9m. The circulated chilled air was –10°C. One-third of the pipeline was buried in frozen ground and the rest of it was placed in talik. At the end of July 2003, circulation of the chilled air ceased, however, monitoring of the thaw settlement-related properties of the test pipeline continued until the middle of April 2005. The following results were presented at the 2nd ATC: 1) As the frost-bulb around the pipeline in talik section formed, the test pipeline in the talik section moved upward, resulting in bending of the pipeline at the boundary. 2) In summers, frozen overburden soil of the pipeline became thinner due to thawing of active layer above. The pipeline buried in frozen section moved upward abruptly, fracturing the thinning frozen overburden ground. 3) The phenomenon mentioned in 2) occurred in successive summers, and the pipeline uplift in frozensection continued. 4) In relation with 1), the upward movement in talik section was confirmed by frost heaving of the pipe foundation. In this report the bending behavior of the test pipeline is described and the several methods to deal with the bending are proposed.

AB  - ABSTRACTOil production in offshore fields requires large investments and projects with high complexity. When it comes to subsea layout design, wells can be connected in several different ways. A common configuration employs manifolds, in which wells are grouped in drill centers, and manifolds gather their production through flowlines. The oil flow is then transported to the platform using a single riser, thus reducing the total length of pipelines since the wells are not individually connected to the platform. The advantage of using submarine manifolds is the reduction of costs associated with flowlines and risers installation. Besides that, the weight of the risers supported by the platform is also a limiting factor. Therefore decreasing the number of risers frees up balcony space and reduces weight requirements.The decision to use a manifold impacts well production. Oil flow from wells in the same drill center must reach the manifold at the same pressure, which may favor the production of some wells to the detriment of others due to each well's production parameters and proximity to the manifold. Thus, the present work aims to investigate the manifold's optimal position with maximum production as the end goal. Another factor to be investigated is the influence that the production parameters, such as BSW (basic sediments and water) and GOR (gas/oil ratio), have on the optimal manifold position. These parameters vary throughout the productive life of the wells; this study will also analyze how these changes impact the optimal position of the manifold when the total oil production for a certain time period is taken into account. This work will be conducted using an evolutionary algorithm to determine the optimal manifold position based on the oil production at each location. The oil flow will be calculated using a multiphase flow computer simulation running different scenarios with varying production parameters.

AB  - Summary Microseismic analysis is used to determine event locations, event strength, stress and energy release, and relative fracture lengths. Additionally, source mechanisms and their associated failure mechanisms are calculated for high-quality events using Seismic Moment Tensor Inversion. These microseismic observables are used together with the detailed hydraulic fracture treatment data to identify several dynamic changes in the growth of the discrete fracture network. In this study, we identify a preferred fracture set that is consistent with the regional stress and easily activated throughout the treatment program. A secondary fracture set is also observed but is only temporarily activated by increases in proppant mesh size. Abrupt changes in event rate, fracture plane orientation, source mechanism, and proximity to the treatment zone are linked to changes in the treatment program, such as mesh size, providing insight into the role and effectiveness of both fluid and proppant on extending the connected discrete fracture network.

AB  - ABSTRACT:The effects of loading histories on the stress-strain behaviour of an artificially soft rock, compacted cement-mixed well-graded gravelly soil, in multiple-step loading (ML) triaxial compression (TC) tests were evaluated. Associated with an increase in the strain until the peak stress state with an increase in the confining pressure (σh) in single-step loading (SL) TC tests, all the loading steps in ML tests increasing σh, loading was terminated consistently during strain-hardening approaching the peak stress state with volume contraction, On the other hand, associated with a decrease in the strain until the peak stress state with a decrease in σh in SL TC tests, in ML tests decreasing σh, at the first and second loading steps, loading had to be terminated far before the peak stress state during strain-hardening. At the third and subsequent steps, in particular at the last step, the stress-strain relation quickly entered into the strain-softening regime exhibiting large dilation while significant effects of damage by preceding loading steps were observed. A comparison of the pre-peak stress-strain relation at respective steps of the ML tests with those during SL TC tests revealed that the stress-strain behaviour in the ML tests is affected by; 1) stiffening by cyclic loading due to elastoviscoplastic properties; 2) effects of σh on the stress-strain behaviour; and 3) damage effects that have taken place during preceding loading history, in particular those by previous shearing into the strain softening regime and unloading causing large negative shear strains. The shear strengths at different σhs could be determined based on results from relevant ML tests using a single specimen. 1. INTRODUCTIONTo evaluate the Mohr-Coulomb failure criterion (the M-C failure criterion) by using a single undisturbed sample of soil or rock, multiple-step loading triaxial compression test (ML TC test) consisting of a series of consolidation and shearing steps has been employed [1-2]. A series of ML TC tests on undisturbed samples from a given site can provide a spatial variability of soil or rock strength represented by the M-C failure criterion. Despite the above, details of loading histories comprising a sequence of consolidation and TC loading/unloading at different confining pressures are usually poorly stated by different researchers. For example, Kim and Ko (1979) [5] reported only the relevance of a ML test method on the stress-strain property of a certain rock type. Akai et al. (1981) [6] found that, in a number of ML TC tests on siltstone and tuff, it often became difficult to continue TC loading, because, soon after the specimen state became near failure, the specimen exhibited abrupt post-peak strain-softening before increasing the confining pressure. They controlled the lateral strain during TC loading to avoid abrupt failure. However, effects of the details of the test procedure were not studied. In the studies by Cain et al. (1986) [7] and Crawford and Wylie (1987) [8], volumetric strain was used to detect imminent failure at respective TC loading steps in ML test. However, the effects of precedent loading histories were not reported.

AB  - Abstract Thermal recovery schemes are becoming increasingly common as many processes transition from trials and piloting to fully commercialized technologies. These processes often rely on high quality temperature and pressure data that are accurate and reliable over an extended period of time and at reservoir temperatures in excess of 180°C, potentially up to 300°C. Ideally, the number of discrete temperature measurement points in a well is maximized to decrease the possibility that temperature related events go undetected. This new approach is based on a thin, advanced, high temperature index polymeric insulation material which enables reliable Type-K thermocouples to be used. The development of the thermocouple pairs was based on fundamental material characterization, followed by lab and simulated-use testing. A customized two dimensional stationary thermal simulation tool was utilized to optimize efficiency in temperature response behavior of the cable design. It allowed for the modeling of a multipoint thermocouple bundle temperature profile under the influence of longitudinal and axial heat conduction. The combination of experimental testing and theoretical simulation created an architecture which offers the highest density of thermocouple points possible in standard stainless steel tubing sizes. Mechanical testing in combination with temperature exposure shows high temperature performance within cut-through and thermoplastic flow tests. The most critical potential failure modes relate back to these properties and could yield false temperature measurements at wrong locations. In addition, accelerated aging testing demonstrates insulation integrity with a temperature index of 300°C. Comparison measurement with standard available polymeric insulation shows a significant increase in reliability, achievable number of measurement points, and higher operating temperatures. Temperature simulation data show a high level of agreement to measured laboratory testing. A prototype cable has been installed in an observation well at Statoil's SAGD Leismer Demonstration Project by suspending the cable inside of the casing. This observation well intersects the active steam chamber; thus, the cable is exposed to high and ambient temperatures with an abrupt transition between the two zones. Standard mineral insulated (MI) Type-K thermocouples were previously clamped to the exterior of the casing and cemented in place. Field trial data will be presented demonstrating a high degree of correlation between the prototype cable thermocouples and the standard thermocouples over a significant period of time. Novel/Additive Information: The innovative, durable, thin, polymeric insulation material capable of operating up to 300°C, enables the use of thermocouples. A cable design utilizing this material is presented, which allows for a high density of temperature points. Well-operators can now rely on established Type-K thermocouples to provide high resolution data over the length of the well. For instance, over 60 points encapsulated in ½? tubing can be used to monitor the subcool of a SAGD well.

AB  - ABSTRACT:Flow visualization experiments were conducted on an unconfined vortex formed on a fixed impermeable plate. Altogether eight different forms of breakdown were observed; seven of which were similar to those found in a confined tube flow. The eighth form had a conical breakdown envelope ,and was previously unreported. Since the majority of these breakdown forms were not documented in any previous unconfined vortex experiments, these observations thus appear to be the first detailed qualitative information on vortex breakdown in an unconfined flow. Also presented is a breakdown map plotted using parameters related directly to the flow conditions, and independent of the apparatus geometry. In light of the numerous means of vortex generation, such a map would provide a valuable means of comparison for all types of vortical flow INTRODUCTIONOne of the more interesting features related to isolated vortices is the phenomenon termed vortex breakdown. It is characterized by an abrupt enlargement of the vortex core following a sudden deceleration of its axial velocity component. This phenomenon is not only typical of geostrophic vortices, such as tornadoes and waterspouts, but also of many man-made devices. It is known to alter the aerodynamic properties and control of lifting bodies, influence the performance of turbo machines and propellor blades and affect the efficiency of swirl combustors etc. These widespread occurrences and effects thus resulted in a great interest on the phenomenon, beginning in the late 1950s (Peckham and Atkinson, 1957) up to the present. However, to this date; its structure and the mechanism of its formation has yet to be fully understood. One reason for this, is the difficulty in studying the phenomenon in its natural condition (especially in cases like tornadoes and vortices shed from wing tips) resulting in the dependency on models to simulate the flow.

AB  - Abstract Accurate torque and drag (T&D) analysis is a fundamental well planning tool essential for predicting and preventing drilling and completion problems. To guarantee an efficient and safe operation, tension/compression and torque on the bottom hole assembly needs to be controlled within acceptable limits. Practically all available torque and drag software can calculate the following general operation modes: rotating off-bottom, pick-up, slack-off, rotary drilling and oriented drilling modes. However in the well construction process, there are many other complex operational modes that are largely absent from available software systems, as discussed in the literature. The industry requires modeling methodology to analyze complex well operations including: setting and un-setting packers, anchoring liner hangers, shearing pins in wellbore departure operations, loading and operating drilling/fishing jars in both overpull and compression. The authors will discuss new modeling software capable of analyzing complex well operations including liner hanger and jarring operations in detail. Further discourse about how modeling these special operations were combined with field experience and confirmed the accuracy of the new module with regards to both special operations and conventional T&D capabilities. The simulation/analysis recommendations were successfully executed in the field and led to increased operational efficiency and unplanned cost avoidance. Case studies will be presented of successful liner hanger deployment and complex drilling jar simulation. Introduction Torque and drag (T&D) analysis has been a subject of research for several years. The objective is to predict and prevent drilling and completion problems before they occur [1-10]. This type modeling is becoming more critical with the advancement of techniques that include extended reach drilling (ERD), high temperature high pressure (HTHP) applications and complex wellbore geometries. Designing a safe and efficient bottom hole assembly (BHA) and casing/liner plan is important in these operating conditions to deliver operator-driven wellbore/casing requirements and keep project costs within budget (AFE). For example, when the BHA tripped into a highly deviated wellbore some parts of the drillstring are in tension while others are in compression. To ensure an efficient operation, engineers must strike a workable balance between tension in the pipe/connection while holding compression within the string's buckling force limit and minimize torque on the surface drive system. Drag force is attributed to the friction between the drillstring and the borehole wall when moving the BHA through the existing wellbore. In a simple model, drag is the increased/decreased apparent hook-load when tripping plus the observed rotating hook-load at the equivalent depth. The driller's hook-load gauge is the only measure of the combination of these downhole dynamics. Additionally, buoyed drilling fluid weight and BHA contact forces against the hole wall all affect the boundary condition of available weight and/or torque at a particular tool of interest (TOI).

AB  - ABSTRACTAlloy 22 (UNS N06022) and Ti Grade 7 (UNS R52400) have been proposed as the corrosion resistant materials for fabricating the waste package outer barrier and the drip shield, respectively, for the proposed nuclear waste repository at the Yucca Mountain Project. In this work, the general corrosion behavior of welded and annealed Alloy 22 and Ti Grade 7 in BSW-12 environments from 60 ° to 105°C was studied by simple immersion test for four weeks and eight weeks. The corrosion rate for Alloy 22 was found to be 0.003 mpy at 60°C and 0.012 mpy at 105°C (0.075 and 0.30 microns/year) and 0.008 mpy at 60°C to 0.026 mpy at 105°C (0.2 and 0.65 microns/year) for Ti Grade 7. The corrosion of Ti Grade 7 and Alloy 22 is discussed in terms of the corrosion rates as functions of temperature and exposure time and the correlation between the corrosion behavior and surface morphology. For Ti Grade 7, the imperfections (precipitates, inclusions, stringers, pores etc.) inherited from materials processing may serve as the sites of preferential dissolution or "traps" for corrosion products. In case of Alloy 22, the existence of graphite particles (or carbides) did not seem to deteriorate the excellent corrosion resistance of both annealed and welded materials. The apparent activation energies for Ti Grade 7 and Alloy 22 in BSW-12 environment were found to be approximately 22.4 - 23.5 KJmol 1 and 24.9 - 26.8 KJ mo1-1, respectively. There was no obvious difference between the annealed and welded materials. INTRODUCTIONThe current design concept for geological containment of high-level nuclear waste [1, 2] includes a two-layer waste canister structure with the outer layer made of a 20-mm-thick Alloy 22 fit concentrically over a 50-mm-thick inner structural barrier fabricated from 316 NG (nuclear grade) stainless steel. The whole package will be covered by a self-supported 15-mm thick Ti Grade 7 mailbox-shaped drip shield [2]. The current design concept is schematically shown in Figure 1 [3]. Numerous studies have been performed to evaluate the susceptibility to stress corrosion cracking, general, localized, galvanic and microbial corrosion for Alloy 22 [1, 4-10] and Ti Grade 7 [11-13]. The regulatory target minimum lifetime of 10,000 years for HLW containment without exceeding the EPA- specified dose limits at the designated site boundaries results in the need for a highly corrosion resistant waste package outer barrier material such as Alloy 22. McDermott Technology, Inc. (MTI) has been conducting an on-going testing program for DOE Yucca Mountain Project in Las Vegas, Nevada. The program consists of a series of confirmatory tests on general and localized corrosion, stress corrosion cracking and hydrogen embrittlement of Alloy 22, Ti Grade 7 and 316 NG in several modified and highly concentrated simulated J-13 site groundwater environments including simulated concentrated water (SCW), basic saturated water (BSW) and simulated saturated water (SSW) [1 ]. The objectives of this part of the program were to study the general corrosion behavior of annealed and welded Alloy 22 and annealed and welded Ti Grade 7 in one specific highly concentrated (~50,000-fold) basic saturated water (BSW-12) environment over a range of temperature from 60 to 105°C and to relate the corrosion behavior to the surface morphologies and conditions of the materials. The objectives were to be achieved by studying the corrosion rates of the materials as functions of temperature and comparing the corrosion behavior of annealed and welded Alloy 22 and annealed and welded Ti Grade 7. The roles of intrinsic surface imperfections (precipitates, inclusions, stringers, pores etc.) were studied by examination of the surface conditions before

AB  - Abstract The experimental investigation of rockburst is the key step to understand the failure mechanism of an underground rockmass excavation. Thus, a recently developed test facility of strain rockburst combined with acoustic emission (AE) technique was used to study the dynamic failure behaviors of some rock samples of China. Strain rockburst type was classified by the processes of rockburst experiments in laboratory, involving instantaneous rockburst, stage rockburst, and delay rockburst. The suitable study method of every stage of strain rockburst was also discussed. Furthermore, combining the strength criterion of Hoek-Brown with the strength of rock, we could not only simply determine whether the rock sample fails or not, but we could also evaluate the type of rockburst relying upon stress path. Additionally, the sources of driving force of strain rockburst were analyzed, generally including three kinds such as gravity, tectonic, and complicated gravity-tectonics. It was found that the percentage of highfrequency and high-amplitude of the AE signals for both the coal and the marble continuously increases from loading, unloading to rockburst. Finally, fractal geometry was used to describe the rockburst failure characteristics on different regards such as complex patterns of rock fragments, crack forms (intergranular crack and transgranular crack or both of them), fragments tomography distribution and fractal dimension of grain size. All these studies can motivate us to better improve the design of underground. 1. Introduction Rockburst frequently occurs in mining, excavation, and tunneling engineering [1, 2, 3]. Many methods have been used primarily to study the failure mechanism of rockburst in laboratory. The experimental investigations in these areas have been mainly concentrated on several aspects such as uniaxial compressive test, biaxial rockburst, triaxial rockburst test, and dynamicstatic triaxial test [4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24, 25]. Classification, evolution process, and mechanism upon rockburst have been developed to make it possible for improving the design of underground rock engineering. For example, the rockbursts at Qinling Tunnel of China were classified into as spalling, fragment ejecting, and violent ejecting, by Gu et al [26]. Furthermore, the fractal and fracture topography analyses upon in-situ rockburst fragments were performed by SEM image method [27]. We have developed a new experimental system [33], which we call the true triaxial experimental system of strain rockburst, of treating rockmass violent failure which can be triggered by excavation, mining, and tunneling. The advantage of this special testing facility is that loading path and stress condition can be considered in rockburst test to sufficiently simulate both multiaxial stress states and opening boundaries due to underground excavation. With this test facility, abrupt unloading of the minimum principal stress in one loading face can be realized, creating stress state and boundary condition in rock sample similar to the one that exists on tunnel boundary. Furthermore, rockburst monitoring accompanied acoustic emission (AE) technique together with this system can be also used to describe timefrequency characters, occurrence mechanism, and stress path upon rockmass dynamic failure.

AB  - Abstract Empirical equations for surface tension of propane and normal butane as functions of reduced temperature are obtained from experimental data. Another correlation relating surface tension to enthalpy of vaporization is given for these two compounds. In addition, new parachor numbers are calculated for the normal paraffin hydrocarbons. These numbers are utilized for the calculation of interfacial tension of two-component systems as functions of pressure and temperature, using a modified form of Weinaug-Katz equation. The experimental data for two binary systems are approximated by the correlation. From these results it is found that the inter facial tension in the high-pressure region remains extremely low at large pressure decrements below the critical pressure. Thus, it appears that condensate systems may have flow characteristics almost like single-phase conditions even though the pressure is within the two-phase region. Experimental data have shown that interfacial tension divided by density difference approaches zero as the critical pressure is approached. A calculation of wetting-phase saturations indicates that the saturation gradient at the two-phase contact becomes increasingly abrupt as the critical pressure is approached. Discussion Prediction of the surface and interfacial tension of the light hydrocarbons and of two-component hydrocarbon mixtures at various temperatures and pressures may be made if other physical properties are known. Extensive experimental work on single-component and binary systems is the basis for the correlations outlined in this paper. Interfacial tension is defined as the specific surface-free energy between two phases of unlike fractional composition, while surface tension is defined as the specific surface-free energy between two phases of the same fractional composition. The usual definitions relating interfacial tension to a liquid-liquid interface and surface tension to a gas-liquid interface are not clearly defined when the critical region is included, and there is no sharp distinction between a gas and a liquid phase. Interfacial tension is probably the most important single force that makes one-half to one-third of the total oil actually in place in a reservoir rock unrecoverable by conventional gas-drive or waterflood methods. A rough estimate of this figure for the United States is 100 billion bbl. Interfacial tension presently is used by petroleum engineers in the estimation of saturation gradients at the gas-oil contact and at the oil-water contact. The data in this paper should prove useful for estimates of reserves involving gas-oil contacts. Relative permeability undoubtedly is influenced by interfacial tension, for sufficiently small values. These data should be useful in determining how small the values are. In addition, these data should eventually add to our fundamental knowledge of surfaces. At the critical point, all surface excesses approach zero and the thickness becomes very large. SINGLE-COMPONENT SYSTEMS It has been observed that the following relationships are good approximations to the physical properties of propane and n-butane. For propane, For n-butane, Guggenheim's values for these constants, not specifically for hydrocarbons, are SPEJ P. 259^

AB  - INTRODUCTION:Following the stress measurement carried out as part of the Rangely earthquake control experiment (Raleigh et al, 1972; and Haimson, 1973), numerous investigators began making in-situ stress measurements using the hydraulic fracturing technique. Haimson (1977) and McGarr and Gay (1977) review much of this work. Because the reliability of these measurements depends upon understanding the fracture initiation and extension process, we consider several aspects of hydraulic fracture propagation relevant to use of the technique for the determination of in-situ stress. Hubbert and Willis (1957) showed that the pressure to hydraulically fracture a wellbore depends on the tensile strength of the rock and tectonic stresses. A number of authors (Scheidegger, 1962; Kehle, 1964; and Haimson and Fairhurst, 1971) subsequently pointed out that the pressure-time records of a hydraulic fracturing operation could be used to compute the tectonic stresses if the tensile strength of the rock were known. Hubbert and Willis showed that a vertical fracture should form in a vertical wellbore at the azimuth of the maximum compressive horizontal principal stress, SHmax(it was presumed that one principal stress, Sv, is due only to the weight of the overburden and is vertical). Pb is presumably indicated by an abrupt drop in borehole pressure and is thus termed the breakdown pressure (see Figure 1). Because the fracture should propagate perpendicular to the direction of least compression when SHmin Sv, SHmin is presumed to be equal to the instantaneous shut-in pressure (ISIP, see Figure 1). Interpretation of shut-in pressures in cases when SHmin Sv is discussed at length below. When pre-existing fractures are present Abou-Sayed et al (1977) suggest that it is possible to estimate SHmax when the length of such fractures are known. Rather than use pre-existing fractures, it has been shown that appropriate steps may be taken to overcome their presence.

AB  - ABSTRACTAir lubrication is a promising idea to reduce hull drag and increase hull speed. Although some applications of this concept has been carried out in several countries, there are still few theoretic studies and numerical simulations concerning to its application on high speed planing crafts, and even fewer systematic investigations to examine the influencing factors when it applied on stepped planing crafts. To elaborate these, a numerical study on drag reduction by air layer at a flat plate with bottom step is then carried out, by using 2D viscid numerical model and Air-Liquid Mixture phase model via Fluent code. Some factors, such as fluid velocity, air injection velocity, step height, stern ramp and air injection location on drag reduction rate and air cavity shape are discussed. It is found that the key factors impacting drag reduction rate are not the air injection velocity but the air flow rate, bottom step height and air inlet location. Fluid velocity has little effect on the non-dimension saturation air flow rate. A long and stable air cavity can be obtained by setting an abrupt step on the lower surface of plate, but the saturation air flow rate is increased as the step height increase up. A stern ramp toward the step rear is beneficial to increase the length and thickness of air cavity. The air cavity is kept to be stable when air inlet location is set in the fluid stagnant area, but it may change to bubble layer while the injection location out of the range. INTRODUCTIONAir lubrication is a promising method to reduce hull drag. At present, this conception can be implemented as two approaches. The first one is named Air Bubble Drag Reduction by injecting air bubble into the nearwall region of hull, using the bubble to change the density, viscosity and turbulence model of water, and finally reduce skin-friction (Madavan, 1985; Dong et al., 2002).

AB  - ABSTRACT: Numerical simulations of hydraulic fracture (HF) propagation through layered rocks show the effects of rock layering and interfaces on fracture height growth. When the contrast in properties between adjacent rock layers is high and abrupt, the resulting interface between these layers is often weak, exhibiting low tensile strength, low friction coefficient, and high hydraulic conductivity. Thus, they easily detach (in tension) and slip (in shear), as the hydraulic fracture crosses them, creating localized obstacles for fracture propagation as well as localized zones of fluid loss. Numerical simulations were conducted using the newly-implemented pore pressure cohesive elements as certain predefined hydraulic fracture and interface opening paths in ABAQUS 2016. To validate the model and for comparison we conducted simulations on elastically-homogeneous and elastically-layered rocks and, for the latter, we used a range of tensile strength and fluid flow properties at the interfaces between layers, to understand their impact on vertical hydraulic fracture (height) growth. Our results show a systematic decrease in fracture height and fracturing fluid efficiency with increasing interface hydraulic conductivity. This relationship is important because of its potential impact on improving fracture diagnostics in the field. We also observe that the interface strength directly affects fracture height growth as well as fluid efficiency. These findings are important for a proper assessment of fracture height growth, a better assessment of the created fracture surface area, and better predictions of well production.1. INTRODUCTIONHydraulic fracturing (HF) treatments have been widely used to enhance oil and gas production (Economides and Nolte, 2000; Holditch, 2006). Improving the representation of these treatments with more adequate numerical modeling is important because it helps to increase the created fracture surface area, to reduce completion costs, and to improve well production. When considering more complex reservoirs, such as shale and mudstone, numerical simulation of the hydraulic fracture treatments is considerably more challenging because of the layered nature of the rock and the impact of the associated interfaces of contact between layers, inhomogeneity, and pre-existing natural fractures on hydraulic fracture growth.

AB  - ABSTRACT: In order to economically produce unconventional reservoirs, it is necessary to fracture hydraulically to increase the exposed surface of the formation and generate channels of high conductivity. The non-degradation of conductivity during the productive life of the well is crucial for a good production performance. During the well production, the bottom hole flowing pressure reduces for a fixed choke diameter. Additionally, at each choke change, there is an increase in the rate of pressure falling. During the linear flow, the degree of fracture degradation can be analyzed using a plot of the inverse of productivity index against the square root of time. The slope is related to the exposed surface of the hydraulic fracture and its permeability. The higher the slope, the smaller the area and / or the permeability. Based on that it is concluded that the hydraulic fracture has been damaged or disconnected at each choke change. In addition, such loss would appear to be abrupt and not gradual and occurs at different absolute values of bottom hole flowing pressure.There are different mechanisms of fracture conductivity degradation among which we can name embedment, crushing and spalling. In the present work the effect of the different variables that governs these phenomena are studied by numerical geomechanical simulation. In particular, proppant-formation contact and the exposed face of the fracture during production are simulated in detail analyzing the spalling phenomena. Based on these studies, first, the phenomena present in the fracture conductivity tests are compared to those that occur in hydraulic fractures during the well productivity. Secondly, a computational tool is developed to follow the well productivity life and determine the best moment to choke diameter change. Finally, recommendations for drawdown management are generated aimed to preserve the health of hydraulic fractures in order to maximize production performance and well economy.

AB  - SummaryAn experimental and theoretical study was conducted to resolve discrepancies between observed and calculated pressure losses for fluids flowing through the nozzles of jet bits. The use of a nozzle discharge coefficient of 0.95, which is commonly used for roller-cone bits, results in the calculated pressure drop being up to 30% more than actually occurs, with the average error being 14.7% for 770 data points measured with nine different fluids. A relationship is presented to calculate the discharge coefficient as a function of borehole pressure, nozzle size, and mud density, which reduces the mean absolute error to 3 % for these data points. Simply increasing the discharge coefficient to a constant value of 1.02 results in reducing the error to 4.1 % without using the more complicated relationship.IntroductionThe pressure loss through the nozzles of a jet bit is a very significant part of the total circulating pressure on a rig. Kendall and Goins1 indicated that a bit pressure drop of 59 to 66 % of the total pump pressure is needed for the most effective use of the pump horsepower for cleaning the bit (assuming that this pressure drop results in a flow rate sufficient to exceed the minimum annular velocity). These percentages are based on maximizing the impact force and the bit hydraulic horsepower. It is not unusual for the bit pressure loss to be greater than 60% of the total pump pressure at shallow depths, but the percentage typically decreases as well depth increases.Bit pressure losses are usually calculated with Eq. 1:Equation 1The nozzle discharge coefficient, Kd, in this equation is normally assumed to be 0.95, and thus the pressure loss is simply a function of mud density, ?, flow rate, q, and nozzle diameter, dn. Refs. 2 through 6 indicated that the discharge coefficient may be dependent upon the nozzle geometry, fluid density, jet velocity, cavitation number, and fluid composition.Roller-cone bit pressures were observed to be lower than those calculated with Eq. 1 for drilling tests conducted at Amoco over several years. In 1983, Ramsey et al.2,7 presented the results of a similar observation that indicated that the bit pressure losses were 10 to 25 % lower than expected. They concluded that the smaller total bit pressure loss was caused by "pressure recovery" and that the pressure-recovery phenomenon could affect the calculation of the equivalent circulating density (ECD). Cook et al.8 reported field measurements of the bit pressure drop that were lower than those calculated and suggested that the inaccuracy could be caused by a lower-than-expected pump efficiency. Because of the abundant evidence that the conventional method for calculating bit pressure losses is inaccurate, a study was conducted to provide a more accurate method of calculating them.Background of Bit Pressure-Loss EquationEq. 1 is derived by applying Bernoulli's equation between a point upstream of a nozzle and a point at the nozzle throat. A discharge coefficient, typically 0.95, is added to the equation primarily to account for the nonideal behavior of the fluid.Most literature that includes a reference to the discharge coefficient for bits refers to Eckel and Bielstein3,4 and implies that they recommend the use of a value of 0.95. Eckel and Bielstein present the results of an experimental study aimed at designing a more efficient nozzle for rock bits at a time (1953) when "jets" were first being used to replace open-flow ports. They tested a variety of nozzle entrance and exit geometries and identified a particular entrance geometry that consistently gave discharge coefficients greater than 0.98. In some cases the discharge coefficient was greater than 1.0. Their work made a significant contribution to the advancement of bit hydraulic designs, but is of little help in determining the best value to use for the discharge coefficient with today's nozzle designs. In fact, the recommendation to use a discharge coefficient of 0.95 is not found in Ref. 3 or 4.Bit Pressure RecoveryFig. 1 is a schematic of the flow through and around a bit. The bit pressure drop is defined as the pressure in the bore at the top of the bit, pb, minus the pressure in the annulus at the top of the bit, pa. It is not apparent from an examination of Fig. 1 that the pressure loss can be represented totally by the change in pressure from the bit bore to the nozzle throat, as assumed in the previous discussion of the pressure-loss equation. There may be additional pressure changes associated with viscous frictional losses around the bit, losses associated with the 180° change in flow direction under the bit, and pressure increases caused by fluid velocity decreases downstream of the nozzle.The pressure loss around the bit can be determined only by experimental measurement because no reliable analytical methods are available to calculate the pressure drop from pa to pb. Eq. 1 predicts only the pressure drop that results from accelerating the fluid through the nozzle throat. This prediction can be improved somewhat by including an abrupt expansion downstream of the nozzle. This method is only slightly better than the previous method, but it provides for an estimate of the maximum possible value of "pressure recovery."Bernoulli's equation can be applied from Point 1 to Point 2 in Fig. 1.

AB  - Abstract East Siberia is a new and promising centre of oil and gas industry in Russia. Reserves explored in the region amount to ~11 percent of oil, ~14 percent of natural gas, and ~16 percent of gas condensate reserves of Russia. However, East Siberia is currently producing no more than 0.3 percent of Russian oil and about 1 percent of gas [1]. Major causes of such a low production level include remoteness of the region, poorly developed infrastructure, complicated geology, numerous faults, high mineralization of formation water in pay zones, etc. The largest oil- and gas-bearing object of East Siberia is the Vendian terrigenous complex, which transgressively and discordantly overlies the eroded surface of Riphean rock. The complex is represented by the Parfenovskiy Horizon (the Kovykta Field), the Vanavarskaya Suite (the Sobinskoye Field), the Verhnechonskiy Horizon (the Verhnechonskoye Field), the Botuobinskiy Horizon (Srednebotuobinskoye and Chayandinskoye fields), etc. The present publication focuses on our experiences of applying geosteering to drilling in the Verkhnechonskiy Horizon interval of the Verkhnechonskoye oil and gas condensate field. The key specific feature of the Verkhnechonskiy Horizon reservoir is its almost all-round yet very uneven Salinization [2]. Moreover, some of the rock series contain significant volumes of accessory minerals of anomalous physical properties [3]. Risks of drilling horizontal wells in poorly productive intervals are significant due to highly abrupt variability of reservoir rocks of the terrigenous complex in interwell space. With application of LWD, it is possible to drill horizontal sections of wells through the most favourable subsurface zones and to obtain reliable determinations of resistance-contrasting boundaries of formations along the entire wellbore [4]. It is generally an adeqaute condition for timely adjustment of well trajectories and for keeping wellbores within target interval boundaries. Geosteering makes it possible to achieve a 10 percent increase in penetrating the best reservoir by horizontal wellbores in comparison with the originally designed wellbores. The average total effect of geosteering in more than 20 wells came to 67 tpd per well. Subject of the Study The Verkhnechonskoye Field is located in East Siberia within the Mid-Siberian high plateau boundaries (Figure A-1). As bulk of the oil reserves is associated with Vc1 and Vc2 formations, determination of reservoirs, evaluation of reservoir saturation and quantitative assessment of rock porosity and permeability properties are especially challenging in studies of the Verkhnechonskiy sediments. Therefore, development of new methodological approaches to enhance geological efficiency of various methods applied to studying the profiles of the Verkhnechonskiy sediments should be a priority. In the Verkhnechonskiy Horizon, deposits were formed and sediments were accumuled in submontane and possibly coastdeltoid environment. Diagenetic and catagenetic transformations and metasomatism processes led to high heterogeneity of both mineral composition of the rocks and the complex structure of the rocks' pore space. In view of the above factors, petrophysical modelling of rocks and reservoirs of the Verkhnechonskiy Horizon is significantly complicated, while ‘conventional' approaches based on logging demonstrate lower effectiveness when applied to quantitative assessment of rock porosity and permeability properties, and uncertainties are abundant in geological modelling.

AB  - ABSTRACT:Computational modeling aspects of weak plunging wave breaking, over a relatively mild sloping laboratory beach, were investigated in the present paper. Comparisons against latest elaborate experimental data were used to support the discussion. Smoothed Particle Hydrodynamics method was implemented as a numerical tool and the recently enhanced version of the academic ‘open source’ code SPHysics v.2 was ratified. Fine spatial resolution calibration was undertaken in an attempt to render effective a Sub-Particle Scale Smagorinsky-type turbulence closure that treats energy dissipation of eddy formations for the unresolved flow scales. Fine visual reproduction of the ragged freesurface flow deformation was supplemented with plausible results concerning classic wave dynamics characteristics, sophisticated turbulent surf-zone features and wave-induced currents. INTRODUCTIONNear-shore wave breaking, consequent turbulence transport and the resulting mean flows in the surf zone have always been and still remain major issues for engineers and scientists in their quest to comprehend, fully describe and predict the evolution of coastal processes. Particularly in the surf zone, the wave pattern goes through extremely abrupt changes and the emerging flow field becomes highly unstable and violent, especially during plunging-type wave breaking. Physical modeling of the latter over even, mild sloping, laboratory beach-type formations (e.g. Ting & Kirby, 1994) has set the grounds of profound insight on the matter, yet experimental efforts relate always to specific hydraulic and geometric laboratory conditions. Nowadays the use of conditionally flexible enhanced computational approaches is imperatively necessary. Thus rigorous validation of them discerns among modern coastal hydrodynamics research endeavours. In this framework, Grilli et al. (2001) used a higher-order Boundary Element Method (BEM) to simulate a 3D overturning solitary wave, yet only in terms of free surface elevation. The respective velocity field was reproduced in Guyenne and Grilli (2003), though not including any vortical pattern representation.

AB  - ABSTRACTThe elastic modulus is perhaps the single most convenient parameter for characterizing the deformability of a rock mass. This paper presents a case study of a site where the elastic modulus of the bedrock had been measured through numerous laboratory and in-situ techniques. The wealth of information acquired at the site provides an opportunity to compare the results of different test procedures and to assess some of the factors that contribute to variations in the measurements. 1 INTRODUCTIONA major industrial development in western New York State is nearing completion. The nature and engineering characteristics of the rock formations that underlie the site have been intensively studied to a depth of almost 350 ft (107 m). The testing programs included a wide variety of both laboratory and in-situ techniques. The testing programs evolved over a period of almost 15 years as the need for new or additional data on rock mass properties became apparent and as testing procedures were refined. Although the data base was not assembled with the rigor of a research project it is reasonably comprehensive. The testing programs provided a wealth of information on the deformability of the rock mass. This paper will focus on a single parameter, the elastic (or Young's) modulus. 2 SITE DESCRIPTIONThe site is located on the southern shore of Lake Ontario. It lies within the Erie-Ontario Lowlands of the Central Lowlands Physiographic Province. The soil cover consists of a relatively thin veneer of glacial tills and recent fills which have a combined thickness that seldom exceeds 12 ft (3.7 m). The bedrock surface is clean and unweathered. 2.1 Stratigraphy The bedrock studied at the site belongs to the Oswego Sandstone and the Upper Lorraine Group, two major stratigraphic divisions of a Late Ordovician deltaic complex.Oswego Sandstone The Oswego Sandstone is a siliceous, medium-to fine-grained, massive sandstone with minor shale and siltstone beds. The thickness of the formation increases from 35 ft (11 m) to 120 ft (37 m) across the site, a north to south distance of approximately 3000 ft (914 m). The increase occurs because of the combined effects of topographic relief and a regional dip in the bedding of approximately 0.5 degrees to the south. Upper Lorraine Group The Upper Lorraine Group is composed of two intergrading lithologic units, the Pulaski Formation and the Whetstone Gulf Formation. The Pulaski Formation has a relatively uniform thickness of approximately 100 ft (31 m). The Whetstone Gulf Formation has a thickness of at least 230 ft (70m). Both formations consist of an alternating sequence of siltstone, shale, sandstone and greywacke. The overall sequence is characterized by abrupt lithologic variations and slight gradation of one rock type into another. The bedding thickness reaches a maximum of almost 5 ft (1.5 m) near the middle of the Pulaski Formation; however, it is typically less than 1.5 ft (0.5m) and tends to decrease with depth. The distinctions between the divisions (and subdivisions) of the Upper Lorraine Group at the site are based primarily on lithologic compositions and bedding thicknesses.

AB  - ABSTRACT Parametric roll resonance of modern containerships was predicted at initial design phase using numerical simulations and model scale experiments in a deep towing tank. Dynamic instabilities of modern containerships vulnerable to large but bounded roll motions when either floating or advancing in certain frequencies of wave encounter were successfully simulated using three-dimensional time-domain seakeeping computations based on Rankine source panel method. In the hydrodynamic computations geometric nonlinearity was accounted for in Froude-Krylov and restoring forces using simple wave corrections over exact wet hull surface of the containerships. The numerical simulations in the present work were compared with the calculations based on a classification society in-house code specially designed to assess parametric roll motions of commercial vessels. The computations for a mid-size and an ultra-large size containerships were validated through four degree-of-freedom model scale seakeeping experiments in regular head waves at the deep towing tank of Hyundai Heavy Industries. INTRODUCTION In general, the roll response is a matter of no great importance for the ship in head seas. However many shipping agents have reported excessive roll motions when containerships, whose ship shape and size are modern and large, were operating in head seas of the harsh ocean environments. The abrupt accident of the large containership as well as Panamax or post-Panamax class is well known (William et al., 2003; Riberiro e Silva et al., 2004). Recently, the concern for the roll resonance due to the parametric excitation in the head sea and following seas tends to increase with the size of the containership, which is now exceeding 10,000 TEU class. The parametric resonance of the roll motion occurs suddenly in head seas or following seas and causes the roll motions to grow rapidly to an excessive roll angle of 40 degrees.

AB  - Abstract A search was made of the literature to determine the erect of the ion content of cement filtrates on shale and clay mineral formations. The influence of the ions on solubility by the addition of salt is shown. Using formation samples, and applying a variety of brines and cement filtrates, flow rates and permeabilities are compared. Discussed are factors that limit the penetration of formations by cement filtrate. Introduction Salt has many unique properties for use in oilwell cementing. Ludwig described the general effects of salt on cement and the basic chemistry involved when cement reacts with sodium chloride in concentrations ranging up to saturation of the mixing water. Some qualities characteristic of salt, used in unspecified quantities for oilwell cementing, are that it (1) improves flow properties, (2) is a good dispersing agent, (3) is compatible with most other additives, (4) acts as an accelerator in low concentrations and as a retarder in high concentrations, (5) aids in expansion of set cements, and (6) increases slurry weight. Slagle and Smith reported, "the principal benefit of salt evolves not from its accelerating, dispersing or retarding properties but, rather, because of its influence on clay minerals, which represent a predominant portion of shales and exist in various quantities in sands and other producing formations". More recently a question was raised as to formation permeability damage by leak-off of salt cement filtrate. A search for answers to this question took the form of a survey of available literature and laboratory studies. The literature survey shows the effects on shale and other clay mineral-bearing formations of ions normally found in cement slurry filtrate. Several filtrates were used to determine the relative effect cement filtrate invasion can have on formation permeability, and whether or not deleterious reactions exist between formation constitutents and the ionic components of a filtrate. Effect of Ionic Environment On Bentonitic Formations Most researchers agree that permeability reduction in bentonitic sandstone occurs from two sources: swelling of clay minerals, and migration of dislodged particles to a constriction in the pore system. In his work with permeability of sandstone cores, Mungan concluded that the primary cause of permeability reduction is blocking of the pore by dispersed particles, and that permeability reduction due to salinity changes occurs regardless of the type of clay. The changes referred to here are changes in solutions containing no divalent cations such as calcium, and abrupt changes in concentration. Jones stated that an increase of salt concentrations in water tends to prevent clay blocking. He pointed out that clays in the calcium form do not disperse so easily in fresh water as do those in the sodium form. Jones concluded that cores capable of even severe clay blocking generally can conduct water as fresh as drinking water without significant change in permeability if at least one-tenth of the salts dissolved are calcium or magnesium salts, and if the salinity is decreased very gradually rather than abruptly. Hewitt concluded that a reduction in cation concentration by dilution promotes dispersion, and that the amount of swelling of each clay generally increases with a decrease in salinity of the surrounding fluid. He stated, "Therefore, a concentrated brine would cause the least damage; fresh water would cause the most." Van Olphen showed how Van der Waals attractive force is sufficient to overcome the repulsive forces of the electric double layer in bentonitic sols at high electrolyte concentrations, and thereby collapse the expanded clay particles. Foster, Savins and Waite showed this particle collapse by means of X-ray measurements of the distance between platelets, made at increasing salinities of solution (Fig. 1). JPT P. 259^

AB  - ABSTRACTThis paper reports the application of a new tool, designed in accordance with \"packed-hole\" principles, to practically and economically eliminate doglegs and effectively minimize the rate of change in hole deviation. Additional functions such as the elimination of under sized spiral holes and ledges are discussed. The beneficial effect on rock-bit life is noted.The possibility that this assembly creates a \"self-compensating\" effect actually tending toward straightening hole, while simultaneously performing the other beneficial functions, is considered. Advantages and disadvantages of the near-bit stabilizer-sub assembly are pointed out and examined, Actual field performance in server areas is presented and the economic advantages of the assembly are illustrated.INTRODUCTIONIt has not yet become possible to drill a vertical hole as rapidly as one somewhat less vertical. This being the case, recent studies have been toward limiting the rate of change of angle, rather than the angle itself. It is now an accepted fact that the slant of a hole is not necessarily bad for either drilling or producing operations. Limited-angle drilling contracts in no way assure the operator of a hole that is free of the other hazard attributed to deviated holes. Problems of under-sized holes, abrupt dog-legs, ledges, and spiraled holes are not solved by rigid deviation control. This concept has led to a relaxation of overall deviation limitations on the part of many operators. Along with this liberalization of maximum allowable hole angle has come an increased emphasis on eliminating the other hazards. Various types of bottom-hole assemblies have been developed and utilized to this end Invariable these assemblies are based on the \"packed-hole\" concept of limiting the rate of changes of hole angle. The packed-hole technique not only performs this function, but also minimizes or eliminates the other hazards. Thus, the use of a proper bottom-hole assembly adds much to the feasibility of more relaxed deviation restrictions. Methods of packing the hole have varied from the use of large-diameter round drill collars, through various reamer-stabilizer hookups and ribbed drill collars, to the use of square drill collar with corners rounded off to a dimension 3/16 in under hole size. The equipment discussed in this paper performs all the functions required of any packed-hole assembly and, at the same, offers several additional advantages. MULTIPLE-STABILIZER PACKED-HOLE ASSEMBLIESThe principle behind a packed-hole assembly is, of course, to resist changes in hole angle by restricting lateral bit movement. The effectiveness of a packed-hole assembly is determined by: 1, diametrical difference; 2, length or stabilizer placement; 3, stiffness; 4, effectiveness of wall support. With zero diametrical difference, sufficient length, a very stiff assembly, and absolute wall support, it would be impossible for the hole to deviate from that plane in which it was originally started. This set of conditions, however, will never exist in reality. Diametrical DifferenceIt is impossible to maintain zero diametrical difference. Bits tend to drill slightly over-gage hole. The API tolerance on nominal bit size is to the plus side. The walls of the hole tend to wash and erode.

AB  - Summary Bottomhole treating pressure (BHTP) behavior during the fracture treatmentof western U.S. coalbeds is unique and often unpredictable because of thedistinctive material properties of coal. This paper assigns the most-probablecauses to specific BHTP behavior and shows ways to adapt to the downholeproblems associated with these BHTP anomalies. Introduction Large coal deposits exist in several western U.S. sedimentary basins.Motivated by a nonconventional fuel tax credit, many operators have completedwells in western U.S. coalbeds to evaluate the viability of methaneproduction. Fracture treatments are used routinely to complete western U.S. coalbedmethane wells. During these treatments, BHTP often acts anomalously, affectingthe treatment performance in various ways. 2 The objectives of this paper areto describe the BHTP behavior that is unique to coals, to assign amost-probable cause to specific BHTP behavior, and to recommend ways to adaptto the downhole problems associated with BHTP anomalies. To achieve theseobjectives, the characteristics of coalbed methane reservoirs and the factorsaffecting fracture treatments in coals are discussed. Coalbed treatments in theGreen River southwestern Wyoming) and San Juan southwestern Colorado andnorthwestern New Mexico) basins are used as examples of anomalous BHTP behaviorand to describe innovations in coalbed treatments. Rock and Reservoir Properties. The physical properties of coal aredistinctive. Coal has a spongelike pore network. Coal gas is adsorbed on thesurfaces of micropores <20A [<2 nm] in diameter. Cross-settingshrinkage fractures, called cleats, are the large pore channels through whichfluid flows in the reservoir; these pore channels through which fluid flows inthe reservoir; these fractures formed when volatile materials (e.g., water,methane, and CO2) were expelled from the coal. Also, fractures caused bytectonic or differential-compaction stresses can exist in a mature coal.Natural fractures affect the fracturing-fluid leakoff rate and can serve asinitiation sites for multiple hydraulic fractures during stimulationtreatments. Most coal reservoirs must be dewatered to reduce the reservoir porepressure, so that gas can desorb and then diffuse into the natural fracturesystem. Coals have a high irreducible water saturation; consequently, theirrelative permeability to gas is low (i.e., 10% of absolute permeability). Thisinherent permeability restriction impairs gas flow to the wellbore.permeability restriction impairs gas flow to the wellbore. The compressivestrength of coal is low; near-wellbore coal degradation and coalfines movementduring drilling, completion, and production operations are common problems.Coal is a soft rock production operations are common problems. Coal is a softrock with a low elasticity modulus. This property facilitates the creation ofrelatively wide hydraulic fractures and the containment of fractures in thecoal interval when the interfacial shell strength across the coal/bounding-rockinterface is low. The softness of coal also facilitates proppant embedment.Other mechanical features of coal, such as high fracture toughness andporoelasticity in highly fractured, water-saturated coals, may poroelasticityin highly fractured, water-saturated coals, may elevate BHTP to a very highlevel during fracture treatment. Why Are Fracture Treatments Needed? Jeu et al. noted four main reasons whyfracture treatments are needed in cased-hole coalbed-methane completions. 1. They bypass wellbore damage. Natural fractures can be invaded and pluggedby drilling solids and cement. Fracture plugging was observed in mine-throughoperations in a coal seam in the Black Warrior basin; cement was found incleats more than 100 ft [30 m] from the entry source, a vertical wellbore. 2.They accelerate dewatering and pressure drawdown. Pressure drawdown must extenddeep into the seam to accelerate gas release from the micropores. Proppedfractures increase the effective wellbore radius when the fracture conductivitycontrast is high. 3. They distribute the pressure drawdown to reduce finesproduction. This can be accomplished by reducing the pressure drop in thenear-wellbore area, where the coal is often degraded. 4. They connect thewellbore to the entire reservoir effectively. Abrupt vertical discontinuitiesoften are present in coalbeds; perforations may not connect with all thefracture networks.

AB  - Abstract Injectivity decline with further stabilisation was widely observed and reported in the literature. It can be explained by different physical mechanisms. The correct diagnosis of formation damage mechanism allows choosing the right damage removal technology during seawater injection and Produced Water Re-Injection (PWRI). Reliable prediction of injectivity decline is essential for planning of well stimulation, fracturing, etc. Usually the stabilisation of well injectivity index after decline is explained by erosion of external filter cake, or by warm holes or even by fracture opening. Nevertheless, the stabilisation is observed in corefloods too, which evidences internal erosion. So, particle deposit erosion must be considered to interpret the injectivity stabilisation. In the current paper, the particle erosion was described by introduction of a new particle storage capacity function which equals to maximum retained concentration versus dimensionless flow velocity. After the maximum is reached by the retained concentration, particle capture does not happen any more. The particle storage capacity function is a reological characteristic that closes system of governing equations. The coreflood by suspension with permeability stabilisation was performed with a constant injection rate. The pressure drop on the core and the rate have been measured during the flooding. The analytical model developed allows to perfectly match the experimental impedance curve and calculate from it three injectivity damage parameters - filtration and formation damage coefficients, and also the maximum retention concentration. The obtained values of filtration and formation damage coefficients are in the usual variation range for these coefficients. Introduction of just one new parameter - maximum retained concentration - into a classical suspension filtration model allows for significant enrichment of the physics schema for suspension transport and retention. An analytical model of suspension coreflood with piecewise constant rate shows that after changing the flow velocity from some value and coming back to the same value, the impedance returns to the initial constant velocity curve. It takes some time after an abrupt flux decrease to stabilise the resistance growth rate, while the resistance growth rate stabilises immediately after abrupt flux increase. If flow regime changes from low velocity to high velocity, there appears a short particle pulse at the outlet; it does not happen when velocity changes from high value to low value. Introduction During seawater flooding, producer water re-injection and, generally speaking, during injection of any poor quality water, occurs injectivity decline. It was widely reported in the literature1-5. The phenomenon is attributed to capture of solid and liquid particles by rock from the injected water causing the permeability and, consequently, the injectivity decline6,7. After some partial filling of the porous space by particles near to the reservoir inlet cross-section (in the near-wellbore vicinity), the formation of external filter cake on the wellbore wall starts8-12. The cake build-up causes further injectivity decline. This decline takes place for sometime, and stabilises afterwards1,13. Injectivity stabilisation was explained by several different physics mechanisms. Particle dislodging is one of them. F. Civan14 and M. Sharma15,16 model the equilibrium of a "last?? deposited particle on the cake surface via force balance or force moment (torque) balance. The larger is the cake, the lower is the filtrate velocity, and the lower is the viscous force sticking the particle to the cake surface. At some critical cake thickness, the drag force (the drag force moment) exceeds the friction force caused by the permeate force (the permeate force moment) and no particles deposit on the cake surface any more. Similar approach was developed for particle dislodging and cake erosion on membranes17-24.

AB  - This article, written by Senior Technology Editor Dennis Denney, contains highlights of paper IPTC 13363, "Planning, Acquisition, and Processing of the First Industrial 3D Circular-Shooting Seismic Survey," by M. Buia, E. Tozzi, and L. Mapelli, Eni E&P, prepared for the 2009 International Petroleum Technology Conference, Doha, Qatar, 7-9 December. Conventional offshore 3D acquisition is performed mainly with narrow-azimuth-streamer configurations, even in structurally complex areas. A full 3D circular-shooting seismic survey (coil) over the Tulip discovery in Indonesia during August and September 2008 acquired a full-azimuth data set with a single-vessel towed-streamer operation by sailing in circles. The circular geometry introduced several differences and a number of new challenges in the modeling, acquisition, and processing workflow.   Introduction Tulip is a complex structure in the Bukat Block offshore Kalimantan, Indonesia. The water depth ranges from 350 to 1800 m. Several unfavorable geological conditions cause a very poor seismic response in the area. Methane hydrates represent the main problem. The hydrates layer in this area generates a very reflective sea bottom that causes up to seven multiple bounces. The presence of shallow free gas is suggested by an abrupt frequency-amplitude dimming below this bottom-simulating reflector. The well drilled on the structure indicates a seismic-quality factor of less than 70. Moreover, the rough geomorphology of the water bottom, characterized by canyons and irregularities, causes a nonhomogeneous behavior of the illumination in the subsurface and a complex 3D ray path for surface and internal multiples. Complex deep geology (steeply dipping thrust with two culminations) represents a third critical factor, posing severe structural-illumination doubts. Also, the low reflectivity of the target sequence often falls below the noise level. Therefore, vintage seismic in the area is of very poor quality. Circular shooting is an acquisition technique in which the vessel follows a circular preplot line. Circles are repeated in the x- and y-directions to increase fold, offset, and azimuth distribution. This method allows for full-azimuth acquisition by use of a single vessel shooting on a continuous turn. Line changes are short, on the order of minutes, resulting in high acquisition uptime and efficiency. The offset and azimuth distribution of circular shooting is excellent, as good as and sometimes better than the wide multiazimuth techniques.

AB  - AbstractWe have studied the electrical transport properties of porous media and the physical meaning of Archie's parameters with 2D Lattice Gas Automata (LGA). Based on our simulations we have developed a set of new equations to calculate fluid saturation from electrical measurements. The calculations from the new equations show very good agreement with laboratory measurements and published data.IntroductionArchie's equations1 (F=af-m and I=bSw-n,where a, b, m and n are constants and called Archie parameters.) have been the fundamental equations used to calculate fluid saturation of porous rocks from electrical well logs. There have long been questions and arguments about the true physical meaning of the Archie parameters, due to the fact that the micro pore structure, the flow of fluid and electrical current in a porous medium cannot be directly observed and controlled in laboratory measurements. In oilfield electrical logging data interpretation, non-Archie behavior of the porous rocks, i.e., the resistivity index-water saturation (I-Sw) relationship not being linear on a log-log scale, has been increasingly observed and reported by log analysts2 and petroleum engineers.Diederix2, Li3, Worthington4 and Jing5, among others, have studied this so called ‘non-Archie phenomenon' of porous rocks extensively. This ‘non-Archie phenomenon' generally becomes more evident as the water saturation further decreases. However, due to the limitations of macro scale laboratory experiments, it is not possible to quantify the factors that influence the I-Sw relation. Many researchers have tried to simulate the behavior numerically at the micro scale. Schopper6 used a resistor network to study the formation factor/porosity relationship. Yale7 developed a 3D pore network model to simulate the transport properties of porous rocks. Tao et al8 employed Yale's model to interpret electrical conductivity and elastic wave data simultaneously measured on fluid saturated sandstone samples. Man and Jing9 further developed Yale's model to account for the electrical transport properties of multi-phase fluid saturated porous media. Jonas et al10 employed a statistical network to study the physical basis of Archie's first equation. However, as these models do not simulate closely enough the real pore structures and fluid distributions, the theoretical modeling has only achieved limited success.In the last twenty years, Lattice Gas Automata (LGA) modeling for fluid dynamics has been developed rapidly. As pointed out by Rothman and Zaleski11, LGA permits accurate flow calculations at the microscopic scale for grossly irregular geometries. LGA has been successfully applied to model fluid flow in saturated porous media11,12,13. Kuntzet al.14,15 extended LGA simulation to apply it to Ohm's law and has shown that LGA also reproduces the physics of current flow and provides a means to study the dependence of the formation factor F on porosity and pore structure. He first used a 2-D lattice gas model to calculate the effective electrical conductivity of single-phase fluid-saturated porous media as a function of porosity and conductivity ratio between the pore-filling fluid and the solid matrix for various microscopic structures of the pore space. His results indicated that Archie's exponent m varies with the micro geometry of the pore space and could therefore reflect the microstructure at the macroscopic scale. The factor a of the power law, however, is close to 1 regardless of the microstructure. Yue and Tao16 recently studied the effects of matrix-pore geometry, pore-filling connate water and clay contents on Archie's parameters a, b, m and n with 2-D LGA. Contrary to the traditional viewpoints, it was found that the parameter m is not a measure of the pore structure complexity, but of the changing rate of the complexity with porosity. The parameter m is not constant, but a function of porosity and shaliness; the parameter a increases with the increase of shale content, while m decreases and b only changes a little. A new F-porosity relation was derived from their studies.

Abstract Permeability modification is used to improve volumetric sweep efficiency of fluid injection processes. The combination process, introduced by processes. The combination process, introduced by Needham, et al. in 1974, was envisioned to have unique properties. They reported that treatment of porous media with alternate slugs of polymer and porous media with alternate slugs of polymer and aluminum citrate solutions led to a decrease in permeability which was resistant to degradation permeability which was resistant to degradation after many pore volumes of fluid injection. Large permeability reductions were obtained using polymer permeability reductions were obtained using polymer concentrations as low as 250 ppm. This paper describes a study of permeability modification in sandpacks prepared from Ottawa sand using the aluminum citrate process which was undertaken to identify mechanisms causing permeability reduction and to improve process performance. Sandpacks with permeabilities between 1.73 and 2.92 darcies were used to eliminate the effects of clays on the process as well as rock heterogeneities. In the study, sandpacks saturated with brine were treated with alternate slugs of polymer, brine and aluminum citrate. Water Cut 160 and Water Cut 110 were the principal polymers used. Experimental results indicate that little permeability reduction occurred when a brine slug permeability reduction occurred when a brine slug separated the aluminum citrate and polymer treatments up to nine treatment cycles. Exclusion of the brine slug between aluminum citrate and polymer slugs in subsequent treatment cycles caused an abrupt reduction in permeability throughout the entire sandpack. Permeability was too low to be measured. Inspection of one sandpack after plugging occurred revealed the presence of a colorless, plugging occurred revealed the presence of a colorless, clear gell which adhered to the surface of the sand grains. Since similar gels were prepared at selected polymer and aluminum citrate concentrations in bottle tests, the permeability reduction mechanism appears to be in-situ gelation of Water Cut 110 by aluminum ion. This mechanism is quite different from the layered, aluminum/polymer network described by Needham, et al. and Thomas. Retention of polymer and aluminum was increased by an order of magnitude by cyclic treatment. However, retained polymer caused a small, if any, change in permeability prior to abrupt plugging of the sandpack. Retention of both polymer and aluminum involve processes which are polymer and aluminum involve processes which are rate dependent and are not understood. Introduction Interest in the improvement of volumetric sweep efficiency during waterflooding has stimulated development of processes which reduce permeability of porous rocks to brine. This permeability of porous rocks to brine. This interest is due in part to the unique properties of water soluble polymers as they flow through porous media. For example, when polyacrylamide is displaced through a porous rock by brine, the mobility of brine is usually reduced. Mobility reduction is caused by retained polymer, which decreases brine permeability. Retention and permeability reduction permeability. Retention and permeability reduction vary with the type of rock, amount of clays and rock permeability. In general, polymer retention and permeability reduction increase as permeability decreases. Polyacrylamides have been used in both waterflood injection wells and production wells to control water injection profiles or water production However, permeability gradually increases production However, permeability gradually increases when the retained polymer is exposed to large throughputs of water. Apparently the retained polymer is washed from retention sites by prolonged polymer is washed from retention sites by prolonged exposure to flowing fluids. Several approaches have been explored to increase the persistence of the permeability reduction. Sloat, et al. treated wells with a cationic polyacrylamide followed by an anionic polyacrylamide followed by an anionic polyacrylamide. Cationic polyacrylamide is retained strongly polyacrylamide. Cationic polyacrylamide is retained strongly and in large quantities by many reservoir rocks. The anionic polymer was thought to interact with the retained cationic polymer, leading to larger and longer-lasting permeability reductions. A process based on polymerization of a monomer process based on polymerization of a monomer insitu to form a polymer was developed for near wellbore treatments. P. 367

AB  - In this paper, Miles's variational formulation (Miles, 1967) is extended to study problems of water-wave scattering by steep slopes. In the procedure for obtaining the solution, the arbitrary bottom profiles are represented by flat shelves separated by abrupt steps. By applying the stationary condition of the variational formulation, a system of linear equations is obtained with unknown coefficients that represent the horizontal velocities. Our variational formulation is extended by considering the evanescent eigenfunctions in the representations of these horizontal velocities. The extended variational formulation is applied to solving water-wave scattering by using Roseau’s curved bottom profiles of both mild and steep slopes (Roseau, 1976). The solutions obtained by the extended variational formulation are convergent with Roseau’s analytical solution up to four decimal places for the mild and steep cases, while the solutions obtained by the traditional variational formulation (Miles, 1967) and the transfer-matrix method of Devillard et al. (1988) are not accurate enough for the steep case. Furthermore, by using the integral equation method, the improvement of the proposed method is enforced by two types of bottom profiles considered by Porter and Porter (2000). Finally, numerical experiments are performed to compare the present method with the extended mild-slope equation of Porter and Staziker (1995).

AB  - Abstract Recent discoveries offshore Brazil have induced a renewal of interest in the study of recent and ancient continental carbonate systems which developed in a wide range of depositional settings, reflecting aerial to subaqueous environments. Recent and ancient continental carbonate analogs provide some keys to depict the sedimentologic/sequential pattern observed at the core scale and help in the understanding of the impact of climate change, fluid flow and water chemistry on the carbonate factory. It is noteworthy that the widespread microbial development in continental carbonate systems occurs in stratigraphic intervals typified by specific climatic and geodynamic conditions, and sometimes coincides with similar development in the marine realm. Stromatolites are more developped in high water level condition. But comparative studies between intracratonic (Recent Great Salt Lake; Eocene Green River lacustrine systems) and rift lacustrine systems demonstrates that they are more extensive on a flat substrate. The control exerted by the topography may increase during abrupt alternations of arid and humid periods, influencing the water chemistry and, accordingly, leading to the development of anoxic and/or evaporitic conditions. The key issue is therefore to understand  the development of carbonate in lacustrine condition, how the sedimentary bodies and features can be preserved, and how their good reservoir properties can be maintained. High subsidence rate will influence the preservation potential of the relevant carbonate bodies, while the geothermal gradient, water chemistry or volcanic activity will impact the reservoir properties. In addition, meteoric or thermogenic travertine deposits, are an additional carbonate product that must be considered in the evaluation of continental carbonate reservoir systems.

AB  - Abstract The two-phase coning model of Settari and Aziz is used to predict the coningphenomena for two well in the Sylvan Lake, Pekisko B Pool, and the results arecompared with available history. Accurate and detailed information provided bythis model is used to explain some interesting aspects of the coning problem.The predicted results for suitably adjusted reservoir parameters are in goodagreement with field history even for a case where abrupt changes in productionrate occur. The reservoir parameters investigated here are: horizontalpermeability, vertical permeability near the well bore, and pressuremaintenance by water or oil influx.IntroductionWater coning into oil wells can affect adversely the performance of the well.Therefore, it is imperative to understand and be able to predict the influenceof the coning phenomenon on field performance. Also, by understanding cheformation and behavior of the cone, it may be possible to develop productionschemes which will counteract the influence of the cone.The most powerful tool for a full understanding of the coning phenomena is aproperly designed numerical model which solves the relevant partialdifferential equations on a digital computer. One such model has been developedat The University of Calgary. By a proper use of a computer model one mayinvestigate the influence of various reservoir and fluid properties, completionschemes and production schemes on the water-oil ratio. In this paper we presentresults of some studies of this type. Two wells, No. 4-15 and 10-16 in theSylvan Lake Pekisko B pool were selected for this investigation. Goodproduction history is available for these wells and they are typical ofdifficult-to-model wells often encountered. Before going into a description ofthe reservoir and the wells we mention some unique features of the computermodel used.Coning Model UsedSome aspects or this model are discussed in a recent paper by Settari and Aziz1. The model so1ves simultaneously the partial differentialequations for pressures in each phase by finite-difference methods. The modeldiffers from other published schemes in several important aspects:The grid-point distribution method is used2. This method placesgrid points at reservoir boundaries and block boundaries are determined byEquations (available in full paper)The reservoir-well bore interaction is carefully considered in this comingmodel. This is done by 1a) satisfying the condition that capillary plessuremust go to zero in the well bore, and (b) the pressure gradient in the wellbore must be compatible with the pressure gradient at the sandface. These twoseemingly obvious conditions have been treated properly for the first time bySetiari and Aziz 1. In addition to giving accurate results evenclose to the well bore, these conditions greatly improve the stability of thecoming model.A new approach is used Ear the treatment of Borne nonlinear terms in thismodel. In particular, this approach eliminates the necessity to literate e inorder to obtain good material balance.

AB  - ABSTRACTThe thermodynamic properties of hydrocarbons being studied by American Petroleum Institute Research Project 37 are outlined. The experimental methods used in their measurement are described in principle. Illustrative data are shown in graphical form. A number of applications of such information to the problems of petroleum production arc suggested.Physical ChangesThroughout the whole series of steps involved in the production and transportation of crude petroleum and natural gas, the conditions under which the hydrocarbon materials find themselves are almost continually changing. These changes of temperature, pressure, elevation or velocity may be gradual or abrupt; but in either case they result in corresponding changes in the properties of the complex mixtures of hydrocarbons. Since these processes involve changes in the volumes occupied, as well as changes in the pressures and temperatures prevailing, they must inevitably result in energy transfers as well. For these reasons the study of the fundamental principles of petroleum and natural-gas production and transportation leads directly to that branch of physical science called thermodynamics, which deals with transformations of energy between its various forms. The contents of petroleum pools are endowed with large amounts of energy due to the pressures and temperatures under which the fluids exist. This energy should -be utilized, as far as is economically possible, in doing many useful tasks. However, even by ideal operations, 'we could not hope to get benefits from all of this energy store, and that portion which should be readily available is easy to lose and dissipate in forms which are economically useless. If this tremendous endowment is to be properly utilized, it stands to reason that we must know something of, the behavior of these liquids and gases under changes of pressure and temperature- with particular reference to energy quantities. Only that portion of thermodynamics is needed which relates to the evaluation of energy transformations accompanying physical changes in systems consisting of liquids, gases, or both liquids and gases.Thermodynamic ValuesThe principal quantities with which one is concerned may ,be listed as follows, giving convenient symbols and units: Pressure, P, lb. per sq. in. absolute.Temperature, T, deg. F., absolute (called deg. Rankine).Volume, V, cu. ft.Heat content, H. b.t.u..Entropy, S, b.t.u.. per deg. Rankine The quantity called heat content is also known as \"total heat\" and as \"enthalpy.\" It is a very useful quantity, because changes in it indicate directly the amount of heat gained (or lost) by a system of constant mass during a change occurring at constant pressure, or the equivalent of the work done during a continuous- flow adiabatic expansion. Furthermore, throttling processes without addition of heat-such as often occur at valves where the pressure drop is large-are characterized by the heat content of the system remaining constant. The quantity called entropy serves to indicate how any given change in a system affects the ability of the system to do useful work. In a frictionless continuous flow process, the entropy change involved may be used to determine the amount of heat absorbed or given off.

AB  - ABSTRACTIn the Gulf of Mexico, a review of basin-wide spatial relationships between Early Cretaceous carbonate platform margins and olderstructures, combined with multi channel! seismic reflection data from the northeastern Gulf, indicates that a tectonic hinge zone controlled the margins' initial positions. There is no evidence that this hinge zone influenced pre - Early Cretaceous sedimentation patterns throughout the basin. Thus, we think that it formed during latest Jurassic - earliest Cretaceous time.Such timing suggests that the hinge zone is a new type of geologic structure. During this period, the Gulf of Mexico was undergoing onlythermal subsidence. The main phases of intracrustal extension and sea floor spreading, the stages of basin evolution most commonly associated with tectonic hinge zone formation at other divergent continental margins, had already taken place. We conclude that the hinge zone formed by processes until no w not thought to be associated with hinge zone development: the cessation of sea floorspreading in the central part of the Gulf and associated rapid subsidence of cooling oceanic crust in the basin's center. INTRODUCTIONDuring the Early Cretaceous (144-98 Ma), margins of shallow-water carbonate platforms nearly encircled the Gulf of Mexico (Fig. 1). The platforms have been studied extensively for their hydrocarbon potential1,2.. Nonetheless, one important question concerning these prominent geologic features persists: why didthe margins initially form where they did? An emerging consensus is that a tectonic hinge zone was a controlling factor; however, hinge formation and its role in basin evolution remain very ambiguous. Along Atlantic divergent continental margins, tectonic hinge zones occur widely and are interpreted as fundamental mechanical and thermal boundaries3-6. Commonly, these zonesare marked by abrupt increases in depth-to- [acoustic] basement and characterized seismically by on lapping overlying sequences5-7-8 (Fig. 2). The cause and timing of hinge formation remain poorly understood . Sawyer and Harry have related U.S. Atlantic hinge zone formation to a change in spreadinglocus that occurred halfway through the rift stage of basin evolution. Initially, spreading occurred landward of the future hinge zone then moved seaward of it, resulting in two spatially separated phases of extension and subsidence. Crust landward of the hinge zone was only affected by the first phase, while crust seaward of the zone experienced both phases. Because crust seaward of the hinge subsided more than crust landward of it, the hinge itself was created . When discussing tectonic hinge zones, "basement" needs to be defined. Since in this paper, we are evaluating basement as it is identified seismically, we subscribe to Klitgord and others definition of "acoustic basement" in the Gulf: a prominent reflection that can be identified and traced throughout the basinwhich forms the base of postrift and synrift sedimentary rocks. Buffler and Thomas" have termed this same reflection the "Mid-Jurassic Surface" an unconformity that is overlain and onlapped by Middle Jurassic and younger strata. In the Gulf of Mexico, Smithll was one of the first to suggest that initial margin position was controlled by a tectonic hinge zone.

AB  - JONES JR., FRANK O., PAN AMERICAN PETROLEUM CORP., TULSA, OKLA. MEMBER AIME Abstract The capabilities of small proportions of divalent cations, such as calcium or magnesium, for controlling clay blocking are reported. Potentially sensitive formations can be exposed to fresh water if at least one-tenth of the salts dissolved in both the native water and invading fresh water are calcium and magnesium salts. Often, even less suffices. The behavior evidently depends upon the cation exchange properties of the clays, which favor adsorption of calcium and magnesium over sodium. Clays having sufficient adsorbed calcium and magnesium resist dispersion by water and consequent blocking of permeability. An allied phenomenon, the dependency of clay blocking on salinity contrast, is also reported. Abrupt change from highly saline to fresh water can cause blocking which may not occur if salinity is lowered slowly. A process related to osmosis is thought responsible for this behavior. Applications of finding to drilling, fracturing and water flooding are discussed. Introduction Many formations, when exposed to fresh water, can lose permeability through clay effects. For example, drilling-mud filtrate can cause oil permeability decreases, which persist long enough to interfere with drill-stem testing and well completion. Ultimate productivity may suffer when clay damage is severe, especially if drawdown pressures are low.' The injection pressures and the time required for water flooding can increase if clay blocking occurs. Earlier work indicates that clay blocking is caused by obstruction of flow channels by clays or other mineral fines dispersed by fresh water. It is well known that increasing salt concentrations in water tends to prevent clay blocking. Also it is well established, although perhaps not as widely known, that the nature of the dissolved solids is also important. If, for instance, formation clays are exposed to calcium chloride solution and then exposed to weaker solutions of calcium chloride or distilled water, considerably less permeability damage results than if the clays had been exposed instead to sodium chloride solutions. The reasons for this behavior are: (1) clays are cation-exchange, or base- exchange, materials similar in this respect to zeolites or exchange resins, and (2) clays in the calcium form do not disperse easily in fresh water, whereas clays in the sodium form do. The base-exchange form of a clay is easily altered by flowing a solution through it. For example, a sodium clay can be changed to a calcium clay simply by passing a calcium chloride solution through the clay bed. There is general agreement that the reason calcium and magnesium clays do not disperse easily in fresh water is because the calcium ions do not ionize easily from the clay surfaces. Sodium clays, however, are believed to allow the sodium ions to ionize from the clay particle surfaces. In fresh water, this allows the particle to accumulate a net negative electrical charge great enough for the particles to repel one another and, therefore, disperse more easily. The foregoing suggests that, even in the presence of a large excess of sodium, a relatively small ratio of divalent cation, such as calcium or magnesium, might serve to prevent clay dispersion. The divalent ion probably adsorbs to a disproportionately large extent, because of being adsorbed more tightly, with the result that the proportion of divalent cation on the exchange positions of the clay might then be great enough for the clays to resist dispersion. Consequently, an investigation was conducted to find how mixtures of salts in solution influence clay blocking. APPARATUS AND PROCEDURE Water permeability tests were conducted using conventional techniques. The equipment is illustrated schematically in Fig. 1. Flow rates of solutions driven through small core samples at known temperatures and pressures were measured. Regulated compressed air, usually at 10 to 15 psig, was used to drive the solutions. Core samples 0.75 in. in diameter and I in. long were used for the most part. Cores were saturated by evacuating and then admitting a de-aerated solution. Tight core samples were first saturated with carbon dioxide gas and then evacuated and saturated with the test solution. After saturation, 140 psig pressure was imposed for several hours.

AB  - Abstract  We present results of monitoring studies on emergent coral reefs and submerged shoals, two potentially sensitive seabed habitats found within range of the modeled hydrocarbon plume from the 2009 Montara uncontrolled release in the Timor Sea. Divers conducted reef surveys 6 and 16 months after the release was stopped. Hydrocarbons were detected in surface carbonate sediments at very low levels and declined between the two surveys in both frequency of occurrence and concentration. While hydrocarbon degradation precluded source matching, some samples were consistent with a Montara type oil, but there was also evidence for multiple sources of hydrocarbons in the region. Coral and fish communities were in good condition and potential indicators of disturbance in some elements, for example moderate levels of coral bleaching observed in 2010, were related to unusually warm sea surface temperatures rather than distance from the well head platform or plume. The submerged shoals component targeted a series of nine discrete shoals ~30-150 km from Montara well head platform. The shoals have abrupt bathymetric profiles rising from 100-200 m depths to within 15-36 m of the sea surface. Sufficient light reaches these plateau environments to support benthic habitats for primary producers, including algae, corals and seagrass. Sampling used remotely deployed cameras and grabs.Benthic and fish communities were diverse and shared many species with shallow coral reefs. Hydrocarbon contamination was measured around the base of the shoals. While there was no conclusive evidence of a impact from the spill, spatial patterns in a subset of the fish data showed a reduction in abundance and diversity at shoals closest to the well head. Similarly a marked reduction in seagrass was noted on one shoal closest to the well head platform in the period between surveys, 6-16 months after the release was stopped. These observations may reflect an influence from the hydrocarbon release but could equally be the result of natural spatial patterns and disturbance events in the region. Overall, the lack of sufficient prior data characterizing the region, especially for the shoals, constrained insights into any effect or otherwise of the spill and reinforces the need for regional scale baseline data. These surveys make a significant contribution and an excellent starting point for baseline characterization of the broader suite of emergent reefs and submerged shoal habitats in the Browse Basin.

AB  - AbstractA novel compact oil-water separation concept using 2 hydrocyclones in series with recycle has been proven through laboratory testing and Nimr wellhead trials. The objective was to investigate the technical feasibility of using hydrocyclones at the wellhead to separate Nimr crudes prior to considering a downhole trial. With ‘light' Nimr crude, good water separation efficiency was achieved with a residual OIW better than conventional separation. With more typical heavy viscous crude, similar separation efficiency was attained but OIW levels were significantly higher. The technology provides a viable option for separation at the wellhead, for example prior to reinjection in water flood projects or where surface infrastructure is flow constrained. Reservoir benefits through improved pressure support or sweep could make the business case for downhole separation more favourable; however, it poses challenges to downhole monitoring and well architecture.BackgroundProducing reservoirs in Nimr area of South Oman contain viscous (400 cP), heavy (21 degAPI) oil underlain by strong aquifers. Field development is with a grid of horizontal producers, lifted by beam pump or Electrical Submersible Pump (ESP). The unfavorable mobility ratio of oil to water leads to rapid water breakthrough and production is required to high water cuts (98% BSW) to recover economic reserves. Increasingly large volumes of produced water result, with the 1999 rate of 150,000 m3/d, forecasted to double over the next 5 years. The current favoured disposal method is re-injection at a central location into the aquifer leg, downdip of producing reservoirs. Injectivity is sustained by disposing under fracturing conditions. The capital and operating cost of water disposal is consequently significant owing to the high injection pressures involved. In-field dehydration either at surface or downhole using hydrocyclones offers a potentially attractive alternative. Produced water lifting; processing and re-injection might all be improved, reducing disposal costs. Following lab testing, [ref. 1], a surface hydrocyclone trial was carried out in order to investigate the technical feasibility of using a hydrocyclone to separate Nimr produced fluids. Two ESP-lifted wells were tested: a typical 400 cP heavy oil (Nimr B) and a lighter 30 cP oil in a potential remote water flood development (Al Burj). The trial was designed and executed by a multi-disciplinary team from PDO, SEPTAR and Vortoil, who successfully bridged the technical and operational interface issues that were posed.Concept The hydrocyclone test unit comprises of a skid with 2 hydrocyclones in series with a recycle pump (Figure-1).

AB  - ABSTRACT: In the present study the penetration of grout in a rock joint is simulated using Computation Fluid Dynamics (CFD) and the two-phase finite volume numerical method. Also the fluid flow is considered as a transient flow. The grout is simulated as a real Bingham fluid using Herschel-Bulkley model. Applying saw-cut joints, various joint matedness and different tooth numbers in a specific joint length and changing the tooth height, the effect aperture variation and relative roughness are investigated. The results indicate that the penetration length is under the influence of fluid viscosity, joint aperture, grouting pressure and the grout yield stress. With increasing fluid viscosity, the penetration length decreases and the grouting time increases. The grout yield stress variations resulting more effect on the grout penetration length rather than the viscosity changes. Moreover the results indicate that the joint section was not completely filled by grout and in this simulation the penetration progress in the joint is cleanly illustrated. Decreasing of the joint matedness causes low grout penetration length. Decreasing the tooth height and the tooth numbers in a specific length leads in to low roughness of rock joint. 1. INTRODUCTION Grouting is a set of operations which in the course of it the grout is injected into the medium discontinuities under pressure. The main object of grouting is stated to be improvement of civil and mining working environments such as improvement of medium elasticity modulus, preventing ground settlement (reinforcement grouting) and etc. Furthermore, we can decrease medium permeability applying grouting to fill discontinuities, which is one application of constructing the grout curtain for dams. [1, 2] One of the paramount influential parameters during the grouting operation is to predict the grout penetration length. The grout penetration length is a function of the grout characteristics, medium specifications and the grouting technical execution limits. Several researchers have carried out majority of studies to predict the grout penetration length in a single rock joint. They mostly consider some presumptions to simplify the grouting operation. The obtained results mainly indicate direct influence of the grout pressure and the rock joint aperture but inverse effect of grout yield stress on the penetration length. [1] In the most of previous studies [3-6], the joint aperture is considered constant or to simulate aperture variations, joint is divided into sections with constant non-equal apertures which consequently yields instantaneous aperture changes and ignores abrupt pressure fall in aperture change spot. Also Bingham fluid behavior model is used to simulate the grout having two components namely yield stress ( 0 t ) and viscosity (μ) but practically the viscosity parameter is ignored to compute the grout penetration length. Furthermore, the grout flow is presumed as a steady state flow and then after satisfying stopping conditions the pressure distribution through the grout length is studied though the grout flow nature in the rock joint is completely transient. In the present study firstly a summary of previous studies on the field of grouting in the rock joints is presented.

AB  - Abstract Simulation models for foam enhanced oil recovery are of two types: those that treat foam texture or bubble size explicitly (population-balance models) and those that treat the effects of foam texture implicitly through a gas mobility-reduction factor. The implicit-texture models all implicitly assume local equilibrium (LE) between the processes of foam creation and destruction. In published studies most population-balance models predict rapid attainment of local-equilibrium as well, and some have been recast in LE versions. In this paper we compare population-balance and implicit-texture (IT) models in two ways. First, we show the equivalence of the two approaches by deriving explicitly the foam texture and foam-coalescence-rate function implicit in the IT models, and then show its similarity to that in population-balance models. Second, we compare the models based on their ability to represent a set of N2 and CO2 steady-state foam experiments and discuss the corresponding parameters of the different methods. Each of the IT models examined was equivalent to the LE formulation of a population-balance model with a lamella-destruction function that increases abruptly in the vicinity of the limiting capillary pressure Pc*, as in current population-balance models. The relation between steady-state foam texture and water saturation or capillary pressure implicit in the IT models is essentially the same as that in the population-balance models. The IT and population-balance models match the experimental data presented equally well. The IT models examined allow for flexibility in making the abruptness of the coalescence rate near Pc* an adjustable parameter. Some allow for coarse foam to survive at high capillary pressure, and allow for a range of power-law non-Newtonian behavior in the low-quality regime. Thus the IT models that incorporate an abrupt change in foam properties near a given water saturation can be recast as LE versions of corresponding population-balance models with a lamella-destruction function similar to those in current PB models. The trends in dimensionless foam texture implicit in the IT models is similar to that in the PB models. In other words, both types of model, at least in the LE approximation, equally honor the physics of foam behavior in porous media.

AB  - EFFECT OF BRINE-GAS MIXTURE ON VELOCITY IN AN UNCONSOLIDATED SAND RESERVOIR Abstract Gas in an unconsolidated sand reservoir encased in shale often results in a dramatic increase in amplitude of the seismic reflection from the shale/gas-sand inter- face. Unfortunately, reflection amplitude appears not to vary linearly with water (brine) saturation, and thus cannot be used to estimate gas quantity. Previously presented theoretical velocity computations, which demonstrate that compressional-wave velocity in an unconsolidated gas sand varies non-linearly with water saturation, qualitatively agree with laboratory velocity measurements on a sand specimen composed of pure quartz grains. However, significant departure of mea- sured and theoretical velocities at high water satura- tion indicates that assumptions for computing compressibility of the water-gas mixture are no longer valid. Résumé La présence de gaz dans un réservoir de sable non consolidé, encaissé dans un schiste, a souvent comme conséquence un accroissement spectaculaire de l'am- plitude de la réflexion sismique à l'interface du schiste et du sable contenant le gaz. Malheureusement, il semble que l'amplitude de réflexion ne varie pas d'une manière linéaire avec la saturation en saumure et ainsi ne peut pas être utilisée pour estimer la quantité de gaz. Dans le passé, on a publié des calculs théoriques de vitesse sismique qui démontrent que la vitesse des ondes de compression dans un sable non consolidé varie d'une manière non linéaire avec la saturation en saumure. Ces calculs sont en accord avec les mesures de laboratoire faites sur des échantillons de sable composé de grains de quartz pur. Cependant, des différences significatives entre les valeurs mesurées et théoriques des vitesses sismiques en présence de grandes concentrations en saumure montrent que les hypothèses utilisées pour calculer la compressibilité des mélanges de saumure et de gaz ne sont plus valides. 1.

AB  - AbstractThis paper presents the results of laboratory tests measuring typical gel system effectiveness in conformance control. The evaluated gel systems are a metal-complexed polymer system, an organic crosslinked-polymer system, and an in-situ polymerized system. All the systems are typical, commercially available systems used for water control in sandstone formations. The effects of temperature, differential pressure vs. permeability, and adsorption are investigated and quantified.The first set of core-flood experiments was performed with 1-ft long, 2-in. diameter Brown sandstone cores. The test temperatures were 140° and 240°F. The second set of experiments was run in a composite system with two 6-in. long, 1-in. diameter parallel coreholders. One coreholder contained a Brown sandstone core and the other coreholder held a Berea sandstone core. The permeability of the Brown sandstone core was 5 to 10 times greater than that of the Berea sandstone.The parametric studies carried out with these gels show the effect of differential pressure vs. permeabilitybehavior of the water-control systems during placementadsorption characteristicsthe effect of the gel systems on nontargeted intervals when placed without zonal isolationThe organic crosslinked-polymer system provided the highest gel-threshold pressure. The test results indicate an improved injectivity profile after an in-situ gelation treatment. The permeability of the untargeted intervals was also affected during nonselective treatments. A larger slug had a larger impact on nontargeted zones proportional to the zones' permeabilities. Therefore, zonal isolation is strongly recommended. Polymer adsorption on rock surfaces and sensitivity of the metal-based crosslinker to the chemical environment can reduce gel-system effectiveness.IntroductionWeather and environmental conditions that existed during the creation of a rock formation determine the formation's random anisotropic character. Macro- and megaheterogeneities are the primary causes of poor sweep efficiency during water- or gas-flooding applications. The random character of the permeability and porosity fields causes nonconformity problems and a low vertical and areal sweep efficiency, resulting in bypassed oil.Injection-profile modification and water and gas shutoff have been attempted with mechanical isolation, squeeze cementing, solid slurry (clay) injection, and oil/water emulsion and silicate injection. More successful results have been reported with in-situ polymerized systems, crosslinked polymeric solutions, and silicate-based gels. Some polymeric systems used for profile control are acrylamide and acrylate monomers, polyacrylamides (PAm's), partially hydrolyzed polyacrylamides (PHPA's), xanthan gum, carboxymethylcellulose, furfural-alcohol, acrylic/epoxy resins, silicate-based gels, and block copolymers.PAms crosslinked with chromium (III) carboxylate 1,2,3species are the preferred systems for conformance control. Typical chromium agents are chromium (III) acetate and chromium (III) propionate. If the objective of a gelant treatment is to increase the wellhead pressure or to divert the injected fluid toward the nonswept regions of a reservoir, then the plug should be formed deep in the reservoir. However, layer-average permeability can decease, reducing the chances of an abrupt change in the vertical distribution of the injected fluids. Both polymer and/or crosslinker adsorption in the near-wellbore region and dilution by dispersion during overdisplancement can reduce the effectiveness of the treatment. However, it total isolation or maximum blockage of an interval is required, the plub should be placed for a prolonged time in the near-wellbore region.

AB  - SPE Members Abstract This paper is an experimental investigation of reservoir parameters which influence CO2-induced organic deposition. A prototype high pressure/temperature apparatus is described which quantifies the onset and duration of heavy hydrocarbon flocculation, the extent of organic precipitation, and the alteration of wettability in porous media traps. CO2 is contrasted with pentane as a precipitating agent. Stainless steel filters were used to ascertain the role of miscibility, and to examine oil compositional effects. Native and treated Berea cores were utilized to probe the effects of initial rock wettability, brine, and clay activity. The results show that CO2-induced organic deposition resembles asphaltene precipitation by n-paraffins. Significant distinctions include that deposition using CO2 can be more extensive, is less abrupt, and is associated with liquid-liquid phase equilibria rather than the bubblepoint. The extent Of CO2-induced organic deposition correlates with pressure and temperature as they relate to the development of miscibility. Deposition caused by CO2 was somewhat inhibited by rich gas. Sufficient levels Of CO2-induced organic deposition typically made Berea cores less water wet and more oil wet regardless of the initial core wettability. Native cores could be altered to a mixed-wettability condition, and artificially neutral cores became strongly oil wet. The presence of brine reduced but did not eliminate CO2-induced organic deposition in strongly water-wet cores. Clays appear to be important deposition sites. Introduction Wettability is one of the more significant and complex parameters defining the distribution and flow of fluids in a reservoir. Reports show that rock wettability can be altered by adsorbable crude components, and that the degree of alteration depends upon oil composition, brine chemistry, surface mineralogy, pressure and temperature. Moreover, changes in wettability can improve waterflood performance, enhance the miscible displacement of waterflood residual oil, and explain lower than expected gas injectivities during CO2 flooding. The literature provides limited and largely qualitative data on the nature of CO2-induced deposition, although a tar-like solid phase has been routinely observed in phase behavior studies using CO2/reservoir-oil systems, and can plug consolidated cores undergoing CO2 displacement. Reports associate deposition of highly aromatic heavy hydrocarbons with the development of miscibility; thus, in CO2 miscible flooding, organic deposition characterizes the flood front rather than the swept zone. Numerous studies have examined the flocculation and adsorption of asphaltenes in the presence of excess n-paraffins. This paper uses a prototype high pressure/temperature variable volume circulating cell to provide detailed data on the reservoir parameters which influence CO2-induced organic deposition. This paper also begins to delineate the similarities and differences between asphaltene flocculation and precipitation stimulated by CO2. The following specific questions are addressed: 1. What is the role of multiple-contact miscibility? 2. Is deposition influenced by pressure and temperature as they relate to miscibility? P. 147^

Study on the change laws of electrical parameters of coal mass under load by using the method of combining mechanics and electricity and obtain the electrical parameter-strain curves in the process of uniaxial compression and the corresponding stress-strain curves. The experimental results show that in the process of instability and failure of coal mass, there is a clear anti-symmetry between the change law of stress-strain curve and that of resistivity-strain curve with its minimum value corresponding to the cracking stress of coals, and the resistivity of the low rank coal and the high rank gently decrease without appearance of abrupt change no matter what the structural type of coal samples belong to, however the resistivity of the medium rank coals abruptly decrease when external load reaches approximately 75% and 85% of compressive strength value for the tectonic coal and the undeformed coal, respectively. In addition, it is also observed that there is a maximum value corresponding to the cracking stress of coals for dielectric constant in all the dielectric constant strain curves and the dielectric constant strain curves of the tectoni

AB  - This reference is for an abstract only. A full paper was not submitted for this conference.   Several heavy oil fields in Oman are undergoing a rejuvenation using a variety of Improved and Enhanced Oil Recovery methods. The sandstone reservoirs, generally at a depth around 1000 meters, contain heavy oils with API gravities of 18-22, viscosities between 90- 400 cp and exhibit variable reservoir properties of around 20% porosity and 500-2000 mD permeability. Mobility ratios are adverse and all fields demonstrate early water breakthrough and high BSW under primary development. Fields with strong bottom waterdrive are redeveloped with a focus on cost effective infill drilling and water shutoff techniques. Good results have been achieved through segmentation of horizontal well bores with swellable elastomers allowing for targeted mechanical or chemical water shutoff. Innovative infill drilling technologies such as jet drilling and ultrashort radius are either ongoing or in preparation. Further increases in ultimate recovery through in-situ-combustion and high-pressure steam injection are being pursued. The fields with weak or no aquifer support are being redeveloped through waterfloods and chemical or thermal floods. Execution of a polymer project is ongoing with first polymer injection expected in 2008, following a very favourable waterflood response despite geological complexities and adverse mobility ratios. Studies are ongoing into expansion to other areas and a follow-up alkaline surfactant polymer flood. The redevelopment rationalized the existing infrastructure and provides support for waterfloods in satellite fields as well. Redevelopment of a second group of fields is being pursued through thermal methods. Steam injection tests are in final stages of preparation and will start in 2007, followed by phased full field developments. Given the specific reservoir and fluid conditions there are not always analogs and several of the developments pose unique challenges. The paper will present a status overview of several waterflood, polymer and thermal projects as well as key challenges and solutions.

AB  - Abstract The application of the recent technique of creating lateral tunnels by acid jetting into the formation has been a topic of discussion in Petrobras because it is a reliable, fast an economic way to increase the well productivity index in complex geology carbonate reservoirs. In order to evaluate this technology, a pioneer intervention was carried out in the Garoupa field on a typical offshore well in Brazil. The objective was to simultaneously increase oil production and decrease water cut, by creating lateral tunnels at specific points in the well open hole section. The number of tunnels created as well as their positions were defined as a function of both, oil and water saturation profiles. Also mineralogical and geomechanical analysis were conducted as well as rock dissolution on different hydrochloric acid concentrations, in order to determine tunnel perforation rate and hole stability, The application of this technology has generated important incomes to the oil operator and the same technique could be also applied on other different scenarios. This paper illustrates the process from selecting the well candidate, premilary laboratory tests, treatment designs and field operation to after treatment well production results. Introduction The well A produces from a open hole section in a limestone reservoir. This condition was decisive to choose this well as a pioneer on the application of this technology in Brazil. The tunnels are constructed, when the carbonate reservoir is diluted with 10%-15% HCl, using coiled tubing as a conductor and a jetting tool to drill. The main objective of this technique is to quickly and inexpensively increase the well drainage radius, consequently increasing the productivity index (PI). During the initial feasibility study of the operation on this well, it was analyzed rock mechanics data and acid solubility with sample cores from a correlated well. In these tests, it was observed that the minimum solubility of carbonate rock in HCl was above 95%, one of the prerequisites for this technique. It was also considered throught the geomechanical analysis the tunnel´s stability. Since the well before the intervention was producing with high water cut (BSW) the operational sequence also considered previous well production tests and production logging profiles, in order to have information from the saturation of fluids along the open hole section and identify the oil/water contact to better place the tunnels, and also for treatment evaluation purposes.

AB  - INTRODUCTIONThe presence of hydrogen sulfide (H2S) in well fluids imposes severe restrictions on the use of highstrength tubular goods because of sulfide stress cracking (SSC). The appropriate selection of materials for well completions is an important factor in the economic success of oil and gas production. The selection is determined by mechanical properties and is highly dependent on the corrosion cracking behavior of metals for the range of environments expected in service. Such knowledge is gained partly from service experience, but mainly from appropriate laboratory testing at the design stage. Laboratory evaluation of materials performance for sour service applications has been based largely on standard test methods such as those recommended by NACE International.1 One method based on the fracture mechanics approach (Method D, NACE Standard TM0177-901) has been used to identify the threshold stress intensity factor (KISSC) below which a material can be used safely and confidently. On the basis of the KISSC data, the operational limits of tubular goods for known defect sizes can be calculated, and the critical flaw sizes for the maximum cross section stress can be estimated for a specific grade and size of casing or tubing. Method D recommends using wedge-loaded double-cantilever beam (DCB) specimens and finding the equilibrium wedge load (P) at the abrupt change in slope of the load-displacement curve for specimens after their exposure in a sour environment. Unfortunately, P values usually have some measure of error and lead to wide scatter in the KISSC values.2-3 The objective of the present work was to outline a simple modification of the KISSC test method that eliminates the need for measurement of P and to evaluate SSC susceptibility of some low-alloy steels. Normalized and quenched and tempered steels for casing tubulars with different microstructures and strength levels were investigated. A modified KISSC test method was proposed, and the KISSC values for 947

AB  - SPE MembersAbstractThe objective of this paper is to quantify the distribution of potential flow units within valley-fill outcrop deposits by utilizing geostatistical parameters, especially variograms. The Newcastle (Muddy) Sandstone , which is a prolific producer in the Powder River Basin of Wyoming, is the subject of our outcrop reservoir characterization analysis which compares the relationships of detailed geological (sedimentological) interpretations of facies, detailed in situ permeability measurements, and outcrop gamma-ray log surveys. Much of the Newcastle (Muddy) Sandstone, which crops out near Newcastle, Wyoming was deposited by tidal currents backfilling valleys formed during a Lower Cretaceous sea level drop. The Skull Creek Shales which underlies and is lateral to the Newcastle sandstone forms lateral and bottom seals.We concurrently measured the permeabilities and gamma-ray responses of beds on three vertical transects with a grid extending normal to the bedding and three lateral grids which are as nearly parallel to the bedding as possible. We generated geostatistical parameters from these data sets. In all cases, Dykstra-Parsons coefficients are in the neighborhood of 0.35 for the single-unit data and above 0.8 for the multi-unit measurements. Coefficients of variation are below 0.5 for single units and above 0.8 for multi-unit data sets.Multi-unit variograms show hole effect and often strong trend, while single unit variograms always indicate nugget effect with a weak trend. The correlation between the plots generated from measured permeability and gamma-ray responses are impressive. Permeability and gamma-ray variograms are similar. The variograms in the vertical and horizontal directions are quite different. Therefore, they cannot substitute one for another. We also concluded that relative semivariograms are a better way of Presenting formation heterogeneities. We observed that abrupt variations in outcrop gamma-ray values are also excellent indicators of bed contacts.We used the generated geostatistical parameters in a simulated annealing program to predict permeabilities of lateral profile A, and concluded that variogram, mean and standard deviation are required but not sufficient parameters to predict the distribution of reservoir heterogeneity.IntroductionReservoir characterization seeks to identify reservoir compartments that manifest distinct properties in permeability, porosity, thickness, saturation etc.. Detailed description of reservoir compartments is a critical step in planning for performance predictions required for future investments. In numerous cases the completion, infill drilling, stimulation, and improved recovery operations were inefficient because of the lack of knowledge on reservoir heterogeneity, and the fact that the improved recovery processes are very sensitive to inherent uncertainties in the distribution of heterogeneities.Heterogeneity is a widespread feature in all naturally-occurring permeable media and one of the most important factors governing fluid flow. Reservoir heterogeneity, which is determined by variations in permeability, porosity, thickness, saturation, faults and fractures, and different facies/rock characteristics, is primarily the result of complex geologic processes that vary in time and space.An outcrop study is a useful tool for reservoir characterization because it allows analysis of the continuity of formations in three dimensions, and investigation of in-situ vertical and horizontal variations in properties on an inter-well scale. A reservoir characterization study of outcrop formations allows closely spaced lateral and vertical sampling which is necessary for the detailed rock description component of reservoir characterization. This detail can be used in planning advanced production processes applied to analogous subsurface reservoirs.The findings of any outcrop study should be checked for their applicability before it is applied to subsurface formations.P. 507

AB  - AbstractMechanical characteristics and energy properties of granite under uniaxial compression after high temperature have been researched. The results show that energy conversion during rock deformation and failure is a dynamic process, and it can be mainly divided into four subprocesses: energy input, energy accumulation, energy dissipation and energy release. Thermal damage defined by elastic modulus increases generally but has volatility, which can be fitted into cubic curve. Rock strength shows inverse ratio to dissipated energy and proportional ratio to elastic energy, energy dissipation makes the material deteriorate and its strength drop down eventually. Acoustic emission energy rate shows proportional ratio to elastic energy and inverse ratio to dissipated energy, the elastic energy released in rock volume plays the pivotal role of abrupt structural failure of rock. It is emphasized that the failure of rock is a process in which energy dissipation and energy release occur simultaneously. 1. IntroductionRock is a special geological material,which physical and mechanical characteristics affected by geology usually represent anisotropism and nonlinearity. Rock distortion and fracture is an energy dissipation irreversible process, so stress analysis can not reflect the law of rock failure. Rock may be failure in a stress range, stress is not the essence factor which token strength of rock. The token of rock strength must be considered from the energy dissipation and analyzed from the micro-defect evolvement during the entirely process. So far, some scholars have reasearched rock mechanical behavior under dynamic load, a lot of valuable fruits have been gotten. The inner link of rock energy dissipation, energy releasing and the whole structure stability have been studied by Xie he ping. Mechanical characteristics and energy properties of granite under uniaxial compression after high temperature have been researched. 2 Experimental Condition and MethodIn our investigation, we have used cylindrical rock specimens, 50mm long with diameters of 25 mm. There were 45 specimens in total, divided into nine groups with 3 specimens to each group. First, the specimens of each group were heated to the temperature of 25, 50, 100, 200, 300, 400, 500, 600, 700, 800, 900, 1000, 1100, 1200 and 1300° separately. In each case, the temperature was kept constant for 20 min so that the specimens could be heated to the assigned value from the outside to the inside and then the specimens were taken out and cooled down in the air. The experiment used displacement control mode, and the loading rate is 0.0015 mm/s.

AB  - ABSTRACT:This study presents the results of sensing remotely water surface fluctuations through images acquired by a charged coupled device (CCD) camera. A transfer function between the gray scales of the images and the actual wave profile was derived. It is shown that, for the case of regular waves, the relative errors estimated from this transfer function are, on the average, 0.16 and 0.006, for wave heights and periods, respectively, as compared with wave gauge measurements. However, the results for the cases with irregular waves are less satisfactory. The relative errors for significant wave heights from CCD images are 0.10, and 0.08 for the periods. Two different regions within the wave basin were used for this study to assess the universality and applicability of the transfer function. INTRODUCTIONMeasurements of ocean waves are often conducted using “in-situ” devices such as wave gauges and buoys. Generally, it can be said that accuracies of these kinds of measurements are relatively high. However, it should be noted that the underlying assumption of point measurements is that the wave field is homogeneous. These methods will, therefore, not be applicable for regions where wave properties may change considerably. These may include, wave field in a region where there are abrupt changes of the underlying topographies, or where there are man-made constructions nearby. In these circumstances, one has either to carry out measurements in various locations repeatedly, or to deploy a large amount of instruments. Furthermore, these instruments are liable to damages such as those caused by severe sea conditions, fishing activities and the passages of water vehicles. All these can be both time and cost demanding, as well as inefficient. In recent years there have been considerable interests in applying the technique of remote sensing for the study of ocean waves.

AB  - AbstractIn this paper we investigate experimentally the effect of surfactants on the formation kinetics of methane hydrate. The compounds tested include: anionic, cationic and nonionic surfactants. Experimental results indicate that surfactants (at concentrations levels near their CMC) do not influence the thermodynamics, however, they have a strong influence on the kinetics of gas dissolution in the water phase as well as on the overall rate of hydrate formation. In addition, the formed hydrate particles in the presence of the various surfactants exhibit diverse agglomeration characteristics. This work is part of an overall effort to develop the technology required for the safe operation of offshore oil and gas transportation pipelines without inhibitors. IntroductionUndersea oil and gas transportation pipelines in cold waters are often under thermodynamically suitable conditions for the formation of gas hydrates. Traditionally, the industry has designed pipelines and processing facilities to operate outside the hydrate formation pressure-temperature region. This is accomplished by the addition of inhibitors or by the dehydration of the gas/condensate fluids. However, this approach may be prohibitively expensive for offshore pipelines. We believe that a more economical approach is to allow the hydrates to form, and consider their transportation in the form of a slurry, where the formed particles neither deposit nor agglomerate. This paper addresses this problem by investigating experimentally the effect of surfactants on the formation kinetics as well as the physical characteristics of methane hydrate particles formed in the presence of surface active compounds. Surfactants are substances that when they present even at very concentrations, have the ability to significantly alter the surface or interfacial free energies. Therefore, surfactants should have a direct effect on the hydrate formation process. The formed nuclei in the presence of surfactants should have a different critical radius and hence, a higher surface area per unit volume of the system. The later may have a significant effect on the global formation rate under certain regimes of operation. Surfactants form colloidal-size clusters in solutions called micelles. The critical micelle concentration (CMC) is the minimum concentration of the dissolved surfactant above which the clusters (micelles) begin to appear in the solution. At CMC an abrupt change occurs in almost every physical property that depends on the size or number of particles in solution. This behavior is true for all types of surfactants - nonionic, anionic, cationic and zwitterionic - in aqueous solutions. The maximum reduction in surface tension occurs at CMC. As a result we decided to examine the effect of surfactants on hydrate formation kinetics when they are present near their CMC levels. The compounds tested include: anionic and nonionic surfactants. Freezing point depression experiments with thirteen surfactants showed that they do not have any measurable influence at concentrations near their CMC. P. 375^

AB  - ABSTRACTThe model for the degradation of the containers for nuclear waste includes three modes of corrosion, namely general corrosion, localized corrosion and environmentally assisted cracking (EAC). The objective of the current research was to quantify the susceptibility of five nickel alloys to EAC in several environmental conditions with varying solution composition, temperature and electrochemical potential. These alloys included: Alloy 22 (N06022), Alloy C-4 (N06455), Alloy 625 (N06625), Alloy G-3 (N06985) and Alloy 825 (N08825). The susceptibility to EAC was evaluated using constant deformation (deflection) U-bend specimens in both the non-welded (wrought) and welded conditions. Results show that after more than five years exposure in the vapor and liquid phases of alkaline (pH ~ 10) and acidic (pH ~ 3) multi-ionic environments at 60°C and 90°C, none of the tested alloys suffered environmentally assisted cracking. INTRODUCTIONThe current design concept for the high-level nuclear waste containers in the USA is based on a metallic multi-barrier system. This design specifies an external layer of Alloy 22 (N06022) and an internal layer or shell of type 316 stainless steel (S31603).1,2 The main purpose of the internal barrier is to provide structural integrity and to contribute to the shielding of radiation. The main role of the external barrier is to provide protection against corrosion. Alloy 22 was selected for the external barrier due to its excellent resistance to general corrosion, localized corrosion and environmentally assisted cracking in a broad range of environments.3-8 Alloy 22 is a nickel (Ni) based alloy that contains approximately 22% chromium (Cr), 13% molybdenum (Mo), 3% tungsten (W) and 3% iron (Fe). Because of its high Cr content, Alloy 22 remains passive in most industrial environments and therefore has an exceptionally low general corrosion rate. The combined presence of Cr, Mo and W imparts Alloy 22 with high resistance to localized corrosion such as pitting corrosion and crevice corrosion. After closure of the repository, the containers may suffer environmental degradation (corrosion). Dry corrosion of the waste package is expected to be negligible since the maximum temperature of the containers will be below 200°C. If water is present, there are three main aqueous corrosion mechanisms by which Alloy 22 may degrade. These include, (1) General, uniform or passive corrosion, (2) Localized corrosion (such as crevice corrosion) and (3) Environmentally assisted cracking (EAC) such as stress corrosion cracking (SCC). The purpose of the present work was to evaluate the EAC characteristics of Alloy 22 and four other nickel alloys in several environmental conditions using constant deformation U-bend specimens. The tested solutions were concentrated versions of ground water from the emplacement site. These solutions included: Simulated Dilute Water (SDW), Simulated Concentrated Water (SCW), Simulated Acidified Water (SAW) and Basic Saturated Water (BSW). The nickel alloys studied (in alphabetical order by UNS number) were: (1) Alloy 22 or N06022, Alloy C-4 or N06455, Alloy 625 or N06625, Alloy G-3 or N06985 and Alloy 825 or N08825. RESISTANCE OF NICKEL ALLOYS TO ENVIRONMENTALLY ASSISTED CRACKINGFrom the chemical composition point of view, corrosion resistant Ni-based alloys can be grouped into five families of alloys: (1) commercially pure nickel, (2) Ni-Cu alloys, (3) Ni-Mo alloys, (4) Ni-Cr-Mo alloys and (5) Ni-Cr-Fe alloys. Results reported in this paper are for three Ni-Cr-Mo alloys (N06022, N06455 and N06625) and for two Ni-Cr-Fe alloys (N06985 and N08825). Ni-Cr-Mo alloys are the most versatile nickel alloys since they contain molybdenum for protection

AB  - ABSTRACT: Load carrying capacity of a tubular member with a circumferential through-thickness crack is investigated. A series of pure bending tests is carried out. Based on the experimental results. a generation phase analysis is performed with the finite element method. in which both material and geometrical non-linearities are taken into account. Application phase analyses are also performed employing the J-integral and the Crack Opening Angle (COA) as parameters which rule the initiation and the continuation of a crack growth respectively. It has been found that a higher ultimate strength may be attained with higher critical values of J-Integral and COA and the decrease in load carrying capacity is strongly affected by the critical value of COA.INTRODUCTIONMany types of offshore structures have been built and in service to get seabed resources such as petroleum and natural gas. However, the connections of tubular members sometimes experience a fatigue damage due to small welding defects, large strain concentrations and cyclic wave loads. The denting damages caused by supply boat collisions or object fallings from a platform deck may also act as a crack initiator because of the large strain concentration at the bottom of the dent. In general, a material with sufficient ductility is used for legs and bracing members in offshore structures and the initiation of a crack does not lead to the immediate breaking of the cracked member. However, a crack usually grows under cyclic wave loads, and a plastic collapse or an abrupt breaking of a cracked member may occur when the structure is exposed to severe sea condition. The collapse of a cracked member may further cause that of other intact members because of the redistribution of internal forces, which may finally lead to an overall collapse of the structure.

AB  - ABSTRACT: Investigations were been performed to verify the competency of rock foundation of nuclear building founded in rock. In order to confirm that the in situ rock over the whole of the foundation excavation correspond to the conditions determined from the original subsurface investigations and used in the foundation design, the techniques were employed: visual observations, surface geologic and structural mapping, shallow cross-hole seismic measurements and laboratory tests. In this paper's are presented the results of the investigations performed and we concluded that cross-hole is one the most pratical precise tests of elastic in-situ rock parameters.1 INTRODUCTIONThe analysis of foundations and of soil-structure interactions in the design of nuclear buildings founded in rock require precise in-situ values of the dynamic elastic moduli of the foundation materials. These values are particularly important for wave propagation and finite element calculations, and where soil-structure interaction is a dominant factor in the response of the structure to dynamic loadings (Ballard (1972)).In order to verify that the dynamic properties of the in-situ rock over the whole of the foundation excavation correspond to the properties determined by the original subsurface investigations that are used in the foundations design, techniques such as visual observation, field tests and laboratory tests are employed.Ries et al (1980) concluded that visual inspection by experienced personnel is a most important factor in establishing the competency of a rock foundation. They also State that these further investigations and measurements provide the quantitative information required to substantiate the geologist's and engineer's opinion and serve to identify possible geological anomalies.2 CHARACTERISTICS OF THE ROCK FOUNDATIONStructural and lithological types and relationships were determined at an engineering site in Brazil through detailed site investigations comprising surface geologic and structural mapping, inspection and analysis of all subsurface data and detailed petrographical work.The principal and most widespread rock type at the site is a foliated augen gneiss. It is a leucocratic rock of granitic composition containing large megacrysts of feldspar elongated in the direction of the gneissic foliation.Aplites and diorites occur as small to medium sized intrusions in the gneiss, and some small pegmatitic dikes also occur. In general the contact between the different rock types is abrupt and welded, with no physical discontinuity between them.The gneissic foliation defined by the parallelism of the platy minerals and feldspar laths is oriented in a northeast direction. All other major structures such as joints, faults, lineations occur also oriented in the NE-SW trend. The dip of the structure is 70º to the north.Gneissic banding is locally common, parallel to foliation, where the rocks present parallel bands of layer of different minerals textures and colors.Light-colored bands of felsic composition alternate with dark-colored bands of mafic composition the former rich in alkalic feldspar and quartz and the latter composed predominantly of biotite.Although the rock is comprised of several lithological types, in general, all contacts are welded and the rock mass is fresh and little fractured (less than one fracture/m).

AB  - Abstract Although the oil industry seeks to increase the worldwide production of hydrocarbons, various well and reservoir problems can severely reduce oil and gas production from individual wells, leading to the requirement for intervention. For example, in mature fields offshore Brazil, production platforms with minimal open work space and without workover rigs have been a challenge for restoring production in wells with serious scaling problems. The scale build-up reduces production, month by month, until a rig has to be mobilized to replace the production string. Trying to recover production efficiently, service and operating companies have been presenting solutions that circumvent the practical limitations of these locations. In the last three years, an operator's engineering department has worked with service company engineers to develop the means to rig up a 1-3/4-in., 4500-m-long coiled tubing string in a work area of 234 sq. meters and with a crane with a 12-ton maximum capacity. This cooperation allowed intervention in wells on rigless platforms, reducing working time, environmental impacts and costs. These interventions helped to increase oil production from Field A in the Campos Basin and gas production from Field B in the Santos Basin, currently the most important gas field offshore Brazil. Both fields suffer from severe scale deposition -- barium sulfate in Field A and calcium carbonate in field B -- which builds up in the production string and effectively reduces the internal diameter, consequently reducing production. The new successful interventions in these fields using rigless coiled tubing and scale removal techniques enhanced the hydrocarbon production from these fields. In Field A (oil production), interventions were performed in seven (7) wells, providing around a 40% increase in production. In Field B (gas production), interventions were performed in five (5) wells, providing a production increase of around 27% per day. This paper details the planning, logistics and techniques used to successfully meet both challenges. The same solutions would apply in other fields around the world where platform space and scarcity of rigs limit an operator's ability to remediate scale or other wellbore problems that constrain hydrocarbon production. Introduction Market demand has sparked renewed interest in increasing oil and gas production from mature wells in Brazil for the last three years. The result has been an expansion in stimulation techniques using coiled tubing as a thru-tubing tool. Mature production wells, offshore Brazil, are located in both carbonate and sandstone reservoirs. Most of them are naturally depleted and heavy oil / high basic sediment & water (BSW) producers, with a carbonate, sulfate and paraffin scale deposition history. The choice for Coiled Tubing interventions seems to be obvious due to the speed of operation and almost immediate increase in incremental production without production interruption during operations. However, the barriers to project viability included crane lifting capacity, which hindered the ability to place the working reel onboard existing platforms, and the restricted working area available to execute the intervention (Fig.1) in wells ranging from 3500 to 5770 m total depth. Using the correct approach and planning procedures, and involving both service company and operator technical specialists, a new and innovative technique for rigging up and intervention was arrived at to overcome the existing obstacles.

AB  - AbstractThe flow behaviour of cement slurries, as measured with different types of equipment - a pilot-scale pipe viscometer, a Searl and a Couette coaxial cylinder viscometer - is analyzed. The dimension of the flow geometries, respectively pipe diameter and annular gap size, was varied to detect the presence of an apparent slippage at the wall, Different cement formulations were tested including a wide range of specific gravity from 1.7 to 2.2. Experimental flow slurries were also compared for a polymer solution, and two water-base bentonitic muds. For cement slurries. experimental results show that the flow curves obtained with the pipe and the Searl viscometer are very similar. The abrupt increase in viscosity at low shear- rates is attributed to the existence of a yield stress (Tv). For stresses lower than T,, flow is still observed in both cases. The size dependence of the flow curves indicates that such a behaviour can be attributed to an apparent slippage at the wall. For stresses higher than tv, little or no slippage is observable, and slurries exhibit a shear thinning behaviour that can be well fitted to a power law model from 30 to 500s. Different methods of calculating pressure drops in pipe flow from rotational viscometer data are presented. Their precision and limitations are compared. As a conclusion, it is established that laminar pipe flow pressure losses can reliably be predicted from rotational viscometer measurements if made on representative samples using equipment which minimizes particle centrifugation e.g. Searl systems instead of Couette systems. IntroductionIn the oil industry, the current practice for the rheological characterization of fluids is based on rotational viscometry The API I recommends the use of a coaxial cylinder viscometer, along with a very precise procedure for testing cement slurries, and indeed this technique gives quite repruducible results (table 1). However the physical significance of the results obtained has been questioned because the measurements were shown to be dependent on the gap size 121. A diameter dependency of the How curves was also found in pipe flow experiments. These phenomena were attributed to an "apparent slippage- at the wall, and they will be discussed in details for both pipe and coaxial flow of different cement and mud formulations. As far as coaxial flow is concerned, our experience is that particle migration due to centrifugal forces is by far the predominant factor affecting the rheological measurements on cement slurries. A reduction in the centrifugal forces. and therefore more reliable measurements, are obtained when rotating the inner cylinder - Searl viscometer illstead of the outer one - Couette viscometer - everything else being equal, The objective of the present paper is to validate this approach by comparing measured friction pressures in pipes, with the calculated ones from Searl and Couette viscometer data. Experimental investigation The rheological characterization of the tested fluids was performed using two rotational viscometers - a Couette and a Searl - and a pilot-scale flow loop. The Couette system is the Fann. The tests are run with geometry RIB1 (table 2) and spring 0.5, according to API specification 10. The Searl system is also a commercially available equipment- the CS100 from Carrimed. It has the peculiarity of being operated in constant torque mode instead of the usual constant speed mode. The torque can be applied with an accuracy of +/.01% between 10-5 and 10-2 N.m. P. 755^

AB  - This study of flow resistances imposed by gravel packing a cased well shows that the greatest resistance is often through the sand-filled perforations. Field test data verify that increasing perforation area perforations. Field test data verify that increasing perforation area can increase productivity. IntroductionCreole Petroleum Corp. produces from several unconsolidated or poorly consolidated reservoirs of Miocene age that require a sand control treatment at some time during their producing life. Initial attempts to control sand employed various wellbore bridging devices that either were unsuccessful at controlling sand production or severely restricted well productivity. Preperforated pipe, for example, did not productivity. Preperforated pipe, for example, did not provide adequate sand control, so that wells had to be provide adequate sand control, so that wells had to be produced at low rates. Screen liners with openings produced at low rates. Screen liners with openings larger than 0.01 in. did not prevent production of sand and when 0.01-in. openings were used, severe plugging and restriction of flow occurred. plugging and restriction of flow occurred. Gravel packing, which Creole started using as a sand-control measure in the early 1950's, had become the standard method of controlling sand by the late 50's. Gravel-pack completions normally are of the following types: open-hole gravel pack, inside casing gravel pack, or inside casing gravel pack with a high-pressure sand squeeze preceding the gravel pack (see Fig. 1). The open-hole pack is used when the completion is in a single sand or when multiple sands can be produced without fear of gas or water production. The cased-hole pack is most often used when production. The cased-hole pack is most often used when multiple sands are to be produced through a single tubing string. The relative productivity of the various completion techniques is illustrated in Table 1, which presents measured productivity indices data for presents measured productivity indices data for two reservoirs. Note that wells completed with a gravel pack inside a cased hole have severely limited productivity. productivity. Although many things influence production from gravel packed wells, two of the main limiting factors are (1) invasion of fine formation sand into the pack and (2) flow restrictions imposed by the gravel-packing operation. These mechanisms are illustrated by production data shown in Fig. 2. The well was production data shown in Fig. 2. The well was initially completed with a cased hole and perforated with four 1/2-in. perforations per foot of sand. After flowing for several months at about 2,000 BOPD the well began to produce sand. The treatment used to control the condition consisted of a high-pressure sand-oil squeeze (SOS) and inside gravel pack (IGP) retained by a slotted liner. In conjunction with this treatment, the well was equipped with gas-lift valves and afterwards was produced by gas lift. The abrupt drop in rate following the sand control treatment is associated with the restrictions to flow imposed by the gravel-packing operation and was probably caused by plugging of the gravel pack probably caused by plugging of the gravel pack by formation fines. To combat the problem, smaller gravel is used, so that currently it is about five to six times the size of the smallest formation sand in the 10 to 70 percentile region of the distribution. This selection procedure is similar to that proposed by Schwartz and by Maly and Krueger. Formation sand size distributions and the gravel size that would be selected to control sand are illustrated in Fig. 3. In this example, the grain size ratio is about 5.1 at the 10-percentile point, 5.7 at the 40-percentile point, and 6.1 at the 70-percentile point. JPT P. 419

AB  - INTRODUCTIONPrevious studies have reported on the effect of ion beam surface modification on pitting behavior of pure aluminum.1-12 Ion implantation is a process by which virtually any element can be introduced into the surface of any solid material by directing a beam of high-velocity ions (tens to hundreds of kiloelectron volts) at the surface of the material to be modified. Some useful properties of ion implantation for possible corrosion applications are: -- The surface of a metal can be alloyed without altering the bulk properties; -- Solid-solution surface alloys can be formed that exceed the solubility limits of the implanted species; -- There is no problem with adhesion of the surface layer, as there is with a deposited coating, since there is no abrupt interface between the implanted surface region and the substrate; and -- Ion implantation provides a means of conserving scarce, expensive, or critical materials by concentrating them in the near-surface region of the metal. Previous work has shown that implanted silicon, molybdenum, tantalum, niobium, zirconium, or chromium all increased the pitting potential of aluminum in 0.1 M sodium chloride (NaCl).1-4,9 The purpose of the present work was to report on the effect of nitrogen on pitting behavior of aluminum in view of earlier work and because it is well known that nitrogen additions to stainless steels (SS) improve their pitting resistance.13-16 Recent work has shown that nitrogen implantation into type 304L SS (UNS S30403)(1) also is beneficial.17-18 There have been a number of studies on the surface analysis of aluminum or aluminum alloys implanted with nitrogen;19-21 but there have been only a few studies on the resulting electrochemical behav-

AB  - Abstract Sand production in unconsolidated formations has brought heavy injury for the oil and gas industry around the world. Million dollars have been invested in sand control techniques. Among the several sand control systems existing, Open Hole Gravel Pack (OHGP) is the one adopted for horizontal well completions in the offshore Brazilian fields. With the experience in the development of such fields, some assets start to consider the adoption of less conservative sand control strategies, such as the use of stand alone premium screens (SAS). The present work proposes a methodology for evaluating the impact of the sand control technique in the productivity or injectivity of a horizontal well. Several parameters, such as damage rate (DR) and productivity or injectivity index per horizontal effective length (PI/Lef) were used to compare similar wells equipped with different sand control techniques. The main goal of the study is to address the following questions: There is any formation damage due to the gravel pack during production lifetime of a well? The wells equipped with stand alone screen exhibit formation damage? Wells equipped with OHGP have the same performance when compared with wells equipped with SAS? Stand alone completion is a good alternative path for multilateral and extend reach wells? Introduction Maximizing well productivity / injectivity is pursued by many ways: through sand management (Mathis 2003, Oyeneyin et al, 2005), sand and water management (Nguyen et al, 2007), by using suitable completion fluids (Milhone, 1983) to prevent well completion damage, by ICD screens implementation (Fernandes et al, 2006; Wibawa et al, 2008) or during drilling operations using sophisticated tools in horizontal well placement technology (Altman et al, 2007). The specific topic of this paper deals with the impact of sand control strategy on well completion efficiency. Different operators have different views on the criteria of investing on sand control techniques or sand management in onshore environments. On offshore scenarios, especially in deepwaters, it seems that there is a common sense that sand production is a major issue and should be avoided. All the efforts should be spent to minimize equipment erosion and production interruptions to clean surface separation systems. PETROBRAS defined that all offshore wells in non consolidated sandstones should be equipped with adequate sand control techniques. Perforation of cased and cemented horizontal sections did not appear as an economical alternative and, consequently, open hole completion with sand control techniques was the path to follow for horizontal wells. Tiffin et al (1998) defined a criterion for screen type selection, while Bennett et al (2000) stated that, for offshore wells with water depths greater than 500 m, openhole gravel packs with and premium screens are recommended. This guideline is based on the concept that, for long life cycle wells, additional barriers to prevent production interruption and avoid or postpone workover jobs should be considered. The first horizontal wells in unconsolidated sands in Campos Basin were completed with Stand-Alone-Syntherized screens. At that time the industry were not capable to support the requirement of an additional barrier for sand control in open hole horizontal sections. Motivated by the increasing demand for the activity and by failures in the wells equipped with syntherized screens, the service companies rapidly developed more reliable sand control solutions for the offshore environments: premium screens and gravel pack tools were soon available and the strategy proposed by Bennett was promptly adopted as a global criterion for offshore fields in PETROBRAS.

AB  - SummaryThis paper describes applications of wireline stress measurements based on the microhydraulic fracturing and packer fracturing techniques.New testing and interpretation procedures have been developed. These procedures make it possible to obtain reliable measurements of the minimum horizontal stress and also the maximum horizontal stress in a near-vertical openhole environment, or to conduct tests in a cased-hole environment.Examples of stress tests carried out in a wide range of formations are presented, with applications to the design of hydraulic stimulations, the stability of deviated wells, screenless completions for sand control, and enhanced recovery programs.IntroductionThe need for more detailed stress measurements has increased over the past decade. Knowledge of the value of the minimum principal stress and possibly its orientation used to be the only input the oil and gas industry required in term of stresses. Today, more applications benefit from information on the complete stress tensor (i.e., the value of the three principal stresses and their orientation).The goal of stress measurements is to measure the value of the minimum principal stress ?3 and possibly its orientation. The measurement should also yield values of the "far-field" stresses (i.e., undisturbed by the wellbore). More detailed measurements should yield the value of the intermediate principal stress ?int and possibly that of the maximum principal stress ?max together with their orientation. Various techniques have been proposed to measure the in-situ stress (for a review, see Ref. 1). These techniques include overcoring, analysis of focal mechanisms of induced seismicity, size of breakouts, and core relaxation (differential strain curve analysis and anelastic strain recovery). The stress measurements presented in this paper are based on the microhydraulic fracturing technique. It is the best-known technique to measure stresses at great depth,2 although it can be used in conjunction with other techniques for added completeness.3 This technique uses the pressure response obtained during the initiation, the propagation, and the closure of a hydraulic fracture (Fig. 1).This technique has been most successful in measuring the value of the far-field minimum stress in low-permeability rocks. In this paper, we report solutions to the challenges posed by extending stress measurements based on the microhydraulic fracturing technique to test both impermeable and very permeable formations and to access more information about the stress tensor than just the value of the minimum stress.After some theoretical considerations, we describe the hardware and report the developments in testing procedure and test interpretation. Then, for each new application, we list the corresponding challenges and the proposed solutions, followed by an example.Note that the analysis presented here is based on the framework of linear elasticity. Recent work4,5 has shown that nonelastic behavior of the formation may yield to estimates of the stresses that are too low.Testing a Fracture to Measure Stresses Let us first mention the relation between a fracture and a wellbore placed in a medium subjected to a triaxial stress field.Closure Stress and Minimum Principal Stress.Let us consider a fracture filled by fluid at a constant pressure and loaded by a constant stress. The width of the fracture is zero if the pressure of the fluid in the fracture is equal to that stress. If the stress acting on the fracture surface is not constant, the constant fluid pressure at which the fracture opens or closes at the wellbore is a weighted average of that stress. The value of this pressure is called the closure stress. If most of the fracture surface is loaded by a constant stress, the closure stress is a good estimate of that constant stress. The goal of stress testing with the microhydraulic fracturing technique is to develop a fracture with a closure stress as close as possible to the far-field principal stress ?3 for which we seek to determine the value.Closure stress cannot, however, be measured because constant fluid pressure in the fracture cannot be achieved in practice. What is measured is the pressure at which the fracture opens or closes at the wellbore during hydraulic tests. It is detected by looking at abrupt changes in the flow regime associated with the abrupt changes in fracture conductivity when the fracture opens or closes. For this pressure to be as close as possible to an estimate of the closure stress, it is desirable to measure fracture closure or reopening when the fluid in the wellbore is as close as possible to the pressure in the bulk of the fracture. This is best achieved when the fluid injection (or withdrawal) rate is zero.These considerations led to development of the procedure described in more detail in this paper. A hydraulic fracture is repeatedly tested and extended. At each stage, various estimates of the closure pressure are determined. Reconciling all estimates for all stages leads to estimation of the closure stress. Finally, other information such as the density of the sediments or wellbore images can be used to assign the estimated closure stress as an upper bound, lower bound, or fair estimate of a far-field principal stress.EquipmentThe tool used to perform the stress tests reported in this paper is the wireline-conveyed MDT* modular formation dynamics tester. This tool, which uses motorized valves, is of modular design and entirely software controlled. The configuration used for stress testing includes the packer module, pumpout module, and flow control module6 (Fig. 2).The packer module isolates a 3 ft section of the wellbore for testing. Pressure in the packers and in the test interval is recorded simultaneously and can be displayed for analysis in real time.The pumpout module can be used to pump fluid from the mud column either to the packers or to the interval. A new pump was developed specifically for stress testing. This pump delivers a maximum flow rate (about 3 L/min) if the pressure difference between the inlet (mud column) and the outlet of the pump (packer arrangement or interval) is less than 150 psi for quick packer inflation. It then delivers a smaller flow rate independent of the differential pressure for better real-time control of the tests. That flow rate can be controlled by changing the speed at which the pump operates to a maximum of 1.1 L/min.The flow control module is used to withdraw fluid from the interval at a constant flow rate.

AB  - Summary In this study, we have investigated the turbulent flow of water over the sandbed deposited in a horizontal eccentric annulus. The primary objective was to determine the effect of the presence of a sandbed on the parameters strongly involved in the bed-erosion process, such as the local fluid-velocity profiles near the interface, the equivalent sandbed roughness, and the average and the interfacial friction factors. The particle-image-velocimetry (PIV) technique was used to measure the velocity distribution at the water/sandbed interface. The bedload transport of particles caused an abrupt increase in the equivalent sandbed roughness. Analyses of the velocity profiles in the wall units confirmed that the sandbed roughness is variable and can be several times greater than the mean particle size. The interfacial (fi) and the average friction factors (fa) were evaluated and compared with flow under the stationary-bed and the bedload-transport conditions. The interfacial friction factor increased dramatically at the onset of the bed erosion. We have also found that depending on the bed height (or the surface area of the bed at the interface), the interfacial friction factor can be significantly different from the average friction factor. The results presented here provide much-needed experimental data for the validation of the mechanistic, semimechanistic (empirical), and numerical [computational-fluid-dynamics (CFD)] models of the bed erosion process. The major conclusion of the study is that the difference between the average and interfacial friction factors should be taken into account for more-realistic multilayer modeling of the hole cleaning.

AB  - ABSTRACTWe performed numerical experiments on the harbor resonance of secondary oscillations to quantify the effects of tidal motion. Two bay shapes were tested: one rectangular and the other L-shape. Trains of 10 sinusoidal waves with varying periods and different initial input times relative to tidal motion were input from the offshore open boundary to generate secondary oscillations. Based on these simulations, the asymmetric characteristics of the harbor resonance were found. The maximum wave height of the secondary oscillation became largest when the secondary oscillation started during the falling tide and when the period was slightly longer than the eigenoscillation under mean sea level.INTRODUCTIONA secondary oscillation is a sea level oscillation of subtidal-scale period between several minutes and 2-3 h, which includes the so-called tsunami frequency band. Although the amplitudes of secondary oscillations are usually only of the order of centimeters, they can become amplified to greater than a meter in some bays. An atmospheric pressure wave is one of the driving forces that can cause such large amplification. In recent years, long waves with such large secondary oscillations have been referred to as meteorological tsunamis or meteotsunamis (e.g., Monserrat et al. 2006).There are multiple mechanisms for the amplification of meteorological tsunamis travelling from the open ocean into a harbor. Proudman (1929) resonance is the one of the most significant mechanisms generated when the speed of the sea level pressure disturbance is of the same magnitude as the phase speed of the ocean long wave. Similar to seismic tsunamis, the heights of such waves are increased by shelf amplification. Harbor resonance is the most important mechanism affecting the increase of wave height within a bay.Various meteorological conditions can generate sea level pressure disturbances, such as perturbations along a stationary front (Tanaka, 2010), mesoscale convective systems such as a derecho, and downdrafts of dry air from the mid-troposphere. In addition to abrupt pressure jumps, a train of small pressure waves with amplitudes of 0.5–1.0 hPa can sometimes generate amplified oscillations of 1.0 m or higher (Tanaka et al. 2013).

AB  - AbstractThe effects produced on velocity logs by acoustic signal variations as they are related to the geometry of the borehole and sonde are discussed in this paper. All presently used velocity logging devices measure the time required for an acoustic wave traveling in a borehole to assume successively at two closely spaced depths a certain arbitrarily chosen amplitude. The indicated specific acoustic delay, or reciprocal velocity, is a function not only of the velocity of the formation, but also of the character of the acoustic wave at the two depths. Shell Development Co. has developed a device which records both a log of acoustic delay vs depth and an oscillogram record of the acoustic signals produced within the borehole. The oscillogram records provide a continuous calibration of the logs and afford an opportunity for evaluating basic data. The logs and oscillogram records are described and illustrated.Oscillogram records and laboratory experiments indicate that acoustic signal variations related to geometrical factors can have a significant effect on the accuracy of velocity logs. Borehole signals can be classified as early arrivals if they represent waves having the velocity and travel path of first-arriving compressional waves. Signals not satisfying these conditions can be termed late arrivals. It appears that the amplitude of early arrivals may be greatly reduced by interference effects where the borehole is enlarged, where there is a deep disturbed zone in shale, or where there is an abrupt diameter variation. These interference effects may cause erroneous readings on the velocity log. The best method of avoiding these errors is to measure travel-time between early phases of the received signals. The use of later phases is not likely to produce substantial errors in sands and carbonates but may do so under unfavorable conditions. The use of centralizers reduces these interference effects.Late-arrival signals generally have large amplitudes and are observed only on oscillogram records made with reduced amplification. In presently used instruments, these signals represent waves which travel with the velocity of first-arrival waves but with different travel paths; or they represent waves which travel with a velocity slightly lower than that of drilling fluid. Interference between these signals and early arrivals will produce phase shifts which may result in erroneous indications on the velocity log if the late arrivals are used to measure travel-time. Again, the method of avoiding these errors is to measure travel-time between early phases of received signals.

AB  - ABSTRACT:In contrast to classical logic systems, fuzzy logic is a technique of reasoning by "cheap" approximations, significance and human-like terminologies rather than by the "expensive" exactness and precision. The technique is based on the fuzzy set theory and is considered a handy tool for quantifying vagueness. This paper combines the fact that sanding can sometimes benefit the well-reservoir system with the need to keep its intrusion into the wellbore at a tolerable level to create a fuzzy sanding controller. The system monitors the sanding level and its rate of change; and adjusts the choke valve accordingly. Fuzzy logic resulted in a smooth/continuous solution no matter how the input varied within the universe of discourse (domain) and/or crossed boundaries between (fuzzy) sets. Thus, the technique allowed the machinery to operate in small refinements, avoided creating any abrupt changes to the drawdown, and secured the stability of the system.INTRODUCTIONSolids production in wells costs the industry several hundred-million dollars each year in remedial and repair works. Although it is thought of as a detrimental process, sanding is in fact a stabilizing mechanism of the well-reservoir system as well as a stimulation process as it definitely increases the reservoir's effective permeability provided the sand inflow can be handled safe]y, is tolerable, and is relatively stable and/or decreasing with time. In addition, if beforehand one knows that mother hatuns is able to reach a stable geometry downhole, early in the life of the well, none of the remedial, (permanent) production reducing measures would need to be implemented.Sanding is a result of the well's natural tendency to adjust to the mechanical stress concentrations in addition to the stresses created by the flow of fluid through the formation. Therefore, sometimes limiting the production rate will reduce or even eliminate sand production as well. Laboratory, field experiments and theoretical analyses have shown that sand production can be minimized by reducing the production rate to the critical or sand-free level, i.e. to the level where the drag forces are overcome by the sand's natural cohesive forces. If, under these circumstances, the production rate is high enough, no further sand control measure may be necessary.Drawdown reduction (DR) is very rarely used as a basic sanding treatment approach. The technique is more commonly borrowed to assist other sand-exclusion measures in the field; thus, yielding a more feasible payback. Moreover, DR is one of the recommendable remedial measures of an in-house sand inflow treatment-expert, prediction, and analysisoftware, SITEX-pa (Kanj et al.,1997).This study is mainly concerned with the development of a fuzzy well-drawdown controller. Starting with a short introduction to the topic of fuzzy-logic, this paper moves on to describe the development of the system and then to highlight its features and advantages over other conventional methodologies in the same domain of sand-control. One validation process of the developed code is briefly portrayed at the end of this manuscript. The approach is borrowed from the fluid dynamics discipline.

Reserves explored in the region amount to ~11 percent of oil, ~14 percent of natural gas, and ~16 percent of gas condensate reserves of Russia. However, East Siberia is currently producing no more than 0.3 percent of Russian oil and about 1 percent of gas [1]. Major causes of such a low production level include remoteness of the region, poorly developed infrastructure, complicated geology, numerous faults, high mineralization of formation water in pay zones, etc. The largest oil- and gas-bearing object of East Siberia is the Vendian terrigenous complex, which transgressively and discordantly overlies the eroded surface of Riphean rock. The complex is represented by the Parfenovskiy Horizon (the Kovykta Field), the Vanavarskaya Suite (the Sobinskoye Field), the Verhnechonskiy Horizon (the Verhnechonskoye Field), the Botuobinskiy Horizon (Srednebotuobinskoye and Chayandinskoye fields), etc. The present publication focuses on our experiences of applying geosteering to drilling in the Verkhnechonskiy Horizon interval of the Verkhnechonskoye oil and gas condensate field. The key specific feature of the Verkhnechonskiy Horizon reservoir is its almost all-round yet very uneven Salinization [2]. Moreover, some of the rock series contain significant volumes of accessory minerals of anomalous physical properties [3]. Risks of drilling horizontal wells in poorly productive intervals are significant due to highly abrupt variability of reservoir rocks of the terrigenous complex in interwell space. With application of LWD, it is possible to drill horizontal sections of wells through the most favourable subsurface zones and to obtain reliable determinations of resistance-contrasting boundaries of formations along the entire wellbore [4]. It is generally an adeqaute condition for timely adjustment of well trajectories and for keeping wellbores within target interval boundaries. Geosteering makes it possible to achieve a 10 percent increase in penetrating the best reservoir by horizontal wellbores in comparison with the originally designed wellbores. The average total effect of geosteering in more than 20 wells came to 67 tpd per well. Subject of the Study The Verkhnechonskoye Field is located in East Siberia within the Mid-Siberian high plateau boundaries (Figure A-1). As bulk of the oil reserves is associated with Vc1 and Vc2 formations, determination of reservoirs, evaluation of reservoir saturation and quantitative assessment of rock porosity and permeability properties are especially challenging in studies of the Verkhnechonskiy sediments. Therefore, development of new methodological approaches to enhance geological efficiency of various methods applied to studying the profiles of the Verkhnechonskiy sediments should be a priority. In the Verkhnechonskiy Horizon, deposits were formed and sediments were accumuled in submontane and possibly coastdeltoid environment. Diagenetic and catagenetic transformations and metasomatism processes led to high heterogeneity of both mineral composition of the rocks and the complex structure of the rocks' pore space. In view of the above factors, petrophysical modelling of rocks and reservoirs of the Verkhnechonskiy Horizon is significantly complicated, while ‘conventional' approaches based on logging demonstrate lower effectiveness when applied to quantitative assessment of rock porosity and permeability properties, and uncertainties are abundant in geological modelling.

AB  - ABSTRACT:This paper describes a model that predicts the moduli for brittle rock loaded by compressive principal stresses. All inelastic deformation is assumed due to microcracks that open under local tensile stresses caused by small scale heterogeneities. For axisymmetric loading and an isotropic initial distribution of cracks, the model predicts that crack growth begins in the axial direction and expands to a cone of angle 12-15 as loading continues to peak stress. The macroscopic response evolves from isotropic to transversely isotropic and the elastic moduli decrease with ongoing deformation. For combined axisymmetric compression ) and torsion axial loading causes the damage surface in vs. space, separating stress states causing unloading from those that cause continued damage, to evolve from an ellipse to a surface with a sharp vertex at the current stress point.1 INTRODUCTIONUnderstanding the localization of shear deformation into narrow zones is essential to predicting macroscopic rock fracture in compression, progressive reduction in load bearing ability (strain softening behavior) and the evolution of faults and certain other geologic structures, e.g., kink bands. Understanding highly localized deformation is also essential for predicting complex failures around underground excavations and boreholes where the mode and extent of rock decrepitation cannot be described by means of conventional yield or fracture criteria. The onset of localization typically involves an abrupt change in the deformation pattern or, in other words, in the orientation of the principal axes of the rate of deformation. Consequently, attempts to predict the onset of localization in terms of the constitutive description of homogeneous deformation (Rudnicki and Rice, 1975) are strongly dependent on the moduli governing such abrupt changes in the pattern of deformation. These moduli are, however, difficult to measure in experiments. The goal of this work has been to predict these moduli using a macroscopic constitutive relation based on the inelastic deformation caused by the growth of tensile microcracks. 2 MICROCRACK GROWTH MODELOur approach has its origin in a model of Costin (1983a, 1983b, 1985). He proposed an ad hoc expression for the local tensile stress that arises due to microscale inhomogeneities. These inhomogeneities may include neighboring grains with different elastic constants, grain boundaries, or sliding frictional cracks with opening wing cracks. Regardless of the details of the microstructure, these inhomogeneities have the effect of creating local tensile stresses that drive crack growth even when all the applied principal stresses are compressive. Costin (1985) introduced this function as an approximation to numerical results of Horii and Nemat-Nasser (1983) for the dependence of the stress intensity factors for a row of colinear cracks. More generally, the function g (a) describes the decrease of local tensile stress with distance away from the inhomogeneity and the increase due to crack interaction. The first effect causes initially stable growth and the second is the source of a peak in the stress strain curve. Different forms of this function may be needed to describe data on different rock types. A few other forms have been explored by Rudnicki (1994).

AB  - Abstract As technology advances in horizontal well drilling, long horizontals completion are now preferred for producers aiming to explore more oil-bearing zones, especially in heavy or tight oil reservoirs. However, for strong waterdrive horizontal wells, abrupt increase of water-oil ratio and abounding unwanted water production severely affect the profitability of the field due to the constant decrease of oil production and premature well shutting. The targeted reservoir of this work is a typical heavy oil reservoir with strong waterdrive. By December 2014, the average water cut for the two productive layers has increased 40-70%, for some wells especially, the water cut has exceeded 95% causing frequent well shutin. Therefore, to ensure the productivity of the horizontal wells, water shutoff has become a challenging and urgent task. According to the aquifer identification and water influx diagnosis, 27 horizontal wells distributed in aforementioned two productive layers were first categorized into two groups in order of treatment difficulties, after which foam-assisted gel and gel treatments were designed and conducted. For the three of the treated wells, the average water cut was significantly reduced from 80.3% to 48.0%. Although the gross liquid production rates were slightly reduced after treatment from 31.7 to 27.7 t/d, the oil production rate was considerably increased by 28.1 t/d. By January 2016, 4 500 t of the incremental oil was produced indicating the success of the water shutoff jobs. However, it should be noticed that the water cut of the N2 foam-assisted gel treated well started to rapidly rise after two months. This is probably caused by inappropriate foam/gel volume ratio. The water control strategies and field results in this heavy reservoir will provide the necessary clues for the design and application of water shutoff treatments for horizontal wells driven by strong water.

AB  - 1 Introduction Modelling the relationships between rainfall, hydrology and deep-seated landslides on a real-time basis and with sufficient response time constitutes a key challenge of early warning and decision support systems. We show here our findings on an autonomous, real-time modelling of slope kinematics at Veslemannen slope (SW Norway), aiming to determine slope-response to precipitation by considering time-dependent aspects of slope behavior. Answering this question will not only increase our understanding of the slope, but also help on the hazard management prior to a potential collapse. Rock Slope Failures (RSF) around the world generally display creep strain curves characterized by episodic acceleration and deceleration phases in a so-called stick-slip pattern (Prior & Stephens 1972). A sudden increase in pore water pressure and increasing stresses in the landslide body is normally observed after each rainfall episode, revealing a fast infiltration through preferential paths (Corominas et al. 2005; Loew et al. 2012; Blikra et al. 2013; Crosta et al. 2014). This behaviour is normally followed by a progressive decay in velocity reflecting a gradual reduction of water pressure, possibly due to flow diffusion (Iverson 2000). When the movement enters into tertiary creep phase, strain rate is normally characterized by a continuous acceleration until sudden catastrophic failure (Petley et al. 2005; Rose & Hungr 2007; Agliardi et al. 2010). Degrading permafrost also controls the timing and location of RSF (Krautblatter et al. 2013). Model parametrization in RSF forecasting is normally intricate due to inherently complex geological, hydrological and geomechanical conditions. In addition, epistemic uncertainties also appear due to progressive and/or abrupt changes of slope behaviour in a time-dependent manner (Eberhardt et al. 2004; Petley et al. 2005; Abellan et al. 2015). Calculating slope acceleration and deceleration phases as response to rainfall using inverse modeling and empirically-derived response functions has proven useful before (Belle et al. 2014; Abellan et al. 2015; Bernardie et al. 2015).

AB  - Abstract Providing an overview of an ensemble of oil reservoir models could help users compare and analyze their characteristics. Approaches that show a single model at a time may hamper analysts’ understanding of the whole model set. In this paper, we propose two visualization approaches that show multiple reservoir models, simultaneously and on a single screen, with the goal of helping users to compare models and improve their understanding of ensemble characteristics. First, we calculate 2D models from the ensemble's 3D models. We then create two visualizations that represent ensembles of these 2D models. The Small Multiples approach lays out heatmaps of 2D models side-by-side on a grid. Pixelization approach shows n 2D models in a single heatmap, where each cell (i, j) contains n subcells that represent values in the coordinate (i, j) of each model. Both approaches display their elements (heatmaps and subcells) clustered by X-means, which may help analysts identify similarities and representative models in the ensemble. We used two types of distance matrices: based on Euclidean distance of models for a given property or, based on Euclidean distance of feature vectors of the 2D models. We tested our approaches within models based on Brazilian benchmark cases corresponding to a turbiditic reservoir (UNISIM-I-D/M/H) and a presalt carbonatic reservoir (UNISIM-II-D). As a result, the Small Multiples approach presented clusters of similar models for some properties of the ensembles we studied, e.g. eight clusters of porosity values in UNISIM-II-D's ensemble. This fact suggests that eight representative models can represent the ensemble, regarding porosity. Also, a Pixelization approach revealed patterns that happen in specific regions of all models of an ensemble, such as an abrupt change of porosity values in the northwest region of UNISIM-I-M's models. Both approaches have the potential to help analysts perceive situations that would be improbable to observe in a graph with only mean values for each cell. Therefore, our proposal can be helpful to users who need to deal with uncertainties and have an overview of ensembles of models for better understanding and decisionmaking, e.g. when they need to choose representative models for a process of decision analysis related to petroleum field development and management.

AB  - Abstract The synergetic effect of salinity and fluorochemicals on the alteration of wettability from water-wetting to intermediate gas-wetting is studied in this work. We find that NaCl salinity increases water-wetting when a core is saturated with brine. NaCl also reduces absolute gas permeability as reported in the literature. CaCl2 salinity is drastically different from NaCl brine, and has a minor effect on permeability. The NaCl, KCl and CaCl2 brines have an adverse effect on wettability alteration. To alleviate the effect of salt on treatment, we suggest pre-treatment by displacement of brine with water and subsequent drainage by nitrogen. Introduction A reduction in effective gas permeability observed in tight formations and in low permeability gas reservoirs is often attributed to water blocking and condensate accumulation. The water blocking is induced by the injection of water in hydraulic fracturing (Engineer, 1985; Cimolai, et al. 1993). The condensate accumulates at the wellbore as the pressure drops below the dew-point pressure (Barnum et al. 1995; El-Banbi et al. 2000). A major factor of liquid retention in a rock is the liquid's low mobility due to strong liquid wetting (Anderson, 1987a, b). By altering the wettability of the rock from liquid-wetting to intermediate gas-wetting, an increase in liquid mobility can be achieved resulting in a high rate of gas production. In 2000, Li and Firoozabadi pioneered the alteration of wettability by fluorochemical treatment, and demonstrated significant changes in contact angle, and imbibition testing for cores after treatment. Following their work, there have been a number of experimental studies on wettability alteration to intermediate gas-wetting (Tang and Firoozabadi, 2002, 2003; Kumar et al. 2006; Fahes and Firoozabadi, 2007; Panga et al. 2007; Al-Anazi, et al. 2007). Most of the work on wettability alteration has been performed by injection of chemicals into a core initially saturated with air or nitrogen, i.e., the dry core. In some cases the rock has been saturated with water or oils. The reservoir rock before the chemical treatment is partially saturated with liquid condensate and the aqueous phase that may be connate water, condensed water from the gas, or from the aquifer. There is always a definite amount of ions in the subsurface water. For example, condensed water from gas may have 140-150 mg/l of chloride ion, and the fracturing fluid water may have ~ 25 mg/l chloride ion. One of the main parameters in wettability and imbibition studies is the water composition that can affect the wettability. Based on spontaneous imbibition and waterflooding tests at reservoir temperature in Berea sandstone with three crude oils and three reservoir brines, Tang and Morrow (1997) found that the salinity of the connate water and invading brines can have a major influence on wettability and oil recovery. Zhang and Austad (2006) verified that the ions Ca2+ and SO42- could increase the water-wetting of chalk, and thereby increase the water-oil capillary pressure of matrix blocks. There is an abrupt change in the zeta potential when only small amounts of ions are added to the aqueous solution. Tweheyo et al. (2006) have studied the effect of divalent ions on wettability alteration of carbonates and the subsequent effect on oil recovery by spontaneous imbibition. They found that SO42-, Ca2+ and Mg2+ ions can change the wettability to more water wetting at 100ºC and above without surfactants in the system. The three divalent ions seem to play different effects in the two processes: wettability alteration and spontaneous imbibition.

AB  - AbstractBlock 3 reservoirs in Angola are dolomitic reservoirs with temperatures ranging from 150 to 164°C with a nearly constant pressure (320 bar). They are all affected by scale precipitation that forms into the tubings and the topsides.Modeling was applied to find quick correlations between physical measurements and the predicted risk of scaling. Information from wire line reports, maintenance operations and gamma campaigns were gathered in order to draw up a list of risky wells, and to validate the found correlations. The water cut, the composition of the produced water, the well head temperature and the drawdown can be used to determine the risk of scaling and roughly the location of the deposits. In this paper, on one hand, we present the relation between drawdown, water cut and Calcium carbonate precipitation and on the other hand between salinity and barium sulphate scaling.The kinetic module of the SCALE2000 software was used to explain why the injected seawater does not produce any Calcium carbonate inside the tubing even if it is supersaturated at surface conditions. Finally, a new version of this software has been tested; it includes a model that uses simplified hydrodynamic approach based on a scheme of chemical reactors connected in series. The model thus takes into account the cumulated effects of water flow in terms of Pressure and Temperature variations, and changes in dynamic water composition due to the mixing. It is then possible to estimate both the thickness of the scale deposits and their location along a production or injection well.IntroductionBlock 3 in Angola is a whole of mature fields almost all affected by scale precipitation that forms into the tubings and the topsides, mainly Calcium carbonate but also a few barium sulphates. That scaling sometimes occurring even with the use of scale inhibitors, hence, it was decided to proceed to an audit of in place scale management in order to improve the prevention. Quantitative prediction of scaling is more difficult to assess and requires to take into account the feedback between complex processes such as multiphase flow with varying water-oil-gas ratios and kinetic water-rock interactions. That is, to our best knowledge, beyond the capacities of the available numerical models due, in particular, to remaining theoretical uncertainties on the detailed transport mechanisms. Correlations were found between the results of basic modeling and scaling pointing out a list of criteria that may give a quick and accurate tendency of the risk of scaling. A methodology of scaling diagnosis of oil production wells was developed. In a first step, the saturation index of typical sulphate and carbonate scaling minerals was evaluated for all brines. In a second step, the production parameters (BSW, drawdown, well head conditions and salinity) were analyzed with regard to the modeling. In a third step, the thickness of scales all along the tubing and the precipitated masses were used as guidelines. Finally the variation with space and time of scales distribution in PAC302B well was estimated with the new version of SCALE2000 (V3.0). The precipitation rate law with kinetic parameters1,2 has been used in the present study.Scale Prediction Risk StudyThe potential mass of deposits depends strongly on the volume of produced water; thus it is the first criteria to consider in a scale prediction risk study.Even if a few deposits were observed at very low water cut, based on our field experience, we have assumed that it should be at least higher than 30% to get a significant mass of deposits.Calcium carbonateThe chemistry of Calcium carbonate deposition is now clearly understood in the Block 3 production wells. At the Bottom Hole, the water is in equilibrium with the rock and the gas of the reservoir (CO2 / HCO3 equilibrium).Calcium carbonateThe chemistry of Calcium carbonate deposition is now clearly understood in the Block 3 production wells.

INTRODUCTIONThe hydroelectric scheme of Torrão,located on the river Tamega, a tributary of the Douro,. is one.of the most important hydroelec tric developments under construction in Portugal for the last years. The first controlled filling of the reservoir has taken place this very year.A 69 m high gravity dam and an underground power plant, where two reversible-type 79MW peak load units are installed in two twin shafts, are the most important features of this scheme. The 60 m high shafts with a 17 m diameter cross section each are excavated in the left bank of the river, very close to the granitic slope of the Tamega valley, about 150 m away from the dam (Figure 1). The hydraulic circuit is composed ,besides the water intake and outlet, by a 12 m x x 9 m elliotical gate shaft and two inde - pendent tunnels of 6,70 m diameter, about 200 meters long.The paper records the monitoring plan carried out to control the excavation effects and to ensure the long-term stability of the underground structures of Torrão hy droelectric scheme. An investigation of the rock mass properties as well as the more significant results about the structural behaviour of the underground openings and slope stability in the neighbourhood of the power station, are reported.2 .GUIDELINES OF'THE MONITORING PLAN FOR THE UNDERGROUND STRUCTURES The monitoring plan of the underground openings was included in a more general do cument about the surveying of the Torrão hydroelectric scheme (LNEC, 1985) .The plan was conceived bearing in mind the specific conditions of the different structures com posing the underground complex and namely, the location of the two-shaft power plant, very close to the abrupt slope of the granitic left bank of the river.With such olan it was intended to record an amount of significant data, to make it possible the appraisal of the punctual and general safety, either during construction or during initial and continuing exploitation. It was also intended to make the best use of such data during construction, in order to optimize the construction tech niques and the final design. So, priority was given to the determination of parameters which, in a simple and direct way, would express the structural behaviour and allow, by their greatness and time evolution, the interpretation of such behaviour.

AB  - SummaryA myriad of imaging challenges exist in the shallow subsurface, many of which are discarded in the exploration industry as part of the weathered zone. The fact that extreme variability exists in the near surface is not new. It has been recognized by previous researchers that even small changes in layer thicknesses and/or velocities within the unsaturated layer, as well as large velocity gradients, can significantly affect high-frequency shallow seismic reflection data in the form of statics, increased source-generated noise, lower dominant frequencies, and uninterpretable or nonexistent reflections. The example presented here highlights some of the extreme changes in near-surface properties, including: a 2:1 lateral velocity gradient, a 3:1 vertical velocity gradient (both of which occur as abrupt velocity discontinuities), and a thin low-velocity layer overlying part of the line that leads to masked reflections and severe degradation of the stacked section. What is unique is that such large changes occur within a roughly 15 m wide by 4 m deep cross section—a testament to just how quickly near-surface properties can change across very short distances and their potentially significant impact on shallow seismic reflection data. IntroductionThere are numerous potential issues to contend with during processing of seismic reflection data, some of which include topography, multiples, statics problems caused by the “weathered” layer, and source generated noise. While many of these issues are common to both exploration-scale and shallow seismic reflection data, near-surface variability is one of the biggest challenges for shallow applications and is beginning to be recognized in the oil and gas industry as a hurdle to overcome. Changes in seismic velocity can occur rapidly over short distances, producing large velocity gradients both vertically and laterally. Lateral variations in velocity may occur as a result of faulting, fluvial deposition (sand bars, clay lenses, gravels, etc.), or glacial processes, to name a few. Two common scenarios where large vertical velocity gradients are likely to be observed include a shallow water table within unconsolidated sediments and unconsolidated materials overlying bedrock. The interface between unsaturated and fully saturated materials can exhibit contrasting P-wave velocities ranging from as low as 200– 300 m/s to 1600 m/s or more in the span of one or two seismic wavelengths (Birkelo et al., 1987; Sloan et al., 2007). The velocity contrast between dry unconsolidated overburden and bedrock has been shown to vary by as much as 800% (Miller et al., 1989; Goforth and Hayward, 1992).

AB  - In-situ combustion (ISC) is being carried out in the Quifa heavy oil reservoir in Colombia, employing four vertical inner wells and four deviated outer wells (inverted nine-spot pattern). Additionally there are four horizontal wells surrounding the pattern, which started producing one year before the combustion project was initiated.  In order to evaluate the project performance key parameters, such as volumetric sweep efficiency and recovery factor must be estimated. Therefore, it is important to have reliable values of drainage area and oil in-place volumes since they are basics for the calculations. Given the complex nature of this reservoir, with a strong water drive, the estimation of the drainage area, oil in place and the recovery factor posed a major challenge. The reservoir is characterized by abrupt permeability and oil saturation changes, resulting in water channeling and well interference. This paper presents the methodology used to obtain the drainage area and current recovery factor of the ISC pilot project by using numerical reservoir simulation. It comprises the generation of oil drainage maps and cross-plots of what we called “Oil Displaced by Neighboring Wells, ODNW” as a function of time. This approach is more accurate than analytical methods for such complex reservoirs since those methods are based on ideal homogeneous reservoir conditions that assume uniform fluid displacement and a symmetrical advance of the combustion front. Results are presented for the oil in place, the drainage area, and the recovery factor at one year of air injection.  These results are compared with those derived from analytical methods.  The methodology was designed to be readily applicable to similar heavy oil reservoirs worldwide.

AB  - Summary The effects of gravity, viscous forces, interfacial tension, and wettability on the critical condensate saturation and relative permeability of gas condensate systems are studied using a phenomenological simple network model. The results from the simple model show that wettability significantly affects both critical condensate saturation and relative permeability. Relative permeability at some saturations may increase significantly as the contact angle is altered from 0° (strongly liquid-wet) to 85° (intermediately gas-wet). The results suggest that gas well deliverability in condensate reservoirs can be enhanced by wettability alteration near the wellbore.IntroductionMuch attention has been paid to the study of in-situ liquid formation and fluid flow mechanisms in gas condensate systems in recent years. When gas condensate reservoirs are developed by pressure depletion, gas well deliverability is affected by the amount and the distribution of the condensate formed around the wellbore. Understanding of the parameters that affect the distribution and the amount of condensate saturation Sc in the wellbore and the effect of these parameters on gas and liquid flow are important in the development of the methods for increased gas deliverability.There are numerous field examples of gas condensate reservoirs that experience a sharp drop in gas well deliverability at high pressures due to condensation near the wellbore.1-3 There are examples that show that the condensation may even kill gas production.2 The sharp reduction in gas deliverability may be due to the shape of the gas phase relative permeability (krg); the mechanisms of gas productivity impairment are not yet clear. Two main parameters affect condensate recovery and gas well deliverability. These two parameters are critical condensate saturation (Scc which affects liquid recovery) and gas phase relative permeability (krg which affects well deliverability).Various authors4-9 have measured Scc and a wide range of observations has been reported. The measured values of Scc are generally in the range of 10 to 50%. Gravier et al.4 measured Scc in low-permeability carbonate cores with permeability in the range of 0.5 to 40 md and interfacial tension (?) variations from 0.5 to 1.5 dyn/cm. Scc varied from 24.5 to 50.5% with an average of 35.0%. These measurements were conducted in the presence of connate water. Morel et al.9 reported a critical condensate saturation of less than 1% for ?=0.05 dyn/cm and connate water saturation of 20%. The critical condensate saturation was measured in a vertical dolomite core. The measured Scc is apparently related to various effects including gravity and interfacial tension.Some authors have accounted for the effect of gravity by conducting flow experiments both in horizontal and vertical directions. Danesh et al.10 studied the effect of gravity on Scc in water-wet micromodels and sandstone cores. They found that Scc in a vertical core was lower than that in a horizontal core; their tests showed that gravity reduced the critical condensate saturation. These authors also examined the dependence of critical condensate saturation on ?. As expected, Scc increases with an increase in ?. Ali et al.11 observed an improved condensate recovery of 17.2% in a vertical gas injection compared with that in a horizontal injection. Their experiments were conducted with a high interfacial tension for gas condensates (?=0.92 dyn/cm). Sandstone cores and a synthetic six-component fluid were used by these authors. When ? was decreased to 0.04 dyn/cm, condensate recovery improved to 27.5% with vertical injection. Henderson et al.12 also reported a significant reduction of the critical condensate saturation in long vertical core samples in comparison with those in horizontal cores. Munkerud,6 however, did not find a significant difference in condensate recovery and saturation between horizontal and vertical pressure depletion. He used Berea cores and a synthetic six-component fluid.A number of authors have studied gas phase relative permeability (krg ) of gas condensate systems. Gravier et al.4 found an abrupt decrease in krg at saturation close to Scc Chen et al.5 measured krg at reservoir pressures with reservoir rock and reservoir fluids from two North Sea gas condensate reservoirs (reservoirs A and B). The interfacial tension ? varied from 0.01 to 0.42 dyn/cm. The results showed that krg reduced about 10-fold due to condensation when Sc reached 20% for the core and fluid from reservoir A. Reduction of krg with the increase of Sc for the core and fluid from reservoir B is less pronounced but an abrupt decrease of krg at the saturation close to Scc was also observed. Chen et al.5 showed that krg is rate dependent; it increases with the increase of the flow rate. Henderson et al.13 measured gas condensate relative permeabilities using a long Berea core and a five-component synthetic gas condensate fluid; ? varied from 0.05 to 0.40 dyn/cm. They found that the relative permeabilities of both gas and liquid phases decreased with the increase of ? and increased with the increase of the flow rate. Gas relative permeability was more sensitive to ? and flow rate than liquid relative permeability. The results from the work of Munkerud6 and of Haniff and Ali14 differ from the other authors. They did not observe the abrupt decrease of krg.The brief review above points out that there are many unresolved issues in the study of critical condensate saturation and gas condensate relative permeability. The sharp decrease in gas relative permeability at saturation close to Scc that was observed experimentally has not yet been studied theoretically. The dependence of Scc, krg, and krc on interfacial tension, viscous force, and gravity are not clear from the experimental data. The question remains how to measure Scc, krg, and krc in the laboratory and how to scale them to field conditions. The conclusions drawn from the experimental results are sometimes not consistent. A theoretical understanding of the effect of ?, gravity, viscous force, and wettability on Scc, krg, and krc provides insight into the recovery of liquid condensate from rich gas condensate reservoirs, and gas well deliverability from both rich and lean gas condensate reservoirs.

AB  - GEOLOGICAL ASPECTS OF ABNORMAL RESERVOIR PRESSURES IN THE GULF COAST REGION OF LOUISIANA, U.S.A. BY GEORGE DICKINSON S ynop'sis High pressure zones frequently make drilling of wells most difficult in a belt about 50 miles wide along the coastal plain northwest of the Gulf of Mexico from the Rio Grande to the Mississippi Delta. This study is an attempt to link geological factors with occurrences of abnormal pressure in order to provide a better understanding of their origin. Abnormal pressure has been defined as any pres- sure which exceeds the hydrostatic pressure of a column of water containing 80,000 parts per million total solids. Dangerously abnormal pressures occur commonly in isolated porous reservoir beds in thick shale sec- tions developed below the main sand series. Their locations are controlled by the regional facies change in the Gulf Coast Tertiary province, and they appear to be independent of depth and geolog- ical age of the formation. The high pressures are caused by compaction of the shales under the weight of the overburden which is equivalent to approximately one pound per square inch per foot depth. Difference in density between gas and water causes abnormal pressure when hydrocarbon accumulations occur above wa- ter, irrespective of whether the water is at normal or abnormal pressures. The magnitude of this press- ure depends upon the structural elevation above the source of pressure in the water and may cause very high pressure gradients in isolated sand bodies. However, the trend of pressures in the Gulf Coast region indicates that maximum pressures will prob- ably not exceed ninety per cent of the overburden pressure. * Regional Production Department, Shell Oil Company, Houston, Texas. The abrupt increase in pressure above normal hydrostatic pressure often occurs over a very short vertical interval which makes control difficult.

AB  - Liquid-rich shale (LRS) wells have shown abrupt changes in production rates and fluid composition. In order to maintain high liquid hydrocarbon production rates over the life of well, as well as proper reserve estimation, a better understanding of the in-situ reservoir fluids is required. In this work, an investigation is performed on the areal and vertical geospatial fluid property variations across the Barnett and Eagle Ford. Available Barnett PVT data was adjudged as entirely nonrepresentative and a multi-contact recombination procedure has been implemented to improve estimates of in-situ reservoir composition. Eagle Ford is known to be highly under-saturated and with no concerns about representativeness identified through data validation, these were accepted and utilized without modification. Ternary diagrams indicating fluid type, vertical variations of OGR, C7+ and API gravity were investigated. Maps were created to review areal variations of these properties (API gravity, C7+, and initial OGR), and finally the decline of OGR with time was studied. Our study used publicly available data to confirm compositional variation across the Barnett and Eagle Ford. Regions were defined based on initial producing OGR and the decline of this property with time. The created maps present not only ranges and trends for OGR, API gravity and well stream C7+ parameters but the methodologies can be applied to assessing other fields.

AB  - ABSTRACT:The deformation of brittle rock is studied using a mechanical model that is developed based on the analyses of the microscopic fracture processes within rock. The simulations demonstrate that the elastic parameters (E and v) for the rock matrix and for the fractured specimen can be measured during the unloading and reloading cycle; the axial splitting failure brings about more abrupt bursts than the shear faulting failure; and the size of specimen affects the post-peak behaviour. RESUME:La defonnation des roches fragiles est etudiee à l'aide d'un modèle mecanique qui est base sur l'analyse du processus de microfracture à l'interieur de la roche. Les simulations demontrent que les paramètres d'elasticitè (E et v) de la matrice de la roche et de l'echantillon fracture peuvent être mesures durant le cycle de decharge-recharge; la rupture axiale provoque plus d'explosions brutales que la rupture en cisaillement; et la taille de l'echantillon affecte le comportement post-pic. ZUSAMMENFASSUNG:Die Deformation von Spödgestein wurde untersucht anhand eines mechanischen Modells, das auf den Analysen von mikroskopischen Bruchvorgangen im Gestein basiert. Die Simulationen zeigen, daβ die elastischen Parameter (E und v) der Gesteinsmatrix und der gebrochenen Proben wahrend des Austragtaktes und der Frischladungsaufnahme gemessen werden können; das Versagen durch axiale Risse bewirkt ein abrupteres Bersten als das Versagen durch Scherbruch; und die Gröβe der Proben beeinfluβt das Post-Peak-Verhalten. 1 INTRODUCTIONIn underground excavations, it is often observed that a great number of parallel cracks appear in mine pillars and walls (Coates, 1981). Obviously, the cracks are induced under compression. Sometimes, pillars fail completely due to axial splitting, but most of the time pillars fail in a combination of spalling and shear faulting. In this case, axial cracks are initiated and grow to some extent within a pillar under compression. Then, spalling occurs in the middle of the pillar and develops towards the centre. At the final stage, pillars fail due to the shear faulting along the conjugate planes crossing the centre of the pillar or due to crushing. Horii and Nemat-Nasser (1985, 1986) conducted a series of experiments using resin specimens containing a single flaw or a large number of flaws that were different in length to examine the fracture pattern of the specimens under compression. For the specimen containing a single flaw, wing cracks were initiated at the tips of the flaw under compression. Then, they tended to grow in the loading direction. For specimens containing a large number of flaws, it was reported" that they failed in the form of either axial splitting under uniaxial compression or shear faulting under biaxial compression. Wing cracks were first initiated at the tips of those large flaws and grew in the direction of the maximum compressive stress. The wing cracks continued to grow with an increase in the uniaxial compressive stress. Finally, they coalesced and formed axial splitting fractures through the specimen. However, the fracture pattern was different when confining pressure existed. Wing cracks were first initiated at the tips of large flaws, but their growth was soon suppressed by the confining pressure. Wing cracks were then initiated on a large number of small flaws and coalesced to form shear faults. It is concluded, based on the observations in the field and the laboratory experimental results, that axial splitting is the basic local fracture pattern for brittle rocks under compression. In the pre-peak stage, axial splitting predominates the fracture process, while in the post-peak stage shear faulting does. A constitutive model has been developed for brittle rocks based on the analyses of the fracture process within rock. The deformation of rock, in this model, is decomposed into four components which are caused by (i) the elastic response of rock matrix, (ii) the closure of open cracks, (iii) the growth of cracks, and (iv) the shear faulting, respectively. In the pre-peak stage only the first three are considered, but all four components are involved in the post peak stage.

AB  - Abstract Gas- or liquid-driven pig trains are sometimes used during pipeline dewatering before the line is commissioned for gas transport. Pig trains consist of compartments of drying liquid separated by sealed mechanical pigs. Gels may be used in the front and the rear of the train for various purposes, such as minimizing gas bypass, providing seal lubrication, etc.Train operation is controlled by modulating the supply gas pressure and controlling the water discharge with a valve opening at the downstream end of the line, The valve opening schedule determines the pig train's rate of acceleration. A very fast opening schedule results in high hydraulic transient pressures that may cause rapid velocity changes. An opening schedule that is too slow would cause "start-stop" or "jerky" pig movement, which could result in forward gas bypass. Both of these effects tend to degrade train performance.To help estimate the characteristics of a pig train for a given operating schedule, a numerical simulator has been developed. This simulator incorporates mathematical models of the pigs, the fluid compartments, the pipeline geometry, and the downstream control valve. The fluid compartments and the liquid portion of the pipeline are modeled with the method of characteristics while taking into account the non-Newtonian character of the gel rheology. Coulomb friction along with stiction is used to model the pigs.The simulator has been used to design dewatering train startup and shutdown schedules for two methanol swabbing operations involving two subsea Zeepipe pipeline systems: one 814 km (505 mi.) long and the other 250 km (155 mi.) long. These trains have consisted of several pigs with methanol and gel compartments. Unscheduled abrupt shutdowns have also been simulated. The methods developed can be applied to the general case in which pigs are used for fluid separation.The performance of the two actual pipelines illustrates the significance of the new approach relative to the startup and shutdown of pig trains in general.This paper describes the dynamic mechanisms involved in pig trains and abolishes certain intuitively developed paradigms, such as starting a train "very slowly" to minimize the hydraulic transients.Introduction Pipelines are normally hydrotested for mechanical integrity either after a repair job or after the initial installation. After hydrotest have been performed, a line is dewatered and dried before it can be commissioned for gas transport.1,2A dewatering system involves a displacement fluid supply, a dewatering train, and a valve for water flow rate control (Fig. 1). The dewatering train takes up different configurations depending upon the size of the pipeline. In pipelines shorter than 50 km (30 mi.), a small number of mechanical (foam or wiper seal) pigs can be driven with nitrogen or air, Sometimes produced gas is used to displace the train.

AB  - ABSTRACT:In this paper, the sloshing effect on the roll motion of a two-dimensional rectangular box in regular waves is studied experimentally and numerically. First, we carry out experiments for a rectangular model with different filling ratios in a 2D flume. The roll motion is measured by a video camera, which can trace two different marks on the model very accurately. The steady-state roll motion is filtered out by a post process. It is found experimentally that the roll response shows a peak at the roll natural frequency and an abrupt change but with a small magnitude at the lowest sloshing natural frequency. The multi-modal method is applied to describe the free surface in the box and the resulting sloshing moment is estimated numerically. The roll motion of the model is calculated by using an in-house code based on the linear potential theory. It is found that the leading-order solution over predicts the roll motion at the sloshing natural frequencies compared to the experimental data. The next-order method gives an improved solution at the second sloshing natural frequency, but still over predicts at the lowest sloshing natural frequency.INTRODUCTIONAs clean energy has become an important global issue in the 21st century, the demand for natural gas has largely increased. In accordance with such a trend, natural gas starts to be exploited and explored even in deep waters, which implies the development of new production systems like LNG-FPSO. Meanwhile it is nowadays not easy to construct new LNG receiving terminals on land near shore, hence the new concept of LNG receiving terminals like LNG-FSRU is proposed and designed. In both cases of LNG-FPSO and LNG-FSRU, the structure is of floating type and it in general undergoes 6DOF motions under the action of incoming waves.

AB  - Abstract Most sand production prediction models to date have the capability to indicate whether initial sand production may take place during the lifetime of a reservoir but they are unable to predict whether the sand production will be ‘problematic' (excessive erosion, plugging, well sand-up, separator fill, etc.), particularly for systems that have some tolerance towards sand production. In order to predict whether sand production will be ‘problematic', it is important to estimate sand volumes / rates as a function of bottom-hole load conditions, drawdown, time, etc. This paper presents a model to predict  sand volumes / rates for any type of clastic oil or gas reservoir. This model captures both the geomechanical aspects (rock deformation and failure) and the transport aspects (e.g. role of drawdown and watercut) of the sand production problem. It was extensively validated comparing predicted sand volumes and rates with field observations for a variety of oil and gas fields under various stages of depletion. For all these cases, the model predictions and field observations are in reasonable to good agreement. The main focus of the current paper is the discussion of bean-up procedures, i.e. the question is addressed as to whether an appropriate bean-up strategy (e.g. small bean-up steps) may reduce the cumulative volume of produced sand. We show that for wells without sand control, the cumulative amount of sand produced to surface is independent of bean-up procedure. If a large sand production volume is expected in such a well, beaning it up in small steps not only increases the risk of sand-up in itself, but also the risk of repeated sand-ups before the well can finally be produced. By contrast, for wells with sand control, the risk of plugging by fines mobilization is reduced by beaning up in small steps. 1.   Introduction Conventionally, sand production prediction models have the capability to indicate whether initial sand production may take place somewehere during the lifetime of an oil or gas field 1-6. However, these models are unable to predict whether the sand production will be ‘problematic' (e.g. in terms of erosion, plugging, well sand-up, separator fill, etc.), in particular for systems that have some tolerance towards sand production. In order to predict whether sand production will be ‘problematic', one needs to be able to estimate sand volumes and rates as a function of, amongst others, bottom-hole load conditions, drawdown, and time. In recent years, a number of sand rate prediction models have been published in the literature 7-14. However, owing to the scarcity of "dedicated?? sand production field data (for example, Sand Influx tests), the apparent inconsistency that is often exhibited by production-related field data, and the fact that laboratory sand production experiments to date were mostly done on relatively small samples, there is still a wide variety in the understanding of the fundamental physical processes underlying sand production. Previous sand failure prediction research has shown that the primary role of fluid flow (drawdown) in sand production is the transport of loose sand (debris) resulting from compressive rock failure, rather than failure of the intact sandstone itself (see, for example, refs. 5,15). This has led to the general consensus that sand failure is a necessary, but not sufficient condition for sand production. However, once the sand has failed, what are the exact circumstances that lead to its production? And what are the mechanisms by which the sand cavity re-stabilizes after initial failure? It is here that the opinions start to diverge. In Refs. 7-11, sand production is directly coupled to an increase in porosity around the wellbore (perforation) as a result of volumetric plastic strain. Post failure stabilization (PFS) of the cavity after initial failure is assumed to result from local permeability increase as a result of sand production. This permeability increase in turn reduces the flow-induced drag forces on the sand grains, and therefore reduces sand production. In Refs. 7-9, sand production is directly coupled to the volumetric plastic strain, whereas in 10,11 it is coupled to the product of plastic strain and fluid flow via a semi-empirical "erosion criterion??. None of these models addresses the impact of watercut on sand production.

AB  - ABSTRACTWithin the current activities of the Operational Oceanography department of NCMR, three wave models operate for the area of the Aegean Sea. In order to develop an efficient forecasting structure and apart from the traditional model-to-measurement comparison, a preliminary modelto- model comparison in the examined area is also performed: mean annual results concerning model hindcasts are presented and a Geographical Relative-Deviation Function (GRDF) is produced. This function can be used as a guideline for further research in the areas of "model high uncertainty" by operating wave buoys in those areas. INTRODUCTIONBackground information on the Aegean Sea The Aegean Sea is located in the Eastern Mediterranean, between the coasts of Greece and Turkey, being the third major sea of the Eastern Mediterranean, larger and deeper than the Adriatic but smaller in volume than the Levantine. The very irregular coastline, the complicated bottom topography, the presence of a large number of islands scattered over the area and the abrupt changes in magnitude and direction of the time varying wind fields constitute the distinguishing features of the Aegean. The topographic and bathymetric features of the Aegean are depicted in Figure 1. The Aegean Sea is the "link" between the fresh Black Sea and the salty Eastern Mediterranean. To the northeast, the Black Sea waters enter the Aegean through the Dardanelles straits. To the south, the Aegean is connected to the Eastern Mediterranean through several passages along the Cretan arc: the straits of Rhodes, Karpathos and Kassos in the southeast and of Kithira in the southwest. On the average, the dominant winds over the Aegean blow from the north. Second in frequency appear the southern winds, whereas the eastern and western winds have much lower frequencies of occurrence. During winter, strong, cold and dry northerlies prevail.

AB  - Summary We have studied the electrical transport properties of porous media and the physical meaning of Archie's parameters with 2D lattice gas automata (LGA). On the basis of our simulations, we have developed a set of new equations to calculate fluid saturation from electrical measurements. The calculations from the new equations show very good agreement with laboratory measurements and published data on sandstone samples. There are limitations for this study in applying mesoscale modeling to the resistivity-index/ water-saturation (I/Sw) relationship for porous rocks because only 2D models of sandstone rock were simulated. Some important factors like wettability were not modeled. However, current flow simulations on the 3D digital rock samples of various types reconstructed from thin sections and high-resolution CT scans of real rocks have been ongoing in our laboratory as the next step to address these issues. Introduction Archie's (1942) equations (F = aF-m and I = bSw-n, where a, b, m, and n are constants and called Archie parameters) have been the fundamental equations used to calculate fluid saturation of porous rocks from electrical well logs. There have long been questions and arguments about the true physical meaning of the Archie parameters because the micropore structure, the flow of fluid, and the electrical current in a porous medium cannot be directly observed and controlled in laboratory measurements. In oilfield electrical-logging-data interpretation, non-Archie behavior of the porous rocks (i.e., the I/Sw relationship not being linear on a log-log scale) has been increasingly observed and reported by log analysts and petroleum engineers (Diederix 1982). Diederix (1982), Li (1989), Worthington and Pallatt (1992), and Jing et al. (1993), among others, have studied this so-called "non-Archie phenomenon?? of porous rocks extensively. The non-Archie phenomenon generally becomes more evident as the water saturation decreases further. However, because of the limitations of macroscale laboratory experiments, it is not possible to quantify the factors that influence the I/Sw relation. Many researchers have tried to simulate the behavior numerically at the pore scale. Schopper (1966) used a resistor network to study the formation factor/porosity relationship. Yale (1984) developed a 3D pore-network model to simulate the transport properties of porous rocks. Tao et al. (1995) used Yale's model to interpret electrical-conductivity and elastic-wave data simultaneously measured on fluid-saturated sandstone samples. Man and Jing (2001) further developed Yale's model to account for the electrical transport properties of multiphase-fluid-saturated porous media. Jonas et al. (2000) used a statistical network to study the physical basis of Archie's first equation. However, because these models do not simulate closely enough the real pore structures and fluid distributions, the theoretical modeling has achieved only limited success.

AB  - Abstract China has seen its natural gas consumption rise significantly over recent years. As a result, unconventional energy, specifically shale gas, has become a focused alternative. However, major challenges to develop efficient shale gas extraction, such as the geology, undulating terrain, lack of water resources, immature expertise prevail. Thus, large scale commercial production of shale gas remains in its infancy. The Sichuan basin is a testament of this where exploration and production of unconventional reservoirs have taken place since the 1950s. With the basin resting in a major compressional tectonic area, part of the shale gas reservoirs is fractured, sensitive to abrupt structural dip changes and faulted standoffs. This complicates reservoir stimulation with unpredictable fracture orientations and growth. Lateral property changes within the reservoir and varying stratigraphic thickness adds to this shortcoming. To shorten the learning curve, successful and established workflows from US plays such as the Eagle Ford, Marcellus and Barnett were introduced. From these plays, it was established that different shale plays retains distinct differences that were addressed through customization in the process and workflows. The differences were identified through detailed evaluations of reservoir quality(RQ) and completion quality(CQ). However, to address the local challenges during well construction, a new focus is needed with the introduction of drilling quality (DQ). In this aspect, PetroChina South West Oil and Gas Company (SWOGC) operating in one of the Sichuan shale plays adopted the above workflow to accumulate and analyze the data with the objective to establish the main drivers for reservoir production towards recovery enhancement. Consequently, the customization of process and workflows to support large scale commercial shale gas development in the Sichuan Basin can be achieved.

AB  - AbstractIt is well known that wellbore storage and phase redistribution have a direct influence over well testing data, mainly on those recorded at early times of the test. After this early time period, such influence disappears, and the pressure response is dominated by the reservoir and the skin zone properties. However, sometimes the effects of wellbore dynamics last long enough as to completely disguise the reservoir response.The above situation frequently constrains the use of some analysis procedures such as type curve matching, especially if the test did not last long enough as to reach radial flow conditions. In this way, some tests are uninterpretable because of the duration of these wellbore effects.Using as a basis two classical models related to well test affected by changing wellbore storage, this work introduces a new method of analysis for these tests with insufficient duration to reach radial flow conditions. The use of the methodology proposed in this work is illustrated with synthetic examples and a field case.For some synthetic cases the type curve matching procedure may yield completely erroneous values of the parameters, while with the suggested method reasonable estimates are obtained.IntroductionWellbore storage is recognized as a phenomenom that affects the recorded pressure behavior at early times during a well test. Sometimes, the phenomena related to mass balance and fluid momentum that occur inside the wellbore, constrain the application of some analysis procedures, especially if the test does not show transient radial flow conditions, and can even disguise completely the pressure response.Phase redistribution occurs when a producing well (that contains more than one phase) is closed at the surface, and due to gravitational forces these phases segregate from each other, this causes a distorsion on early time data of the test. In 1981, Fair introduced a model which takes into account the phase redistribution phenomenom in the diffusivity equation solution as applied to buildup analysis. He assumed an exponential increase in wellbore storage.More recently, Hegeman et. al., proposed an extension to Fair's model, obtaining a general solution in Laplace space, which allows to add the changing wellbore storage effect for a variety of analytical well-reservoir models. These authors considered two models of changing wellbore storage, the exponential function and the error function. For the error function, the transition period is more abrupt than with the exponential function.In 1992, Fair presented another study on the influence of a wide range of wellbore phenomena including mass-balance and momentum phenomena. Also, in that work wellbore phenomena such as fluid temperature changes (represented by an exponential function as in the case of wellbore storage), phase changes inside the production tubing and inertial effects were considered.Currently, the only available method to estimate the reservoir permeability and skin factor from insufficient transient data (tests affected by changing wellbore storage and that have not reached radial flow period) is the type-curve matching technique. To apply this procedure it is necessary to identify the function (exponential or error function) that fits best the storage effect. Nevertheless, the absence of data in the infinite acting period difficults the matching procedure, resulting in a match with high uncertainty.With the purpose of modeling in a more rigorous way the reservoir-wellbore system, it is necessary an algorithm that couples the mechanistic behavior of the well with that of the reservoir, such as that of Hasan and Kabir, Winterfeld propose the use of a completely numerical scheme that simulates the transient conditions of the system.

AB  - This paper was prepared for the Abnormal Subsurface Pressure Symposium of the Society of Petroleum Engineers of AIME, to be held in Baton Route, La., May 15-16, 1972. Permission to copy is restricted to an abstract of not more than 300 words. Illustrations may not be copied. The abstract should contain conspicuous acknowledgment of where and by whom the paper is presented. Publication elsewhere after publication in the JOURNAL OF PETROLEUM TECHNOLOGY or the SOCIETY OF PETROLEUM ENGINEERS JOURNAL is usually granted upon requested to the Editor of the appropriate journal, provided agreement to give proper credit is made. Discussion of this paper is invited. Three copies of any discussion should be sent to the Society of Petroleum Engineers Office. Such discussions may be presented at the above meeting and, with the paper, may be considered for publication in one of the two SPE magazines. Abstract An apparent relationship of the environment of deposition to the occurrence of abnormal high-fluid pressures in a sand-shale sequence of the subsurface South Texas Oligocene is established. The abnormal high pressures are generally encountered in the "downdip" facies, which consists of deltaic sediments of alternating inner neritic (includes brackish and nearshore marine) and middle neritic (shallow marine) depositional environments. There is an abrupt change in the environment of deposition that seems to coincide with the top of the abnormal high-pressure zone. This new approach to predicting abnormal high-pressured formations can be used at the well site. The key to a better understanding of the problems and the solution to these problems associated with abnormal high-fluid pressures may be found in an understanding of the depositional environments and history of the sedimentary basin. In order to accomplish this, there may be a need for more workers to examine surface and subsurface rock samples. Introduction Many workers have presented conclusions on abnormal high-fluid pressures encountered in boreholes throughout the world. Probably the Gulf Coast region of the U.S. is better known because of the numerous boreholes and the documentation available. Many giant hydrocarbon accumulations are produced from normal pressured reservoirs, and probably the majority of fields are in this classification. However, giant accumulations have been discovered in abnormal high-pressured formations also. Some questions that will be reviewed in this report are the following. 1. Why is it that abnormal high pressures are encountered by the drill bit in some bore-holes and not in others when drilled to the depth in the same region? 2. Are there any attributes of depositional conditions that are always associated with this phenomenon? 3. How can we better predict the occurrence of abnormal high pressures within a petroleum basin?

AB  - AbstractFoam has been successfully used in many areas of the petroleum industry. Since the application of foam was first proposed for the process of gas phase injection, most studies were made with respect to the properties of bulk foam. Although it seems to be unreasonable to expect flow of bulk foam through porous medium, very few papers have reported on the relative permeabilities or fluid distributions in the presence of foaming agent, especially in consolidated sand.Relative permeabilities of foaming agent solution-nitrogen gas were measured by both steady and unsteady state methods using fired Berea sandstones. These were compared with the reference relative permeability of brine-nitrogen gas. The permeability reduction factor was calculated from the ratio of the gas permeability in the presence of foaming agent to that in the absence of foaming agent. The effects of surfactant concentration and pressure gradient were investigated. This permeability reduction factor is mainly a function of lamellae stability. Although these permeabilities might more appropriately be called pseudo relative permeabilities, particularly in the case of gas phase, they do give some ideas about flow mechanism.The results show a significant difference between steady and unsteady state flows. Unsteady state experiments show a small change of relative permeability to gas over a wide range of saturations and exhibit no complete blocking effect. In steady state, however, the simultaneous flow of liquid and gas could be stabilized only above a minimum gas saturation of about 35-40% probably due to the formation of a large number of foam lamellae by the continuous supply of foaming solution.Pressures as a function of distance were measured at three pressure taps spaced at equal distances along the core. The pressure profile shows abrupt jumps in the pressure with advancement of the gas phase due to the capillary pressure. After gas breakthrough, the pressures at each tap were stabilized. The results during the steady state flow showed that the pressure drop between taps increases with the increasing distance from the inlet end of the core sample, which indicates that the higher gas fraction results in a greater blocking effect.The effluent concentrations of surfactant were measured by a UV spectrophotometer to calculate the adsorption isotherm of this foaming agent. The dynamic adsorption of Suntech IV showed a Langmuir type isotherm. The adsorption was less than 2 moles/gm of sand up to 1.0% of concentration.IntroductionIn any type of gas phase injection for enhanced oil recovery such as immiscible or miscible gas injection, CO2 flooding and steam drive, it is inevitable to encounter gravity override due to the density difference, gas fingering caused by an unfavorable mobility ratio, and high gas flow through thief zones.In 1958, Bond and Holbrook patented a gas drive process in the presence of surfactant having foam-producing characteristics to improve the sweep efficiency. Since then, the mechanism of foam flow through porous media in gas flooding has been studied extensively. Recently, application of foam was extended to steam drive and CO2 flooding.P. 351^

AB  - Abstract Using a BEM-based hydraulic fracture model and the Coulomb frictional law, the generation of slip and shear rupturing produced by fluid injection is investigated. A wide range of factors can contribute to injection-induced seismicity. In addition to injection rate, fluid viscosity and existing permeability, several other factors are considered in this paper to determine their effects on slip development during continuous fluid injection and during shut-in. These factors include dilatant strengthening, slip weakening of frictional coefficients, structural complexities along a rupturing path like jogs and branches and the application of far-field wave-form stresses. The numerical method is summarized and the theoretical formulation of the above physical processes associated with generation of seismic events is provided. The numerical results show a rich and complex local slip rate change during extension of the slip zone. Under fluid injection, the slip can first produce a seismic event either caused by rapidly increasing pressure or by abrupt slip initiation, and then slows. When the permeability is large enough, the slip pattern manifests itself as long-term slow slip period coupled with aseismic slip transients. The long-duration and low-magnitude seismic events are associated with the slipping state in the conditionally stable regime, in which fluid pressure is marginally equal to a value required to produce slip using the effective stress and the static frictional strength. A small perturbation in the fluid pressure caused by any of the above factors can stop and/or generate relatively faster slip rates. The slip continues varying with time after shut-in in the presence of the above influencing factors. The slow slip on a fault, which is difficult to detect by seismology, could be a significant process in dissipating elastic strain energy during hydraulic fracturing stimulations. In addition, the model can capture a tendency of the slip rate to become significantly large. The results demonstrate the importance of fracture and fault permeability enhancement on variations of fluid pressure and slip rates.

AB  - Abstract Information about pressure variations is contained in and may be extracted from an analysis of the velocity of shales in an overpressured environment. This analysis is performed routinely on well logs where the shale points can be easily identified. Variations on the analysis are also commonly applied to seismic data and, in the best case, a reasonable approximation of shale velocities can be calculated and used to estimate shale pore pressures. Because of the centroid effect, sand pore pressures cannot be assumed to be equal to the pressure of the encasing shales. This effect becomes strong in overpressured areas with any appreciable dip and continuity of the sands. The result may be an abrupt increase in pressure when a sand bed is encountered at a relatively high structural position; or, conversely the pressure may abruptly drop if the sand is encounted further downdip.

AB  - ABSTRACT: Rockfalls constitute an abrupt type of landslide process with manifold impact at local level, on economy and mostly on a human modified environment. Rapid automated and accurate mapping of rockfalls’ characteristics are crucial in order to identify areas of potential risk and propose mitigation measures. Simultaneously, urban expansion in hazardous regions in combination with climate change variations had played an important role on the increase of rockfall events. The current study presents a novel semi-automated approach to detect rockfall hazard from detailed 3D point clouds that were collected with an Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV), right after a recent rockfall event, triggered by heavy rainfall that destroyed several houses in the base of a steep terrain. Block geometry measurements of sliding slope have been provided in relation with the geometrical and mechanical characteristics of the main discontinuity surfaces from the photogrammetric 3D point cloud. In addition, this study was contributed by field measurements and laboratory tests of the rock joint strength for the analysis of the slope stability of the rock blocks. A set of corresponding discontinuity factors have been detected and characterized in terms of point cloud analysis and provide a qualitative hazard system to assess rockfall probability by extensive characterization and parametrization of the joint systems. Results have demonstrated the capabilities of combining UAV platforms with computer-based methods for rapid and accurate identification of discontinuity parameters subjectively and even from inaccessible areas of the rockfall body. 1. INTRODUCTION Rockfalls present a substantial increase in their spatial and temporal distribution over the last decade especially in developed societies with severe impact on infrastructure and livehood. The latter has a direct link with the tremendous increase of population in urban areas where built-up zones extended in landslide and rockfall prone areas (Glade, Anderson, & Crozier, 2005). Geo-information techniques and remote sensing have played a vital role in the interpretation and understanding of landslide and rockfall kinematics.

AB  - IntroductionOil production is normally accompanied by a concomitant production of large amounts of water. The separation of produced water and its purification prior to discarding, represent an important technological challenge for the oil production industry. For instance a well producing, 20,000 m3/day of oil with a BSW (Basal Sediments and Water) of 50% and a TOG (Total Oil and Grease) of 300 mg/L would produce 3 tons of oil and grease per day. In order to minimize environmental impacts, these residues must be reduced to acceptable levels; this being particularly important in offshore operations where the most obvious destination of the produced waters are the oceans.The oil contained in produced oily waters often is in the form of very stable emulsions. For these systems oil/water separation by the usual physical procedures is difficult; in particular in offshore operations, where space, production facilities and residence times are limited. The use of chemicals as flocculants or flotation agents is common practice in these cases. The products generally recommended are cationic polyelectrolytes however; the field use of these polymers is limited due to the formation of solid residues that in the form of oily sludge accumulate in the treatment plant facilities reducing, after some time, the efficiency of the equipments. In this contribution, other polymers like poly(ethylene oxide) (PEO) or poly(vinyl alcohol) (PVA), that present a good performance as flocculating agents1 for other systems and fictionalized PVA containing hydrophobic alkyl chains and/or carbamate groups are assayed for oil-water separation. Furthermore some studies to identify the causes of sludge formation are also presented.Experimental PartMaterials. The nonionic polymers used in this work were commercial samples kindly supplied by the manufacturers and were used without further purification. PVA1 is a poly(vinyl alcohol) (PVA) presenting a molecular weight of around 72,000, (Vetec, Qu mica Fina Ltd. Rio de Janeiro, Brazil). PVA2 and PVA3 are products manufactured by Air Products and Chemicals. Inc. (Allentown, PA. USA), commercialized as Airvol 165 and 540 respectively. Both polymers present molecular weights between 140,000 and 180,000 but PVA2 is 100% hydrolyzed and PVA3 has a hydrolysis degree between 87 and 89%. Ucarfloc 302, 304 and 309 are water-soluble poly(ethylene oxide), (PEO), polymers, presenting molecular weights of 5, 7 and 8 × 106, respectively, produced by Union Carbide (Union Carbide Corporation, Denbury, CT, USA).Two PVA samples presenting molecular weights of 72,000 (PVA1) and 140,000 (PVA2) were chemically modified by fuctionalization with carbamate groups and hydrophobic alkyl chains. The incorporation of carbamate groups (urethanes) in the structure of PVA was made by reaction of urea with PVA in the ratio of 1:1, using dimethylformamide as solvent2. The reaction temperature was fixed at 145°C and the time varied from 30 to 180 minutes. The esterification was carried out subsequently, following Schotten-Baumann reaction3 using acyl chlorides with hydrocarbon chain length varying from 12 to 18 carbon atoms. The temperature was fixed at 145°C and the reaction time was 2 hr. The solvent was also dimethylformamide for this reaction.

AB  - ABSTRACTThe authors state that knowledge of the static distribution of interstitial water in oil and gas sands is of great importance in making volumetric estimates of reserves and in the solution of dynamic-flow problems. Following a brief discussion of the theory involved, the authors present two methods for estimating the static distribution of interstitial water in oil and gas sands by laboratory tests of core samples-one involving the application of gas pressure, and the other utilizing centrifugal force. The authors state that a comparison of these test results with water content obtained by distillation of oil-drilled cores indicates that the irreducible water saturation, as determined in the laboratory by the gas-pressure method, is not far removed from the water saturation of reservoir sands above the transition zone, and that the more rapid centrifugal method may have equal value, but that additional experimental work is required on this method.INTRODUCTIONKnowledge of the static distribution of interstitial water in oil and gas sands is of great importance in making volumetric estimates of reserves, in the solution of dynamic-flow problems particularly, when used in conjunction with relative permeability data,1a in evaluating results of core analyses and related subjects. Unfortunately there is little published information covering methods for determining the interstitial water content of oil and gas sands by laboratory examinations of core samples. Data obtained by coring with oil-base drilling fluids or with tracers in waterbase muds2 are limited, and the reliability of results is open to some question. This paper presents two methods for estimating the static distribution of interstitial water in oil and gas sands by laboratory tests of core samples. One involves the application of gas pressure, and the other utilizes centrifugal force. Discussion of TheoryIn a reservoir the transition from the water zone to the oil zone or from the oil zone to the gas zone is often not abrupt but gradual, the thickness of a zone of transition depending upon pertinent properties of the system. Also in that portion of the oil zone lying above the water-oil transition region the per cent of water saturation comes to a nearly constant value, substantially independent of height. This value has been labeled by Hassler, Brunner, and Deahl3 as the \"irreducible water saturation,\" and will herein be referred to as such. The surface chemistry of the capillary pressure-fluid saturation relationship has been discussed in detail by M. C. Leverett.4 However, a brief treatment here would seem to be in order. At any point in a porous body where fluid phases co-exist at equilibrium, two opposing forces-hydrostatic head and capillary pressure-are balanced against each other. The capillary pressure, i.e., the pressure deficiency on the convex side of a curved interface, may be defined as follows: (mathematical equation available in full paper) where: Pc is the capillary pressure, V is the boundary tension, r1 and r2 are the principal radii of curvature of the curved interface, and C is an arbitrary quantity called the mean curvature. When Pc is balanced against an opposing hydrostatic head, the following equation applies:(mathematical equation available in full paper)

AB  - AbstractThis paper is based on a collection of studies, partly published partlyunpublished, where the performance of multilateral wells is assessed from theviewpoint of reservoir drainage. The underlying studies range from case studyof multilateral wells with production history, to feasibility studies ofmultilateral wells (in land, platform, and subsea fields), to generic studiesby numerical methods and optimization techniques on reservoir drainageefficiency of multilateral wells. This paper will not reproduce a full accountof those studies, rather it will highlight the key lessons latent in thosestudies which may serve as useful guiding principles for those contemplating orplanning use of such wells. Specifically, the paper addresses how multilateralwells fare against the more conventional or traditional horizontal wells. Thekey concepts are summarized in four ‘lessons' pertaining to high-drawdown,low-drawdown, multi-reservoir, and injection applications. Brief mention ismade also of aspects other than reservoir drainage (or injection) efficiencythat can influence the choice of well architecture.IntroductionFor the purposes of this presentation, we recognize two types ofapplications. Same-reservoir applications refer to the case where the wellpenetrates a region with a relatively uniform pressure distribution.Multi-reservoir applications refer to the case where the well penetratesgeologically noncontiguous bodies, or penetrates a region with abrupt ornoticeable pressure variations.In same-reservoir applications we recognize two types. High-drawdown refersto the case where the pressure drop in the formation exceeds the pressure dropin the wellbore. This is generally believed to be the case in tight formationsor formations saturated with viscous crude (heavy oil). Low-drawdown refers tothe case where the pressure drop in the formation is of the same order ofmagnitude (or is inferior to) the pressure drop in the wellbore. This isgenerally believed to be the case in multi-Darcy or unconsolidatedformations.

AB  - ABSTRACT Performance test provides important information about whether a newly constructed pipeline can achieve the design capacity and transportation efficiency. The field performance test also provides mechanical performance correction factors for compressors as part of the commissioning procedure of natural gas transmission pipelines. The EPC contractors are usually asked to ensure that the pipeline can achieve the delivery pressures and flow rates under the protocols agreed upon. Pipelines are normally designed to achieve certain flow rates in different phases. However, it is not uncommon to see pipelines falling short on gas supply or user demand during the time period that the performance test is scheduled for. The available pipeline inlet pressure and flow rate are lower than the guarantee conditions described in the performance test protocols. The quality of the gas supply may also create unexpected problems on the interpretation and evaluation of the performance test results. Therefore, it is necessary to conduct the performance test at lower pressures and lower flow rate conditions. This paper presents the methodology, strategy, procedure as well as a real life example of a simulation based performance test of a gas pipeline. The method presented offers a practical tool to validate pipeline performance by evaluating the fundamental physical parameters. This method can also be used in assessing the pipeline hydraulics conditions for potential corrosion issues (ID change), roughness changes, BSW deposition or other issues influencing pressure drops in the pipeline. INTRODUCTION AND BACKGROUND Performance test is an important part of the commissioning procedure of natural gas transmission pipelines after their construction. The EPC contractors are responsible of ensuring the pipeline can achieve the delivery pressures and flow rates under the protocols agreed upon. Pipelines are normally designed to achieve certain flow rates in different phases. However, it is not uncommon to see pipelines falling short on gas supply during the time in which the performance test is scheduled. During the economic down turns, the pipeline users may also have difficulty accepting the gas at the flow rate required to achieve the pipeline guarantees. In these circumstances, the available pipeline inlet pressure and pipeline flow rate are lower than the guarantee conditions described in the performance test protocols. The quality of the gas supply may also create unexpected problems in the interpretation and evaluation of the performance test such as the presence of black powder. Therefore, it is necessary to conduct the performance test at lower than anticipated pressures and flow rate conditions. The question is how to assess whether the pipeline performance will achieve the guarantees with the data collected at a lower pressure and lower flow conditions? The answer lays in the assessment of the pipeline parameters using measurement data at lower pressures and flow rates, along with gas pipeline hydraulic simulations at guarantee conditions. This paper presents the methodology, strategy, procedure as well as a real life example of a simulation based performance test of a gas pipeline.

AB  - ABSTRACTIrreversible deformation in brittle rocks is accompanied by acoustic emissions. In sequential loading series with increasing load one can estimate the previously applied maximum load by using the so-called Kaiser effect: An abrupt rise of acoustic emissions can be observed, as soon as the applied load exceeds the former maximum load. So far there is only little knowledge about in which way a prestress in a different direction than the applied load affects the occurrence of the Kaiser effect. An experimental campaign was carried out with granite parallelepiped specimens to win valuable clues about the influence of an axis rotation on the acoustic emissions and the rock mass properties. For this purpose we compared the acoustic emissions of specimens with and without a perpendicular preload. The results of the tests indicate that neither the rock strength nor the acoustic emissions are influenced by a preloading orthogonal to the reloading direction. The results are in accordance with those of other researchers (e.g. Stuart et al., Lavrov et al.) stating that no Kaiser effect can be detected in specimens uniaxially and sequentially loaded in orthogonal directions. Other interesting results on the acoustic emissions were achieved at low stress levels, which can be explained by some crack propagation theories.INTRODUCTIONDesign and operation of underground excavations require accurate information about in-situ stresses. As an alternative to conventional stress measurement techniques, the acoustic emission technique in combination with the Kaiser effect is being explored since the past decades. This method is based on the ability of brittle material to accumulate, retain and reproduce II1formation about the stresses experienced in the past, the so-called "stress-memory".Explanations for these phenomena can be made with known crack propagation theories.Acoustic Emission-techniqueThe Acoustic Emission technique is a non-destructive method allowing the detection and the monitoring or the micro-structural changes in an object. Under the action of compressive stresses or tension brittle rocks progressively accumulate damage as micro-cracks nucleate, grow and coalesce. The AE-technique relies on the fact that cracks usually form dynamically, emitting packets of high frequency elastic energy that Can be detected by using the appropriate (piezoelectric) transducer (Cox, 1991).The Kaiser effectThe so-called Kaiser Effect can be observed in brittle materials, such as rocks. If a rock sample is loaded (Fig. I), (σ1), acoustic emissions (AE) can be detected (I). If the sample is unloaded and then reloaded, no(Figure in full paper)Crack growthThe Kaiser effect can be well explained with the growth and propagation of cracks in the material. It is well known that small microcracks exist in brittle materials. At a certain stress level ali the weaker elements in the structure begin to fail and wings cracks emerge at the tips of existing cracks (Fig. 2(a) and (b)). If the sample is then unloaded, the cracks remain in the rock mass (Fig. 2(c).During a reloading, no new cracks will be created until the former stress level σ10 the weak elements have already failed. is reached, because

AB  - SUMMARY:The characteristics of deformation of elastic sedimentary rocks are closely related to the porosity which is reduced during the process of geological compaction. Various kinds of Tertiary sedimentary rocks in Japan have been deformed experimentally under confining pressures. Porous sedimentary rocks show the transition from brittle behavior to ductile behavior at low confining pressures. The critical pressure for transition from normal ductile behavior to visco-ductile behavior is related to the effective pressure which the rock suffered during geological compaction. Natural and artificial over-pressure may cause flow-like deformation of soft sedimentary rocks. RESUME:Les caracteristiques de la deformation des roches sedimentaires clastiques sont en relation avec la porosite qui se diminue dans le processus de la compaction geologique. Des diverses roches sedimentaires tertiaires au Japon ont ete deformees en experimentations triaxiales. Les roches sedimentaires poreuses font la transition de la condition fragile à la deformation ductile à la basse pression laterale. La pression critique pour la transition de la condition ductile normale à la condition visco-ductile est en relation avec la pression efficace que la roche a souffert dans Ie processus de la compaction geologique. La surpression naturelle et artificielle peut causer la deformation fluide des roches sedimentaires tendres. ZUSAMMENFASSUNG:Die Verformungseigenshaften dersedimentaren Truemmergesteine bezieht sich auf die Porositat, die sich unter dem geologischen Verdichtungsprozess vermindern. Die Verformung der verschiedenen Arten von tertiaren Sedimentgesteinen wurde unter triaxialem Druck untersucht. Poröse Sedimentgesteine zeigen die Umwandlung vom fragilen bis zurndehnbaren Verhalten unter niedrigem Seitendruck. Der kritische Druck fuer die Umwandlung vom normalen dehnbaren bis zum viskodehnbaren Verhalten bezieht sich auf den wirksamen Druck, den die Gesteine wahrend der gelogischen Verdichtung erfahren haben. Es wird angenornrnen,dass durch natuerlicher und kuenstlicher Überdruck die fluessigen Verformung der weichen Sedimentgesteine verursacht wird. 1. INTRODUCTIONA great variety of mechanical properties of elastic sedimentary rocks multiply the difficulty of estimation of mechanical stability of rock mass. Often, it is impossible to test every variety of rocks which participate in deformation. During the process of compaction, sedimentary rocks continuously transform from unconsolidated sediments into hard rocks. The overburden pressure and tectonic stress gradually reduce the porosity of sedimentary rocks. One of the authors reported the relation between porosity and strength of clastic sedimentary rocks(Hoshino, 1974). The chemical composition, mineral assembly and texture of rocks also change during the process of compaction. In case of porous sedimentary rocks, the porosity is the most important factor which indicates the degree of compaction and which controls the characteristics of deformation. In this paper, characteristics of deformation of sedimentary rocks under confining pressure are discussed in terms of geological compaction. The apparatus and method of experiments have been described in Hoshino et al.(L972). 2. POROSITY EFFECTThe porosity of rock is gradually reduced by compaction. The older rock is generally less porous than younger rocks under similar sedimentary and tectonic environments. 3. BRITTLE-DUCTILE TRANSITIONThe behavior of deformation of rocks is classified based on the stress-strain relation as in Fig. 3. The brittle behavior shows abrupt fracturing with no or very slight inelastic deformation. The ductile behavior is characterized by large inelastic deformation over the yield point without fracturing. Rocks often show work hardening at the ductile condition. The transitional behavior shows inelastic deformation but is accompanied with partial stress drop by faulting. The behavior of deformation of rock is transformed from brittle failure through transitional mode into ductile flow with the increase of confining pressure. Soft sedimentary rocks are transformed into ductile state at very low pressure. However, the transition of behavior of soft rocks follows similar simple law as the one for hard rocks which was found by Mogi(1966) and Byerlee (1968). The fields of brittle failure and of transitional and ductile deformation are divided by a boundary line (R) in the confining pressure-strength diagram(Fig.4). 4. Visco-ductile flowA phase of extremely ductile flow has been found by deformation experiments of soft sedimentary rocks under confining pressures(Koide et al., 1971, Hoshino et al., 1972). This flow phase was temporarily named as visco-ductile behavior. The visco-ductile behavior is characterized by a monotonical gentle slope of stress-strain curve(E in the Fig. 3). Test data of core samples indicate that the critical confining pressure for transition into visco-ductile flow becomes higher with increase of sampled depth. The critical pressure is almost appropriate to the overburden pressure(Fig.6). The transition into visco-ductile flow is a kind of thixotropic weakening. A structural framework of porous sedimentary rock is broken by higher confining pressure than the effective precompaction pressure. Porous sedimentary rocks are liquefied by high effective confining pressure. The transition into visco-ductile flow from normal ductile deformation occurs along the boundary line(S) in the Fig.4. The equivalent viscosity after the definition by Griggs(1939) is very low for porous sedimentary rocks(Fig.7). The low equivalent viscosity indicates the viscous liquid-like behavior of porous sedimentary rocks.

AB  - Abstract The previous generation of integrated reservoir models for KOC's heavy oil fields in North Kuwait brought insight which enable implementation of development decisions. With field maturation, additional well data and emerging production trends drive a need to update models to ensure relevance for serving the evolving business objectives of sustaining and maximizing incremental production. This subsurface analysis has been augmented through study of the Jal-Az-Zor escarpment (north of Kuwait City) where stratigraphic equivalents of the reservoir crop out. Field analogues permit direct observations of the reservoir characteristics and heterogeneities that influence production behavior and ultimately project economics. They can resolve questions on spatial continuity of the key reservoir flow units by bridging the scale gap between seismic and well data which directly link to OPEX & CAPEX expenditure through optimal well spacing & design, injection steam/water conformance and BSW management. It is relatively rare to have available such closely linked field-outcrop analogue data which is so readily accessible. The Jal-Az-Zor Escarpment represents an important cost-effective resource which is only just beginning to be leveraged in an integrated way to benefit field development and operations. Applications for the field observation data set include but are not restricted to: Lateral and vertical continuity/variability of the reservoir, baffle and barrier lithologies. Role of diagenesis and its control on reservoir quality. Recognition of thin but critical units that need to be retained in the model e.g. high (or low) perm streaks. Appreciation of Microscopic to Field scale heterogeneities compared with well spacing. Field to Core/Log calibration to improve interpretation Multidisciplinary engagement

AB  - SummaryPremature drillpipe failure is a serious drilling problem. Such failures normally occur in internal-upset (ill) and internal, external-upset (lEU) drillpipe in the internal taper (Miu) or near where the ill blends into the drillpipe tube ID. This paper illustrates some of these types of failures and offers a new long-taper, thick-wall upset as a solution.IntroductionSome American Petroleum Inst. (API) standard-upset drillpipes sustains rapid fatigue damage because of the abrupt transition from the ill back to the drillpipe tube ID, which is a point of high-stress concentration that attracts corrosion. The problem is amplified further by poor application of the internal plastic coating that usually is associated with this condition and because our drilling environment is becoming more corrosive, with increases in brine water, H2S, and CO2.The long-taper upset drillpipe discussed here will help solve this problem by spreading the stress over a larger area and by better application of coating in the Miu area.Typical Drillpipe Fatigue Failures. Gensmer reported 18 premature failures in one drillpipe string during the first 2,800 rotating hours in an area where normal life expectancy was 18,000 hours. He observed that Miu taper lengths were shorter among the failed joints; more than 70% were < 1-in. long and several ranged from only ¼ to ½ in. He sampled many other premature failures from several other strings and found similar results. Most joints had Miu taper lengths of 1 in. or less.Gensmer also reported that he had received failure reports from two other users with similar problems: one user had 24 failures in the first 500 rotating hours on one string, and another averaged two failures per day on 12 drillpipe strings in use.Because of what was thought to be an inordinate increase in drillstring failures, the API and Intl. Assoc. of Drilling Contractors (IADC) formed a committee to study the problem. The committee issued a final report in Sept. 1990. Unfortunately, the committee drew no conclusions on the possible effect of the IU runout, but it reaffirmed that typical failures predominantly are near the upset runout.

AB  - AbstractGeological material can be subjected to some different loading conditions, mainly due to three inter-related physical processes which are mechanical, thermal, and hydrological. Freezing and thawing process of rock that occurs in sub-zero temperature condition may contain some or all those three physical processes depended on its initial condition. Those inter-related physical processes may lead the ground into failures. Therefore, understanding the physical properties such as deformation process of geological material under freezing and thawing condition is required for the artificial ground freezing projects and engineering construction activity in the natural cold region.In order to study the strain characteristic of rocks during freezing and thawing process, a series of freezing and thawing experiments of core samples of three different rock types and mortar has been conducted under varying temperature from -20 °C to +20 °C. Four core sample types are Sandstone, Granite, Tuff, and Mortar with 50 mm diameter and 50 mm height, which were naturally dried before the freezing-thawing experiment. Freezing-thawing experiment was conducted by submerging the vinyl covered core samples into a temperature-controlled liquid coolant box. Firstly, temperature of liquid (brine solution) was set at -20 °C so that the temperature of subjected sample was decreasing to as low as -20 °C. And then the temperature of brine was returning to initial room temperature after the coolant system was stopped. Strain gauge and thermo couple were attached on the core’s perimeter to measure strains and temperature changes. Sandstone and Mortar samples show relatively similar results than other two samples. Both presents linearly shrink with the temperature decrease and expand almost to its initial condition with the temperature increase. Granite shows less-linear strain-temperature relationship during thawing process, while the Tuff sample shows abrupt strain increase during thawing process on the temperature higher than +10 °C. Thermal expansion value of each rock types were obtained by fitting the major strain-temperature relationship on -19 °C to +10 °C temperature range. Overall, anisotropic deformation was observed on the entire samples and possible mechanisms for each hysteresis characteristic are discussed, which need to be confirmed by further experiments.

AB  - Abstract Several multiphase models exist for predicting pressure drops in vertical, inclined and horizontal wells. Most of these models made efforts to unravel the underlying physics of multiphase fluid flow for both mechanistic and analytical models with ranges of applicability. However, these developed models have their specific limitations or ranges of applicability in terms of pressures, rates, basic sediments and water (BSW), choke sizes, fluid ratios, etc thus there is no one model that is universally acclaimed best. Data from fifteen (15) wells were obtained from a Nigeria field and multivariate linear regression was fitted into the data resulting in a good fit particularly for high production rates/wells. The method of least squares was adopted which involve setting up a set of normal equations, solving them by Gaussian elimination technique and fitting the data into the normal equations. The solution of the primary matrix was obtained through the use of MATLAB software which gave point estimates of the regression parameters leading to the development of multivariate linear regression model. The Bootstrapping method of statistical inference was also used to estimate the confidence interval of these regression parameters, while the Durbin-Watson test statistic was used to test model adequacy. The results of the model compared favourably with existing models within considered range of applicability. This paper therefore aims to address the challenges of field based multiphase fluid flow model for operational ease using a set of over one thousand production data sets of about forty (40) years of production taken from a renowned field in the Niger Delta. More specifically, our investigations show that taking the infimum (i.e. lower bound) of the parametric bandwidths of the gas rate, average bean size and the model correction factor, b0 the model predictive capability is drastically improved for low to medium rates.

AB  - Abstract A theory describing the mechanism of triaxial behavior of rocks in underground formations is developed for the purpose of analyzing underground stress conditions. A phenomenon of an abrupt transition from elastic to plastic states of rocks under triaxial compression is anticipated from the theory, which is verified by laboratory experiments simulating conditions in underground formations. Based on the theory and experimental results, a method for determination of the underground stress field is proposed, and the existence of the plastic state and the boundary of transition in underground formations are predicted. Introduction There are essentially two basic assumptions required for stress analysis of any underground structure. The first one is to assume the state of the static stress field in the formation, and the second is to assume the existence of a plastic state of stress as distinguished from an elastic state. Usually, a crude assumption is made that the formation is either elastic or hydrostatic without clear understanding of the stress condition. 4 Also, the existence of the plastic state has not been generally accepted. Thus, most of the mathematical and experimental analysis of stress in underground structures is based on rather uncertain knowledge. The underground structures referred to here are tunnels, cavities, drill holes and any other created openings. As demonstrated by many investigators, rocks in general exhibit a plastic nature in varying degrees with increase of triaxial compression. This phenomenon can be explained by solid state mechanics since molecular (or ionic) displacement in solids takes place whenever the shearing stress exceeds a definite limit of the intermolecular attraction. From studies of the mechanism of triaxial behavior of rocks, a theory of transition from elastic to plastic states of rocks is introduced here for the purpose of replacing these two crude assumptions. Theoretical determination of both the static stress field and the existence of the plastic state is made.

AB  - AbstractDeconvolution of pressure and flow rate measurements is one of the great challenges inherent in well test interpretation. Deconvolution allows the test analyst to estimate the constant-rate transient pressure response of a reservoir-well system, and assists us in system identification and parameter estimation. Unfortunately, deconvolution amplifies the noise contained in data. Often we cannot identify the reservoir system from deconvolved results owing to solution instability caused by noise in measured data. We previously presented1 a deconvolution technique based on the fast Fourier transform that we applied to a single buildup or drawdown period. Unlike other deconvolution methods that deconvolve pressure and rate data in the time domain, our method deconvolves pressure and rate data in the frequency domain. We found that we can remove the noise transferred to deconvolved pressures in the frequency domain, and we can find a stable and interpretable deconvolution solution even when test data are noisy. In this paper, we extend our previous work and apply the deconvolution technique based on the fast Fourier transform to arbitrarily changing rate profiles such as multi-rate tests. The deconvolution results, which represent a constant-rate pressure drawdown response spanning the entire duration of the test, can provide helpful insight into the correct reservoir description. We have improved our original deconvolution method in number of ways, particularly with the introduction of an iterative algorithm that produces stable deconvolution results. We demonstrate application of our deconvolution method to analysis of synthetic and field examples, including both flow and shut-in periods. Our deconvolution method can efficiently reproduce the characteristic responses of the reservoir-well system and increase our confidence in parameter estimates. IntroductionDeconvolution is a technique used to convert measured pressure and rate date into an equivalent constant-rate pressure response of the reservoir. The constant-rate pressure response is essential information in well-test analysis since it is commonly used to characterize the type of reservoir-well system, flow regimes and boundary features with well-test diagnostic plots. Successful deconvolution techniques could bring significant benefits to well-test analysis. It can significantly improve our ability to interpret tests by increasing the interpretable range of measured data and the radius of investigation into the reservoir. With deconvolution solutions, conventional well-test analysis methods can be extended to interpret various types of pressure-rate measurement data, such as single flow period (drawdown/buildup) tests, multi-rate tests, and permanent downhole gauge pressure and production tests. When applied to pressure transient testing of a single flow period, deconvolution removes the wellbore storage effects in measured pressures so that the early-time behavior of a reservoir-well system hidden by wellbore storage can be unveiled. As a result, the interpretable range of measured data is extended. The recovered early-time pressure response can be used to improve our confidence in reservoir system identification and reservoir parameter estimation. In a previous paper, [1] we presented a fast-Fourier-transform (FFT)-based deconvolution technique to deal with pressure transient test data during a specific drawdown/buildup period corresponding to an abrupt change in surface flow rate. This technique can successfully deconvolve "noisy" measured data from drawdown/ buildup tests dominated by wellbore storage (including variable wellbore storage coefficient), and can restore constant-rate pressure responses. Our new method is extremely helpful for analyzing pressure transient testing data in cases where reservoir behavior is completely masked by wellbore storage effects at early times. In these cases, we could easily identify the reservoir system incorrectly and use the incorrect part of the diagnostic plot for parameter estimation, without removing wellbore storage.

AB  - Distinguished Author Series articles are general, descriptive representations that summarize the state of the art in an area of technology by describing recent developments for readers who are not specialists in the topics discussed. Written by individuals recognized as experts in the area, these articles provide key references to more definitive work and present specific details only to illustrate the technology. Purpose: to inform the general readership of recent advances in various areas of petroleum engineering. Abstract The state of the art of three hydrate applications in petroleum engineering is presented in order of decreasing importance: (1) flow assurance, (2) energy resource, and (3) climate change. In flow assurance, there is a hydrate-plug-prevention shift under way: from avoidance to management of hydrate formation. In addition to avoiding the region of hydrate stability by injecting thermodynamic inhibitors, time-dependent studies enable flow-assurance engineers to better address such concerns as flowline restarts, cold (stabilized) flow, low-dosage hydrate inhibitors, and plug remediation. These applications are related to conceptual ideas of hydrate-plug formation in oil and condensate systems. The second area, energy resources, is marked by a transition to an extended production test in the permafrost, and to characterizing resources and economics in the marine environment. The third area, climate change caused by hydrates, is an area of current research. Preliminary estimates suggest no abrupt methane contribution to the environment from hydrates in the immediate future. Introduction Natural-gas hydrates (clathrates) are crystalline, ice-like solids that form when small (<9 Å) molecules contact water at low temperature and high pressure (Sloan and Koh 2008). Because hydrates are solids, they can block oil and gas flowlines; flow assurance involves considerable effort and expense to ensure that this blockage does not happen. Also, hydrates concentrate hydrocarbon gases by a volumetric factor of 164 (at standard temperature/pressure), such that large deposits of natural hydrates are becoming factors in energy resources and climate concerns in marine and permafrost deposits. A combination of applications, principally in flow assurance, energy, and, more recently, climate change, has driven hydrate engineering and science for 75 years. The number of published hydrate-related papers is an exponential function of time, extrapolating to more than two refereed publications per day in this decade. As Table 1 summarizes, triennial international hydrate conferences have been held since 1993; the most recent conference, in July 2008, presented more than 400 manuscripts.

AB  - AbstractShushufindi is the largest field in the Oriente Basin of Ecuador that was discovered by Texaco in 1970. It has produced about one billion barrels of oil over a period of 30 years. Early in the life of the field, peripheral water injection was implemented and was discontinued in 1999 based on the results of a previous reservoir simulation study carried out in late 90's. Currently, the field is producing significant amount of water under very active water drive mechanism. The field consists of three main stacked reservoirs: Basal Tena, U and T and have produced from about 185 completions. This paper is focused on the reservoirs U and T. Historically, most of the wells in the field were produced commingled from these two reservoirs. . This paper presents the results of an integrated reservoir study that was performed to optimize the field performance for effective reservoir management.A 3D reservoir simulation model was constructed to optimize the performance of the field and to find opportunities to increase oil production. A successful history match achieved helped understanding the reservoir behavior and field performance. Since many wells produced commingled from the reservoirs U and T, dynamic fluid allocation was also performed by means of full-field history matching process. Distribution and location of remaining oil after accounting for the incremental oil recovery due to the workover wells helped delineating the locations of infill and step-out wells to increase production.The results showed that reservoir pressure behavior was very erratic in both U and T reservoirs. However, the level of scatter was more pronounced in Reservoir U than in Reservoir T. Observed reservoir pressure trends seem to follow the channels observed from 2D seismic especially in reservoir U. However, local changes in the pressure trends could have been caused by the water injection. Some observations from the reservoir performance evaluation suggest that the erratic pressure behavior could also be attributed to the change in the formation compressibility due to fluid withdrawal and water injection.The results also show that the effect of peripheral water injection was very limited and infill water injection could improve sweep efficiency of the reservoirs.IntroductionThe Shushufindi field is located in the Oriente Basin of Ecuador, approximately 100 miles east of Quito as shown in Figure 1. The discovery well was spudded on December 4, 1968 reaching a final depth of 9772 feet, 156 feet within the Chapiza formation (non-economic basement).In early 1969, the exploratory well was completed in the U reservoir (U) and T reservoir (T) of the Napo Formation. The exploratory well Aguarico-1 in the north was completed in April 1969 in the U sandstone.The development-drilling program was initiated in February 1972 with a nominal well spacing of 50 acres. Official production started in August 1972. The main targets were the productive reservoirs in the field, which are T and U sands.In the initial development phase, Original Oil in Place was estimated at approximately 3,500 million barrels of oil. The original reserves of the field were estimated at 1,589 million barrels of oil. By September 2002, the field has produced an estimated 1,013 million barrels of oil. Consequently, the remaining reserves as estimated before this study are approximately 576 million barrels of oil.Initial reservoir pressures were 3,867 and 4042 psia for U and T respectively. By the end of 2002, pressures were 1800 psia for U, and 2500 psia for T. Based on saturation pressures of 1065 and 1265 psia for U and T respectively, and the observed decline rates, the reservoirs are considered under saturated with active water drive.In December 1984, a secondary recovery project was implemented through water injection in order to maintain the pressure and to increase the ultimate oil recovery. In 1999, water injection was suspended and has remained suspended to date. The daily average production in 2002 was 61,000 BOPD with 55% BSW from 61 wells. All the wells are producing under artificial lift mechanisms.The operatorship of this field was transferred to Petroproducción in the 1992 after 20 years of development and production. The last simulation model of the Shushufindi field was built in 1996 with 115 wells.

AB  - Summary The impact on simulated waterflood performance of adopting a"discrete" and simplified flow-unit representation of reservoirheterogeneity, rather than a conventional "smooth" model based oncontouring of petrophysical zonal averages, was assessed with a synthetic modelof a heterogeneous barrier-bar sand body. On the basis of comparativesimulations, the contour models did not generate consistently optimisticpredictions of reservoir performance (compared with their flow-unitcounterparts). performance (compared with their flow-unit counterparts).Individual well behavior, however, varied significantly according to modeltype. Introduction Production experience from mature fields in the North Sea (and Productionexperience from mature fields in the North Sea (and elsewhere) has shown thatreservoir simulation studies often have produced overly optimistic predictionsof the timing of water produced overly optimistic predictions of the timing ofwater breakthrough and ultimate recovery. It is now generally agreed that thisinaccuracy is more a consequence of inadequate representations of reservoirheterogeneity than fundamental inaccuracies in the differential equations usedto describe fluid flow. Petrophysical reservoir description models, which serveas the basic inputs to reservoir simulators, are conventionally produced bysubdividing the reservoir interval into a number of fieldwide layers (or zones)and contouring the petrophysical zonal averages between the wells. Theinterpolation can be computed or hand drawn by a geologist. Regardless of howit is done, the result is a model characterized by smooth, gradual changes inreservoir properties. Many reservoir types, however, include abrupt lateralproperties. Many reservoir types, however, include abrupt lateral changesbetween geological facies. These abrupt changes are not captured by acontouring approach. More recently, an alternative reservoir descriptionmethodology has emerged. It involves subdividing reservoirs into a 3D mosaic ofdiscrete volumes, or flow units, each mutually distinguishable by itsgeological characteristics and its ability to transmit fluids. In contrast tocontoured models, flow-unit models are inherently characterized by abruptlateral changes in petrophysical properties at flow-unit boundaries. Aflow-unit petrophysical properties at flow-unit boundaries. A flow-unitapproach currently is finding increased use, especially in stochasticheterogeneity modeling where discrete stochastic models are used to describelarge-scale reservoir heterogeneity. The purposes of this study werethree-fold. 1. To assess the effects of using (discrete) flow-unit vs. (smooth)contoured reservoir descriptions on simulated reservoir behavior duringwaterflooding of a heterogeneous reservoir. 2. To identify situations where thecontouring approach may be unreliable. 3. To gain some idea of the combinedeffects of reservoir heterogeneity and fluid-flow processes on reservoirperformance. A synthetic and simplified geological reservoir model wasconstructed as the basis for experimentation. The model, which was used as acontrolled laboratory, was then converted to a 3D mosaic of interlocking flowunits through the assignment of appropriate petrophysical values. Permeabilityanisotropy within the flow units petrophysical values. Permeability anisotropywithin the flow units and the degree of large-scale permeability heterogeneitybetween the flow units were altered systematically by varying the horizontaland vertical permeability values. In this manner, the synthetic reservoirmodels created ranged from moderately anisotropic and relatively homogeneous tostrongly anisotropic and relatively heterogeneous. A hypothetical waterflooddevelopment scenario was constructed and subsequently applied to four areas (orelements) within the overall geological model. Reservoir performance for eachof the element models was simulated in experimental pairs for each of thechosen levels of permeability heterogeneity and anisotropy; one for a flow-unitrepresentation and one for a corresponding contoured representation (based ondata from four hypothetical production and injection wells). production andinjection wells). The simulation results were used to evaluate the effects ofsimplifying heterogeneity through contouring. The flow-unit models served asstandards of comparison, with the assumption that they provide more correctrepresentations of the reservoirs' real provide more correct representations ofthe reservoirs' real heterogeneity. Synthetic Facies Architecture Model A regressive, barrier-bar sand-body complex, bounded above and below bytransgressive marine mudstones, was selected because of the widespreadoccurrence of such reservoirs in the Norwegian continental shelf. Barrier-barsand bodies are laterally and vertically continuous yet commonly contain acomplex mosaic of internal facies heterogeneities (cf., the "jigsawpuzzle" variety of Ref. 13). An extensive literature review was undertakento provide data concerning typical facies dimensions and architectures, as wellas the external dimensions of barrier bars. From this review, the syntheticmodel was designed to cover a 25-km 2 area [5 x 5 km] 25 m thick. Thesedimentological framework of the model comprises five laterally continuousfacies belts that migrated seaward during progradation of the barrier bar (Fig.1a). The model is progradation of the barrier bar (Fig. 1a). The model isrepresented by 5 x 5-m-thick gridblock layers (Fig. 1b). Note that simulationlayers cross cut the inclined facies belt boundaries, thereby providing anapproximate chrono-stratigraphic subdivision of the reservoir. Heterogeneitywithin each layer is defined by 13 facies (Table 1) in the various faciesbelts. The 3D heterogeneity model was produced by hand drawing the position ofthe facies within each of produced by hand drawing the position of the facieswithin each of the five layers (Fig. 2). The main reservoir sand body comprisesa coarsening-upward "beach-face" sequence including four facies types:an offshore transition zone, lower shore face, upper shore face, and foreshore.Tidal inlets, which cut through the beach face from the foreshore down to a fewmeters above the base of the lower shore face, switched positions more or lessrandomly as the beach face prograded. Backbarrier sandstones include floodtidal deltas and prograded. Backbarrier sandstones include flood tidal deltasand washover fans deposited along the seaward margin of the back-barrierlagoon. The lagoonal facies define the landward termination of the mainbarrierbar sand body. They also provide an impermeable lateral stratigraphicseal between the barrier island and the delta plain association. Heterogeneity and Anisotropy Parameterization It was then assumed that, at a gridblock scale, each facies could becharacterized (approximately) by constant petrophysical properties (which couldbe altered systematically for each properties (which could be alteredsystematically for each sensitivity run) and therefore could be regarded as aflow unit.

AB  - AbstractThe Steam-Assisted Gravity Drainage (SAGD) process has been successfully implemented to produce ultra-viscous bitumen from the Athabasca oil-sands in the Province of Alberta, Canada. In the Hangingstone area, 15 pairs of SAGD wells had been drilled by 2006 in the reservoir of maximum 30 m thickness and about 300 m depth. The production reached an average of 8,000 BOPD in recent years. The reservoir is geologically characterized as stacked incised valley fills in fluvial to upper-estuarine channels. Thin mudstone layers and abrupt changes in facies caused by the sedimentary deposits present complexities and difficulties for SAGD implementation. A 3D seismic survey was conducted in 2002 to obtain a clear view of geology that was fully utilized for planning additional wells. In order to evaluate SAGD efficiency and performance, a time-lapse 3D seismic survey was carried out in 2006. In this paper, P-wave velocity (Vp) maps transformed from the seismic travel-time maps were interpreted with a new methodology for evaluating the areal extent of the steamchamber zone created by the SAGD process. In the previous experimental study of seismic velocity measurements with oilsands cores, Vp was found to steeply drop with an increase in temperature and to gently decrease with an increase in pore pressure. Based on the experimental results, a petrophysical model was formulated to express Vp as a function of temperature, pressure, and water saturation. The high pressure and high temperature zone of the SAGD process should generate differences between the first (2002) and second (2006) Vp maps from which we can estimate the area of the reduced bitumen viscosity with a temperature increase. As effects of pressure are probably more areally extensive than effects of temperature, these two effects on the Vp maps need to be segregated. As a new method, a scaling factor for the Vp reduction was first estimated to adjust the laboratory scale and field scale. We then calculated a distribution of Vp reduction corresponding to steam-chamber conditions in order to decouple composite effects of temperature and pressure based on the petrophysical model. Distinguishing high temperature and high pore-pressure zone from low temperature and high pore-pressure zone, we could determine a steam-chamber distribution. The bitumen volume in the steam-chamber zone was estimated and compared with the actual production. The methodology, interpretation procedures, and the results obtained are presented in detail. IntroductionAlthough the oil price has dropped rapidly after the financial crisis in 2008, the development of unconventional oil resources like extra-heavy oil and oil shale still remains significant in the quest for increasing reserves or energy security (Stark et al. 2008). Such bituminous and heavy oil, however, complicates their production using normal techniques. Then, a variety of methods are developed to decrease high viscosity. The injection of heat or solvents is used extensively. The SAGD technique which was first designed by Butler (1992, 1994) is one of the most effective steam injection methods and it has been widely applied in Canadian oil-sand reservoirs. The steam movement is highly influenced by complex substructure in reservoirs.

AB  - ABSTRACTThere is a growing demand for corrosion, erosion and scale monitoring to meet the recognized need for more comprehensive asset integrity management. As the oil industry continue to extend the life of existing fields and expands to develop ever more challenging fields, online and real-time monitoring will play an important role in extending the life of existing fields, making new fields developments feasible, cost effective, reliable and safer to operate. Recent developments suggest that there are many technologies that can contribute to the advancement of online and real-time monitoring. These need to be adapted and exploited to meet the needs of the industry. There are fundamental changes which need to occur in the way monitoring and data interpretation are viewed to embrace these new technologies.INTRODUCTIONRecent events in the oil industry involving loss of integrity of export systems have highlighted the vulnerability of oil and gas supply worldwide and the importance of effective asset integrity management programs in maintaining the reliability of supply. To meet the needs of the market and secure supply companies are squeezing more output from existing reservoirs through extending the life of existing facilities and enabling greater tolerance for sand and water production. In addition, the drive to find additional reserves is leading companies to explore in more globally remote areas and at greater offshore water depths. These expansions underscore the need to exploit new technologies to make these developments economically attractive and to encourage further developments of complex and difficult fields such as high pressure/high temperature (HP/HT) and highly corrosive reservoirs. Future developments will likely consist of many remote fields both onshore and offshore, possibly with vast gathering systems that will bring the raw fluids into centrally located facilities to be processed and transported to export systems.Optimal development of these fields will require integrated operating systems that incorporate features of:Operational assurance monitoring ofFlow assurance parameters (hydrates, wax and asphaltenes, sand, etc.)System operability (slugs, foams, stagnant fluids, etc.)Product quality (BSW, crude quality, sulphur content, etc.)Asset integrity management systems to mitigateCorrosionScaleSand erosionCracking (environmentally induced cracking as well as mechanically induced cracking, such as fatigue)It is crucial that as current facilities life is extended and future fields are developed that on-line monitoring systems are retrofitted into existing assets and be incorporated into new facilities at the earliest stages of the design process. Operating systems have usually included some form of operational assurance monitoring even though they may not all have been online real-time technologies. The common incorporation of comprehensive integrity management monitoring technologies into the operating systems has been more problematic, even though the prevalent materials of construction choice, carbon and low alloy steel, are subject to the degradation mechanisms of corrosion, erosion, and several environmental cracking phenomena.To manage the integrity of aging assets and future field developments most effectively, facilities need to include monitoring systems that will provide early warnings to allow mitigation measures to be adjusted and/or initiated.

Abstract Following the general discussion of The Worldwide Occurrence of Abnormal Pressures Part I, Part II discusses some specific type Part I, Part II discusses some specific type examples in the United States, the North Sea, Africa and South East Asia. Introduction The following examples are selected as the general type example for the area under discussion. In each case the general trend of the pore pressure profile is plotted versus depth. pore pressure profile is plotted versus depth. Naturally, since each area is covered in a very general manner the type example is only a general example. When drilling, variations in the depositional pattern and in the position in a basin may cause an entirely different pressure profile. So these profiles are not to be profile. So these profiles are not to be considered as a drilling guide but rather as a general description of the conditions that have already been found in these areas. In all of the examples given the general mechanism is compression of the shales with the formation of a cap structure. As a guide, the cap structure and the general lithology of the area is indicated in the text. TYPICAL PRESSURE PROFILES CALIFORNIA - SANTA BARBARA CHANNEL (Figure 1) The Santa Barbara Channel of California is a deep trench, heavily faulted, that has received rapid deposition from the Coast Range mountains to the east. The normal sequence in the Santa Barbara Channel is sands and shales with sands predominating. Some deep drilling indicates that at 10,000' to 14,000' a massive shale forms a seal on a pressured section. While it has not been extensively penetrated, seismic records indicate that the pressure below the seal should rise over several thousand feet to an equivalent overburden value of 17 ppg. The section, as noted, is badly faulted, ppg. The section, as noted, is badly faulted, and in some cases fault blocks cause pressures to appear several thousands feet higher or lower than expected. CALIFORNIA - CALUSA COUNTY (Figure 2) In the typical profile, the section is a sand and shale sequence with a change to a massive limey shale at-about 4,000'. Pressures increase: to a pore pressure equivalent of about 121/2 ppg at 8,000'. At that point a limey sequence in the shale causes an abrupt increase in pore pressure to a probable overburden gradient at about 9,000' to 10,000'.

AB  - Abstract Selecting a drilling fluid from the learnings from conventional reservoirs can be a wrong choice when it is used for unconventional formations. Drilling fluid has a chemo-mechanical effect on the reservoir rock during exposure time; this interaction can be abrupt or imperceptible depending on minerals comprising the rock matrix and their chemical sensitivity to the fluid composition. Improper selection of drilling fluid may cause strong shale-fluid interaction and thus result in wellbore instability. This paper presents a comprehensive experimental study examining the effect of various drilling fluids on the mechanical properties of conventional and unconventional rock samples. Four drilling fluids with varying additives are selected to contact and saturate rock samples at the temperature of 230°F for 16 or 24 hours: Three of them are water-based muds (WBM) and the other one is an oil-based mud (OBM). Rock samples used are from the Berea sandstone, Mancos and Eagle Ford shale formations. For each type of rock, one plug is tested without contacting any drilling fluid and is used as a reference of geomechanical properties. Other samples are contacted and saturated with other drilling fluids before their geomechanical testing. A fluid-saturating process is conducted at a pressurized aging cell. Mechanical testing is performed in a servo-controlled triaxial apparatus in which samples are deformed at a constant confining pressure of 10 MPa and the drained condition. Experimental results show that drilling fluids have a negligible effect on the peak strength and Young's moduli of Berea sandstone. However, the peak strength of Mancos shales decreases dramatically while their Young's moduli change randomly. For Eagle Ford shales, fluids reduce both peak strength and Young's moduli. For all samples tested, their Poisson's ratios increase after samples are saturated with fluids. Compared to WBM, it is observed that OBM preserves the mechanical properties of Mancos shales much better. After optimizing the design of one high-performance water-based mud (HPWBM1), the new fluid (HPWBM2) has an improved performance (similar to OBM) in preserving shale geomechanical properties.

AB  - Abstract: Salt precipitation and accumulation in the wellbore is a common phenomenon witnessed in the twilight of gas wells; gas expansion, water evaporation, abrupt changes in pressure and temperature etc. are the main driving forces for its occurrence. Low reservoir pressures helps in water vaporization when quantity of water in gas phase is not high. Reduction in pressure thus causes water vaporization and hence salt accumulation. The salt precipitation results in obstruction of gas flow in purlieu of wellbore, if the problem is not rectified timely it might cease the wellbore completely resulting in complete loss of production. To restore production frequent wellbore cleanout jobs are required, these cleanout jobs are usually carried out through coiled tubing unit and different liquids are utilize ranging from fresh water, nitrified brine, organic acids etc. These all treatments are expensive and effect well economics. Few wells in United Energy Pakistan Limited (UEP) were facing salt precipitation problem and not flowing up to their potential rates, regular wellbore clean out jobs carried out but their impressions were not long lasting and salt again accumulated. In this paper, removal of salt deposition through regular deployment salt sticks on two wells K-1 and T-1 are discussed. In these wells salt sticks are used at different frequencies to overcome salt deposition. Post job results showed improvement in gas rates, gauge cutter runs also confirmed salt deposition is minimized and production is stabilized. Introduction: As gas wells progresses to the later stages of production their reservoir pressure decline, for wells with low water production rates the probability of exceeding solubility limit increases and problem of salt precipitation is often witnessed. The salt deposition occurs in the tubing and across perforations and hamper the flow from reservoir in to the wellbore.

AB  - Abstract: Injecting CO2 into aquifers at depths greater than 800 m brings CO2 to a supercritical state where its density is large enough to ensure an efficient use of pore space. However, CO2 may not be in thermal equilibrium with the medium when it enters the reservoir because pressure and temperature injection conditions at the wellhead can be diverse and CO2 will not equilibrate with the geothermal gradient if the flow rate is high. This is especially true when injecting liquid, i.e. cold, CO2, which is highly advantageous from the point of view of demanded compression energy. In such case, thermal stress changes will be induced, which will affect rock stability. Coupled thermo-hydro-mechanical simulations of CO2 injection produce a region around the injection well in thermal equilibrium with the injected CO2. Further away CO2 thermally equilibrates with the medium in an abrupt front. Thermal contraction of the reservoir can lead to shear slip of pre-existing fractures, triggering microseismic events, for large temperature contrasts in stiff rocks, which could enhance injectivity. In contrast, the mechanical stability of the caprock is improved in stress regimes where the maximum principal stress is the vertical.
