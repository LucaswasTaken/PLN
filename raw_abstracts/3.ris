AB  - Abstract Severe slugging in an offshore riser pipeline imposes a major challenge to production and flow assurance in the oil and gas industry. Riser top valve choking has shown effectiveness in eliminating severe slugging. However, most manual choking and active control techniques were tuned by trial and error resulting in operation at a smaller than required valve position. This imposes unnecessarily high back pressure on the riser-pipeline which leads to reduction in production. One way to overcome this problem is to design the active control system to operate at a large valve position. However, at such an operating point, the riser pipeline system is naturally open-loop unstable associated with severe slugging flows. In this work, an approach to tune a robust PID slug controller at an open-loop unstable condition is proposed. Firstly, at an open-loop unstable operating condition, a reliable linear model is derived from the nonlinear simplified riser-separator model (SRSM) developed in previous work. Then, a robust stabilizing PID controller is designed based on the linearised model. The controller was successfully applied to a 2?? laboratory riser at Cranfield University and a 8?? generic industrial riser system modeled in the commercial simulator, OLGA. OLGA simulation on the industrial riser system shows that the proposed approaches not only can eliminate severe slugging but can also increase oil production. It also shows that the percentage improvement in oil production compared with manual choking will increase as the well pressure declines. This means that even more can be gained by adopting active slug control for mature oil fields than for relatively new fields. The result is very significant for mature fields which are susceptible to severe slugging and low oil production due to declining reservoir pressure. Keywords Severe slugging, Pipeline-riser, Unstable systems, Robust PID tuning, Oil production, Mature fields 1. Introduction Severe slugging in an offshore riser-pipeline system is one of the most undesired flow regimes due to its potential to initiate and sustain system instability. Due to huge variation in pressure and flow associated with it, its consequences in oil and gas production are of a very serious concern. Severe pressure and flow oscillations can cause depletion of reservoir performance and productivity, poor phase separation, compressor overloading, trips and production deferment.  Conversely, a slug control system will eliminate or reduce the occurrence of these adverse conditions. The primary objective of a slug control system is to stabilise the riser-pipeline system by suppressing severe slugging.  Conventional solutions to address this severe slugging issue include design modification of upstream facilities(Fargharly, 1987, Makogan and Brook, 2007), riser base gas lift(Alvarez and Al-Malik, 2003, Cousin and Johal, 2000, Duret and Tran, 2002, Al-Kandari and Koleshwar, 1999, Jansen and Shoham, 1994, Meng and Zhang, 2001, Pots et al 1987), gas re-injection(Tengesdal et al, 2002), homogenising the multiphase flow(Hassanein and Fairhurst, 1998), installation of slug catchers and riser topside valve choking(Schmidt et al, 1980). Among these solutions, choking transforms the unstable flow in the riser to stable flow; however, it induces extra back pressure on the pipeline. Active feedback, feed forward and cascade control systems have been applied to dynamic choking for slug control (Henriot et al 1999, Drengstig and Magndal 2001, Jasen et al 1996, John-Morten et al, 2005, Molyneux and Kinvig, 2000, Storkaas et al, 2001, Storkaas and Skogestad, 2004).

AB  - Severe slugging is an important flow assurance issue, typically observed in offshore pipeline-riser systems. The consequences of severe slugging include flooding of downstream production facilities and an overall decrease in productivity. It had been previously thought that severe slugging would be limited to systems with a downward inclined pipeline and vertical, catenary or lazy-S shaped riser. This paper presents the results of an experimental and modeling study, which demonstrates the existence of severe slugging in systems with upward inclined lateral flow paths such as a toe-down well. The severe slugging phenomena described in this paper was observed in a large scale experimental facility constructed for the purpose of studying flow behavior in horizontal wells. The facility enabled the study of the effect of the completion parameters like end of tubing location and the presence of a packer. Various gas and liquid rates were tested in the facility, and slug flow was the dominant flow pattern in the lateral section. The facility was also designed to test gas lift performance in horizontal wells. Therefore, the effect of gas lift on the severe slugging phenomenon was also studied. Based on the experimental observations, two severe slugging prediction models were developed. The first was a transient model based on the Balino et al. (2010) model. The second was a single point criterion based on the Bøe (1981) criterion. The constitutive equations and modeling results are also presented in this paper.

AB  - AbstractSevere slugging has been experienced in most of Upper Zakum pipeline riser-pipe system. It is characterised by generation of slugs ranging in length from one to several riser-pipe heights; occurs at low gas and liquid flow rates in undulated, nearly horizontal, pipeline. The significance of this study arises from the fact that it is an extensive field application and is not a small scale simulation as the case in most published works. This study has covered wide range of pipe diameters, pipe lengths, and flow rates. By the merit of data acquiring telesystem, after the grace of God, considerable volume of data were collected so accurately that each variable was monitored every 10 seconds. These data were extracted from computer terminal at company min office in Abu Dhabi. Screened data were applied to predict severe slugging map. The same data were compared with a hydrodynamic computer model developed to predict the slug behavior. Methods to alleviate or to eliminate severe slugging are discussed. Riser-pipe choking has been found to be an effective solution. Introduction:- Gas and liquid in Upper ZAKUM Field are frequently travelling in two phases with different flow patterns. At low gas and liquid flow rates, abnormal long liquid slugs are generated upstream the receiving platforms and forced into the processing facilities in a very erratic manner associated with gas surges. This phenomena imposes unstable production condition. Fig. 1.0 is a general perspective view of separation platform where slug flow is experienced in the incoming riser-pipes. in fact, processing of long liquid slugs is not an easy exercise specially as it would necessitate the over sizing of production facilities. In some production facilities. In some production separators, liquid carry over production separators, liquid carry over was encountered at average production rate less than 50% of it's nominated capacity. This anomaly is attributed to the high slug velocity in the riser which might reach momentarily 40 times the average liquid velocity in the pipeline. Therefore, the concept of over sizing the production facilities is not envisaged to solve the associated problem at least in U/Z Field. P. 299

AB  - SummaryRecently, exploitation of offshore petroleum reservoirs has moved to ever-increasing water depths. Production from fields in water deeper than 1800 m is now a reality. The use of long deepwater risers that conduct production from multiple wellheads on the seafloor to the surface predisposes the system to severe slugging in the riser for a wide range of flow rates and seabed topography. Considering the length of the deepwater risers, the problem is expected to be more severe than in production systems installed in shallower waters. Severe slugging could occur at a high pressure, with the magnitude of the pressure fluctuations so large as to cause a shorter natural-flow period with subsequent consequences, such as premature field abandonment, loss of recoverable reserves, and earlier-than-planned deployment of boosting devices.In this study, a novel idea to lessen or eliminate severe slugging in pipeline/riser systems has been investigated. The principle of the technique is to transfer the pipeline gas to the riser at a point above the riser base. The transfer process will reduce both the hydrostatic head in the riser and the pressure in the pipeline, consequently lessening or eliminating the severe slugging by maintaining the steady-state two-phase flow in the riser. In this paper, a steady-state model is presented. It can be used as a design tool for the self-lifting concept by determining the operation envelope for a successful self-lift operation; given the location of the gas takeoff or injection points, it can predict the acceptable range of pressure losses in the gas bypass for continuous steady-state operation of the self-gas-lift system. The model was found to perform very well when compared to the acquired experimental data.IntroductionSevere slugging can occur in two-phase-flow systems in which a pipeline segment with a downward inclination angle is followed by another segment/riser with an upward-inclination angle. For such a system at relatively low gas- and liquid-flow rates, liquid can accumulate at the riser base, blocking the gas flow. This will consequently result in an increasing level of liquid in the riser until the liquid reaches the riser top. Simultaneously, gas in the downward-inclined section will be compressed. When the gas pressure in the pipeline has increased enough to counter the hydrostatic head of the liquid column, the gas will expand and push the liquid column violently out of the riser into the separator. Severe slugging will cause periods of no liquid and gas production in the separator, followed by very high liquid- and gas-flow rates. The resulting large pressure and flow-rate fluctuations are highly undesirable; sudden surges in liquid production could cause overflow and shut down the separator. Fluctuations in gas production could result in operational and safety problems during flaring, and the high pressure fluctuations could negatively impact the field's production performance and ultimately lead to a reduction in recoverable reserves. Currently, there are three basic elimination methods that have been proposed: backpressure increase, gas lift, and choking. All other proposed techniques are based on these three elimination methods. The backpressure-increase method eliminates severe slugging by increasing the system pressure, and thereby, significantly reducing the production capacity. In gas lifting, external gas is injected into either the riser or pipeline at the riser bottom to reduce the hydrostatic head in the riser or to increase the gas-flow rate in the pipeline. Gas-lift equipment requires a large footprint on the platform and large amounts of gas to accomplish the elimination. The operational cost of gas lifting can be very significant.

AB  - AbstractThis paper discusses a recently completed FEED and post-FEED flow assurance study for the development of two satellite crude oil producing systems in West Africa. A 33 km 24 in. trunkline will transport the satellite field production to the main field.With a gas/liquid two-phase trunkline, terrain induced slugging required a slug catcher that was too big to be cost-effective. To mitigate the severe slugging problem, a gas/liquid separator was recommended at the inlet of the satellite manifold and the liquid surge volume could be completely eliminated. A 4 in. separate gas pipeline was adequate to avoid surge capacity requirements at the outlet.The demulsifier becomes less effective at watercuts (WC) greater than 60% and the peak viscosity can be as high as 10,000 cp. The restricting factors are the maximum-allowable-operating-pressure (MAOP) of 46 bara for the pipeline startup. A two-step ramp-up schedule was recommended to keep the peak pressure to an acceptable level.A limited number of well VSDs (Variable Speed Drive for ESP wellhead control) are required based on the slower ramp-up scheme and production profile.Some guidelines are given in this paper for managing emulsion crude oil system issues.IntroductionThe N-field/M-field project consists of the development of two additional satellite fields that feed an FSO on the West African coast.The N-field is located approximately 5 km northeast of the existing MND Gathering Station. The majority of the production comes from the M-field located approximately 33 km northwest of the MND Gathering Station. The additional production from N-field/M-field will be tied into the existing facilities and infrastructure in West Africa.Recoverable reserves for the two field areas are estimated at approximately 100 million barrels of crude.The development plan calls for 5 producing wells in N-field and 25 wells in M-field.Electric submersible pumps (ESP's) will be used as the primary method of artificial lift.Under certain conditions, oil and water may form an emulsion that will not separate at the surface without special treatment. An emulsion is a colloidal dispersion of liquid droplets in another liquid phase (oil-in-water or water-in-oil emulsion, depending on which is the continuous phase).As watercut increases, emulsification of oil results in a significantly increased viscosity that severely hampers wellbore and pipeline delivery capabilities.Demulsifiers are products used to break or prevent the formation of emulsions. Most of the demulsifier products are hydrophilic surfactants that have the ability to revert the water-in-oil emulsion into two separate phases. The following key technical issues were considered in the study:Maximize standardization of design and equipment to reduce project costs.Include turndown capability needed in early and late life. The production profiles are based on reservoir simulation. The peak rate in the pipeline sizing should reflect a 90% service factor.Optimize the trunkline and well flowline and determine the correct trade-off between ESP horsepower and pipeline diameter.Determine surge volume requirements for the M-field trunkline slug catcher (co-mingled with N-field at the end of the M-field trunkline).Test VSD requirements for cold startup and shutdown scenarios. Transient modeling is required to determine an optimal start-up procedure that will aid in defining VSD requirements.

AB  - Terrain or severe slugging has been observed operationally in a 5-mile long subsea oil tie-back when certain wells or combination of wells are flowed back to the platform through the test line. The flowlines have a downward incline to the base of the riser that enhances terrain or severe slugging. Under operating conditions with slugging, the tuned flow management tool failed to predict any slugging. Additionally, according to multiphase flow analysis with a commercial transient simulator during design studies, slugging was not predicted except for significantly lower flowrates and higher water cuts. Recent rigorous modelling highlighted significant differences to the resulted slugging predictions depending on the modelling approach and different versions of the tested simulator, OLGA®. Also the commercial transient simulator LedaFlow® was tested yielding similar results to OLGA® with same input parameters. Some slugging mitigation methods shown through modelling to mitigate slugging have been tested in the field without success. While the more rigorous modelling achieved better agreement with operating data, still poor accuracy was achieved. The inability to properly capture multiphase flow characteristics during the design phase of the project has led to an under-designed system and significant process upsets. 1 INTRODUCTION The accurate prediction of multiphase flow phenomena has been the topic of research for many years. Even though steady state conditions can usually be predicted with good accuracy, significant efforts are still being expended to model transient flow phenomena, such as various slug types and transient operating conditions, such as shut-downs, blowdowns, restarts, and ramp-ups. Accurate steady state and transient flow assurance analyses during early design phases are paramount to the further engineering of a subsea oil or gas project. Slugging inherently creates significant issues in the topsides process train due to large fluctuations in operating conditions.

AB  - ABSTRACTThe formation and evolution of slugs formed in air/water mixture in inclined pipes has been characterized as a function of flow conditions, pipe length and inclination angle. Good agreement was found with model predictions and experimental observations available from literature. Two regimes were identified: hydrodynamic slugging and a regime characterized by the occurrence of liquid backflow. The transition between these regimes was found to be a function of inclination angle. For a number of insert devices, the slug dissipation capabilities have been experimentally evaluated. The pressure fluctuations due to slug flow could be reduced up to 16%, albeit at the cost of added pressure drop to the total system.

AB  - ABSTRACT: A Lagrangian three-phase slug tracking model is demonstrated for a severe slugging case with gas, oil and water in an S-shaped riser. The model is an extension of a hybrid twophase flow scheme in which a two-fluid model formulation is used in the stratified flow region. In the slug body region, an incompressible flow model is applied. Mass and momentum conservation equations are solved for open and moving control volumes. This moving grid formulation allows for tracking of discontinuities within the flow, without numerical diffusion. A sub-grid two-fluid model in the bubble region allows for slug initiation directly from the two-fluid model in combination with a fine grid. Alternatively, a mechanistic slug initiation model may be used in combination with a coarse grid. The model is presented and applied to a severe slugging case in which oilwater separation occurs during slug build-up. The third phase is modeled with a mass conservation equation and an oil/water slip model in a mixture liquid momentum equation formulation. 1 INTRODUCTION The introduction of nuclear power generation in the mid 1950s increased the need for accurate and reliable methods to predict two-phase steam and water flows in pipe networks. This led to the development of several commercial codes for one-dimensional two-phase pipe simulation. Almost two decades later, a new field of application of the multiphase technology arose with the emergence of oil and gas production from deep water offshore fields. Several codes specifically designed for such systems were developed. These tools were to a large extent based on the modelling and simulation principles originally introduced with the nuclear technology, and were mainly suited for simulation of two-phase oil and gas flows. Here, an algebraic slip model for the relative velocity between the oil and the water was utilized.

The flow of gas into the riser can be blocked by liquid accumulation at the base of the riser. This may cause formation of liquid slugs longer than the height of the riser. An undesirable cyclic process results, in which a period of no liquid production into the separator occurs, followed by a period of high production into the separator occurs, followed by a period of high liquid production.Traditional methods for severe slugging elimination are choking and gas lifting. Each of these methods suffers from operational disadvantages. Choking can increase the back pressure, thus, reducing production. Gas lift, on the other hand, requires large volumes of injected gas.The objective of this paper is to find the changes in operational conditions caused by choking and gas lift and to propose an optimum method for elimination of severe slugging. The method proposed is a combination of choking and gas lift. This combination proposed is a combination of choking and gas lift. This combination utilizes the advantages of both methods and reduces the operational problems. The proposed method is insensitive to choke setting and problems. The proposed method is insensitive to choke setting and injected gas volume, as compared to elimination by either choking or gas lift alone. Further advantage is the capability of a smooth and controlled start-up of the system.An experimental investigation has been conducted to verify the full extent of the benefits obtained by the proposed optimum method. Data analysis revealed that the combination of choking and gas lift will highly reduce both the required degree of choking and the amount of injected gas needed for severe slugging elimination.A theoretical model has been developed to predict the flow behavior for the proposed optimum elimination method. The model can be used to design the operation of production systems that might operate under severe slugging. Excellent agreement between the model and the experimental data was obtained.

AB  - Summary. Small-scale experiments are described that simulate the unstable two-phase flow pattern of severe slugging often found in offshore flowline/riser systems. In particular, the effects of riser-base supplementary gas lift, flowline orientation, and liquid viscosity have been examined. To place the tests in perspective, the physics of severe slugging is discussed, including a method for scaling between model and prototype situations. Test results are compared with a simple hydrodynamic prototype situations. Test results are compared with a simple hydrodynamic computer model. IntroductionAt an offshore platform receiving an oil/gas two-phase stream from a long flowline, production may be in the form of long liquid slugs and gas surges instead of being smooth. Fig. 1 shows a typical off-shore flowline/riser configuration. When the length of the liquid slug exceeds the length of the riser, severe slugging, as opposed to normal slugging, is said to occur. In normal slug flow, slugs are not very long, on the order of 20 pipe diameters. In severe slugging, however, the liquid slugs build up at the riser base; consequently, the gas is trapped and accumulates upstream until the flowline pressure is high enough to drive the slug out of the riser. Such slugs may be many times the riser length, and the difference between peak and steady-state oil and gas production rates may be considerable. Unless special measures are taken, the processing of long liquid slugs and gas surges may be associated with liquid carryover or liquid- and pressure-control problems at the oil/gas separator. The separator may thus become inoperable at its design capacity, leading to possible production losses. The seriousness of severe slugging increases possible production losses. The seriousness of severe slugging increases when a large number of flowline/riser systems arrive at one platform separator by means of a manifold and when water depths are about 400 m [1,300 ft]. In situations where the oil/gas flow is received from a well with a bottomhole pressure just sufficient to sustain the required production, severe slugging may have a detrimental effect on production, production, severe slugging may have a detrimental effect on production, and even well killing is not unimaginable. Research into severe slugging is aimed at the reliable prediction of its occurrence and of the associated slug length, frequency, and arrival velocity. In addition, techniques should be developed to eliminate or to reduce severe slugging where possible; for example additional backpressure, choking, extra gas lift, and reduced pipeline diameter have been proposed by Yocum and Schmidt et pipeline diameter have been proposed by Yocum and Schmidt et al. These authors carried out comprehensive studies on severe slugging, including small-scale tests, field tests, and hydrodynamic modeling. Nevertheless, there are questions still to be answered. Since this paper was originally prepared, further related articles have been published. Taitel provided a theoretical analysis of severe slugging and its stabilization by an increase in backpressure or by use of controlled choking. Goldzberg and McKees discussed liquid accumulation and severe terrain-induced slugging. To predict severe slugging and to develop elimination techniques for offshore applications, tests have been carried out in a smallscale, 50-mm [2-in.] -diameter, 15-m [50-ft] -high flowline/riser system under near-atmospheric conditions. A long flowline has been simulated by addition of a large gas buffer to a shorter (30-m [ 100-ft]) flowline. In particular, gas injection at the riser base has been examined as a means of reducing severe slugging. The effects of gas and liquid flow rates, flowline inclination, and the presence of flowline undulations, riser-foot geometry, and liquid presence of flowline undulations, riser-foot geometry, and liquid viscosity have also been investigated. Liquid-viscosity effects are of interest with respect to two-phase flow with water cuts where high-viscosity oil/water emulsions can be expected. Further, a simple hydrodynamic model has been developed, and results obtained with it are compared with experimental data. This model has great similarity to that presented by Schmidt et al. Physics of Severe Slugging Severe-Slugging Group. For severe slugging to occur, the flowline gas flow must be completely inhibited during slug buildup (e.g., as a result of a partly declining flowline or the presence of flowline undulations), and the rate of hydrostatic pressure buildup in the riser resulting from the growth of the slug must exceed the rate of gaspressure buildup in the flowline. Under such conditions, the riser becomes filled with liquid before the gas pressure can drive the liquid slug out of the line. Assuming no mass transfer between the phases. PL »pg, and a vertical riser, and neglecting liquid fallback in the riser, we can express the ratio between these pressure buildup rates as (1) If IIss less than 1, then severe slugging could occur. As can be observed from Eq. 1, this severe-slugging group, IIss, depends mainly on the gas-to-liquid mass flow ratio, or gas/liquid ratio (GLR), and the effective flowline length, the latter being the product of actual flowline length and average flowline gas holdup, which represents the volume of the gas buffer. Given the GLR of a field and the flowline length, the severe-slugging group, IIss, is dependent on only the gas holdup. Additional system backpressure would decrease this gas holdup and could eliminate severe slugging, but as Schmidt et al. noted, a substantial increase in backpressure is needed. This would be accompanied by the risk of production losses. As an example, consider a 6-km [3.7-mile] flowline transporting a 90-std-m 3/M [500-scf/bbl] oil/gas mixture with an average flowline gas holdup of 50%. Here, IIss = 1/3 to 1/4, indicating that the occurrence of severe slugging is possible. Because the expected slug length is Ls = LRIIss, the slug lengths could be three to four times the riser length. Longer flowlines, which increase the gas buffer volume, and lower GLR'S, which reduce the pressure buildup rate in the flowline, increase the possibility of severe slugging. Throughout this paper, we use this field case as an example. Further relevant data include the following: pipe diameter is 150 mm [6 in.]. liquid viscosity is 10 mpa.s [10 cp], and riser-base pressure is 2.4 MPa [350 psia]. The field base case has a liquid pressure is 2.4 MPa [350 psia]. The field base case has a liquid flow of 950 m /d 16,000 B/D]. SPEPE

AB  - ABSTRACTIn designing control systems for stabilization of severe riser slugging by active choking, there is a need for simplified system models. In this contribution, a simplified dynamic model for riser slugging is presented, based on mass and momentum conservation equations. The performance of the model was verified against existing experimental data of an S-shaped riser test loop. The dynamic model will be further applied to improve active feedback control schemes in platform risers, in case of severe slugging problems.

AB  - ABSTRACTThree slug types were found in the new lab experiments carried out in a 2” flowline-riser system with 477 litre volume operating at ambient pressure: severe slugging of type I (which has a liquid slug length larger than the riser height), severe slugging of type II (having a liquid slug length smaller than the riser height), and small scale slugs initiated in the flowline that prevent the severe slugging cycle. Slug predictions with the OLGA model are in good agreement with the experiments, as well as with other experiments for similar, but smaller, configurations described in the literature. The model also agrees with the severe slugging cycle of the Gannet system in the North Sea. The lab experiments show that gas lift mitigates the type I slugging cycle, but it does not fully remove it. Experiments for gas lift with the type II severe slugging cycle show that the cycle is removed if the superficial lift gas velocity is above 0.75 m/s. No effect of gas lift is found for the experiments where the severe slugging cycle was absent anyhow due to hydrodynamic slugging in the flowline. The OLGA predictions for the effect of gas lift for the three slug types are in reasonable agreement with the lab experiments. Particularly the experiments and simulations show that gas lift is not very effective for slug control.

AB  - AbstractThe occurrence of the severe slugging phenomenon in multiphase pipelines can cause serious and troublesome operational problems within the receiving process facilities.This paper describes: the pipeline operability studies on the Dunbar to Always multiphase pipeline regarding riser-induced severe slugging; the control scheme selected to prevent this phenomenon; and the subsequent operating experience. The pipeline operability studies involving dynamic simulations concluded that riser-induced severe slugging could occur over a wide range of production rates, in particular when the ElIon gas is unavailable.The challenge for TOTAL was to develop an operating strategy and a control scheme in order to eliminate severe slugging and operate the pipeline without significant process upset.An automatic control scheme was selected which offered a cost effective solution and ensured the safety of the existing process installations. Its originality was that it was based on a Riser Base Pressure Control.Since the initial start-up in December 1994, this selected scheme has proven to be successful and has enabled the pipeline operations in the riser-induced severe slugging region to be carried out without any difficulty.IntroductionThe Dunbar field is situated in the UK sector of the northern North Sea, approximately 22 km to the South of Alwyn North field which has been operated since the end of 1987 (Fig. 1 and Fig. 2).The recent development of the Dunbar field and its satellite ElIon comprises a production platform linked to the Alwyn North platform by a 16' multiphase pipeline (Fig. 3). The gas from El- Ion (Subsea wells) and the oil and gas from Dunbar are co-mingled and the overall well-fluid production is routed without separation to the Alwyn North processing and treatment facilities.The Dunbar 16' Multiphase Pipeline has been designed to export the Dunbar and Ellen production to Alwyn North (NAB platform) at a maximum flow of 49000 BOPD and 7.9 MMSCMD. Over a wide range of production rates, in particular when the ElIon gas is unavailable, the pipeline operation is in an unstable region where riser- induced severe occurs.The purpose of this document is :. to give a short description of the flow regimes predicted in the DUNBAR 16' Multiphase Pipeline and in particular of the severe slugging phenomenon. to present the operating strategy and the control system developed by TOTAL in order to prevent severe slugging and to operate the pipeline without occurrence of significant process upsets. and to give a feed-back of the pipeline operation at low flow rates 1. Flow regimes and severe sluggingThe pipeline profile of the Dunbar 16' pipeline is represented in Fig. 4. The flow regime map for this pipeline operated at a NAB riser-base pressure of 74 is given in Fig. 5 This map was based on the results of dynamic simulations performed with the OLGA pipeline software.

AB  - Abstract Developments in extended reach drilling and completion technologies allow to economically access a number of scattered small hydrocarbon pockets and will open up further opportunities for maximizing recovery from these fields. Effective use of these developments requires us to better understand the transient multiphase flow behaviour. Undulation is associated to horizontal wells with some degrees of deviation from the horizontal. The inclination angle could be a result of a lack of sufficient drilling control or could be designed on purpose, for instance, fish-hook wells, snake wells and undulating wells. A complicated and undulating trajectory may initiate severe slugging at the bottom of a wellbore. In this paper, OLGA, a commercial transient two-fluid multiphase flow simulator, and Cheng's inflow performance relationship were coupled together to characterize severe slugging. Simulation shows that severe slugging is formed at the bottom of the wellbore and moved up to the surface. Furthermore, it creates pressure pulsation at the bottom of the wellbore that can influence the reservoir performance. Introduction Fish-hook wells, snake wells and undulating wells are relatively new technologies and have been used to develop hydrocarbon fields more efficiently than conventional wells. Much of the world's oil exists in scattered and isolated pockets. As these deposits are small, it is not economically feasible to exploit them in a conventional way. Based on their geological settings, the optimal well trajectory could be a fish-hook well, where its geometry is in the shape of a fish-hook with the deepest reservoirs drilled first and the shallowest reservoirs at the end of the wellbore. It could also be a snake well that follows a complex undulating path and snakes back and forth to reach a number of different reservoir pockets. Another example is an undulated horizontal well for an extremely anisotropic formation, when vertical permeability is much smaller than horizontal permeability. In that case an undulating well may be drilled to overcome the low vertical permeability and increase the well productivity. As a horizontal well gets longer and follows a more complicated and undulating trajectory, wellbore hydrodynamics plays an important role in well performance, especially when two-phase gas-liquid flow is involved. In this paper we address a phenomenon named severe slugging, happening at the bottom of a wellbore close to hydrocarbon reservoirs. At relatively low gas and liquid flow rates, liquid will have the tendency to accumulate at a low spot in the wellbore, blocking over time a free passage of the gas phase. However, as production at the well continuous, the compressed upstream gas will flush out the liquid phase that has been accumulated in this lower part of the wellbore.  Thereby, it creates a relatively long liquid slug that is pushed out of the wellbore. After this liquid surge, and subsequent gas surge, part of the liquid in the wellbore falls back to this low spot to create a new blockage and the cycle repeats. These slugs create potential problems for the receiving surface facilities like separators, pumps, and compressors, which are designed to operate under steady state conditions. Moreover, they create pressure oscillations at the bottom of the wellbore that can influence the production rates at the oil and gas well. Severe slugging was first reported in offshore oilfield production systems by Yocum (1973). In an offshore oil and gas production facility, pipeline-riser systems are required to transport multiphase hydrocarbons from wellheads to a central production platform. Severe slugging in pipeline-riser systems has been studied by several investigators. In Fig. 1 different stages of a cycle of severe slugging are illustrated.

AB  - ABSTRACT Based on the success of foam in subsurface applications it is of interest to investigate whether foam can also help overcome liquid management problems in surface flowline-riser systems. Therefore, flow experiments were carried out in the flow loop at the Shell Technology Centre Amsterdam. The facility consists of a 100 m long horizontal flowline (with 50.8 mm diameter) followed by a 16.8-m vertical riser (with 44 mm diameter). Air and water are the working fluids, and operation is at atmospheric outlet pressure. Foam is created by adding “Dreft™” (a dishwashing detergent) in various concentrations to the water/air flow. Experiments were taken both without and with foam. Various measurement techniques were used: differential pressure sensors, flow visualization, and Distributed Acoustic Sensors (DAS) (fibre optics). The focus is on (growing) slugs in the horizontal flowline, and severe slugging in the flowline-riser. It can be concluded from the small-scale lab experiments that adding a surfactant mitigates (growing) slugs in (nearly) horizontal flowlines, whereas the severe slugging cycle in a flowline-riser configuration cannot be broken.

AB  - Deepwater Gulf of Mexico wells that exhibit liquid loading and subsea flowlines that suffer fluid slugging are both common issues that have historically been difficult to mitigate without expensive hardware changes or deferral of production. A novel black oil foamer (BOF) chemical technology has shown to be able to mitigate liquid loading, increase production, and reduce fluid slugging in both dry tree wells, subsea wells, and subsea flowlines. This presentation will detail three example cases where the black oil foamer technology was utilized successfully. For the first example case, liquid loading was the primary issue leading to shortened production time between shut-ins, causing slugging, and reduced overall production rates. For the second example, significant slugging was experienced in an 18-mile subsea tieback to the point that the field would be shut in for topside vessel level controller issues. The final case trialed different well lineups that would historically cause severe slugging in an 11 mile subsea tieback. In the first example, the benefits of using the black oil foamer included increased oil production and greatly improved well uptime, as well as significantly reducing slugging. The benefits demonstrated in the second and third examples were a significant reduction in slugging, allowing the field to operate with minimal shut-in risk and reducing equipment damage. Novel & Additive Information All three examples have proven the concept of using the black oil foamer chemistry to manage liquid loading and slugging risks in deepwater applications in an economically advantageous way.

AB  - AbstractSlug flow was studied in a simulated, offshore, pipeline-riser pipe system. Two distinct slug flow patterns were identified: severe slugging and normal slug flow. Severe slugging, characterized by generation of slugs ranging in length from one to several riser pipe heights, occurs at low gas and liquid flow rates and for negative pipeline inclinations. A mathematical model was developed for severe slugging. Results agree well with experimental data. Choking was found to be an effective method of eliminating severe slugging. IntroductionGas and liquid frequently are transported simultaneously in pipes, such as in gas and oil fields, in refineries and process plants, and in steam injection and geothermal production systems. When two-phase flow occurs in a pipeline, the phases separate in the pipe into various flow patterns. When the flow pattern at the exit of a pipe consists of alternating slugs of gas and liquid, special operating procedures frequently are required. Slugging in some of these facilities has required the use of operating procedures which drastically curtail production. Yocum reported that flow capacity reductions up to 50% have been necessary to minimize slugging on offshore platforms. The reported losses occur when platform backpressure is increased until a flow regime is reached in which slugging and pressure fluctuations are reduced to levels which can be handled by gathering facilities. Cady used an existing vertical flow pattern map to determine the conditions under which slugging would occur in a riser. Schmidt et al. described a comprehensive review of slugging problems of this nature and proposed automatic choking as a means of alleviating slugging in risers. This study describes the generating of long liquid slugs in a pipeline-riser pipe system and develops a mathematical method to predict slug characteristics. In addition, it has been found that severe slug flow can be eliminated or minimized by careful choking which results in little or no change in either flow rate or pipeline pressure and in elimination of pressure fluctuations. Description of Equipment An experimental facility was designed and constructed to permit study of flow in a pipeline-riser pipe system. The fluids flowed through a 100-ft-long, 2-in.-diameter pipeline and then up a 50-ft-long, 2-in.-diameter vertical riser. All pipe was made of Lexan and was transparent. Both sections are supported by aluminum I-beams that can be pivoted at their free ends through angles of +/- 5 degrees, to the horizontal and vertical. This study was conducted at pipeline angles of -5, -2, 0, and +5 degrees, with the riser pipe vertical. The fluids used in the study, air and kerosene, were mixed at the entrance of the test section, At the end of the test section, the air/kerosene mixture was separated in a horizontal separator. The air was vented, and the kerosene was returned to a storage tank. Kerosene was pumped from the tank into the system by means of a single-stage Gould centrifugal pump. The liquid flow rate was metered with a Camco 4-in, orifice meter and a Brooks rotameter. The air was obtained from a Joy two-stage compressor with a maximum output capacity of 0.6 MMscf/D at 120 psig. A Camco 2-in. orifice meter and a 0.75-in. Daniel orifice meter were used to measure the air flow rates. On each test section there were two pressure taps separated by a 25-ft span. SPEJ P. 407^

AB  - Summary Severe slugging in an offshore riser pipeline imposes a major challenge to production and flow assurance in the oil and gas industry. Riser-top-valve choking has shown effectiveness in eliminating severe slugging. However, most manual-choking and active-control techniques were tuned by trial and error, resulting in an operation at a smaller-than-necessary valve position for a stable-flow condition. This imposes unnecessarily high backpressure on the riser pipeline, which leads to reduction in production. One way to overcome this problem is to design the active-control system to operate at a large valve position. However, at such an operating point, the riser-pipeline system is naturally open-loop unstable associated with severe slugging flows. In this work, an approach to tune a robust proportional-integral-derivative (PID) slug controller at an open-loop unstable condition is proposed. First, at an open-loop unstable operating condition, a reliable linear model is derived from the nonlinear simplified riser/separator model (SRSM) developed in previous work. Then, a robust stabilizing PID controller is designed on the basis of the linearized model. The controller was successfully applied to a 2-in. laboratory riser at Cranfield University and an 8-in. generic industrial riser system modeled in the commercial multiphase-flow simulator OLGA. Simulation on the industrial riser system shows that the proposed approaches not only can eliminate severe slugging but also can increase oil production. It also shows that the percentage improvement in oil production compared with manual choking will increase as the well pressure declines. This means that adopting active slug control is even more beneficial for mature oil fields than for relatively new fields. The result is very significant for mature fields that are susceptible to severe slugging and low oil production because of declining reservoir pressure.

AB  - A systematic experimental study on two-phase air-water was carried out to evaluate the existence of severe slugging in toe-up gas wells. Experiments were conducted in a facility with a 2-in. ID and 62.6-ft. long lateral section and a 41-ft. vertical section. The lateral section was inclined -1° with respect to the horizontal to mimic a toe-up well. In addition, different flow conditions were considered to simulate the well production as the reservoir pressure depletes. The existence of severe slugging was evaluated by measuring pressure fluctuations and visual flow observation. Moreover, transient simulations in OLGA were performed to evaluate the possibility of severe slugging in toe-up gas wells. Experimentally, severe slugging was observed for the toe-up configuration and extremely low gas flow rates. Under this condition, significant fluctuations in pressure, gas and liquid flow rates are observed. However, experimental results did not conclude with certainty whether the severe slugging phenomenon can occur in a real gas well.

AB  - ABSTRACT In this study the application of machine learning (ML) and data analytics for monitoring and classifying of slugging behaviour was investigated. Artificial neural networks (ANN) and principal component analysis (PCA) were used for slugging monitoring and for classification. Both methods were tested on simulated data which was generated by a multiphase flow simulator. The results showed that these methods are accurate in monitoring both flow rates and slugging characteristics (amplitude and frequency). Additional insights via PCA-based visualizations show that slugs could be classified based on their frequencies. 1 INTRODUCTION Slugging in wells result in operation issues such as increased average pressure drop, potentially increased sand production, increased loads on topside piping and increased separator control issues which can even lead to separator trips. These large amplitude slugging phenomena are well known from long horizontal flowlines (terrain induced slugging), and from flowline-riser systems (severe slugging). But also in wells these mechanisms can lead to large dynamic disturbances. On top of that, in wells often slugging is induced by area transitions such as at the end-of-tubing and due to system instabilities such as void waves.

AB  - Abstract Dragon Oil operates the Cheleken field in the Caspian Sea offshore Turkmenistan. The production system consists of multiple wellhead and manifold platforms, a complex network of infield carbon steel and flexible flowlines to handle production from HP and LP systems and a 30" × 40 km TL to transport the produced fluids to the CPSF (Central Processing and Storage Facility) located onshore. In addition to the complexities of the flowlines network, the development has a number of unique features that pose challenges to the daily production operation activities such as: -Relatively low reservoir temperatures; -Waxy oil with high WAT (Wax Appearance Temperature) and Pour Point; -Complicated bathymetry of the 30" TL (Trunkline); -Complex reservoirs leading to uncertainty in rates; -Increasing water production; -Increasing sand ingress; -Necessity to commingle water from different sources in the flowlines; -Corrosion, erosion and emulsion occurrence; While management of any of the Flow Assurance issues is well understood on stand-alone basis; there is no definite guidelines to manage them simultaneously through understanding their impact on each other. Obtaining flawless understanding of the nature and extent of each of the impediments issues was a key element for Dragon Oil's team to innovate this approach to minimizing the overall negative impact on production operations. The approach has been developed based on balancing the hydrophobic, hydrophilic and molecular properties of the produced fluids in correlation with the physical criteria of each of the issues to minimize the impact on the others. This paper presents the key elements of a novel approach developed to control the impact of some issues and maintain the deliverability and integrity of the 30" TL. The approach consisted of the following activities: Conducted thorough and rigorous fluids’ analyses; Generated comprehensive operating pressure-temperature envelop during different operational and ambient conditions in the 30" TL; Constructed the occurrence envelops of Flow Assurance issues focusing on wax deposition and severe slugging; Ensured adequacy of slug catching capability at the CPSF and proper procedures to operate; Controlled gas rates to generate severe slugging in the 30" TL; Monitored the performance of the 30" TL (and eventually the system) through close observations to the changes in the key controlling parameters e.g. pressure drop, outcomes of pigging operations and efficiency of separation.

AB  - SummarySevere slugging in multiphase pipelines can cause serious and troublesome operational problems for downstream receiving production facilities. Recent results demonstrating the feasibility and the potential of applying dynamic feedback control to unstable multiphase flow like severe slugging and casing heading have been published.1-5 This paper summarizes our findings on terrain-induced slug flow.5 Results from field tests as well as those from dynamic multiphase flow simulations are presented. The simulations were performed with the pipeline code OLGA2000.*The controllers applied to all of these cases aim to stabilize the flow conditions by applying feedback control rather than coping with slug flow in the downstream processing unit. The results from simulations with feedback control show stable process conditions at both the pipeline inlet and outlet in all cases, whereas without control, severe slug flow is experienced. Pipeline profile plots of the liquid volume fraction through a typical slug flow cycle are compared against corresponding plots with feedback control applied. The comparison is used to justify the internal stability of the pipeline. In many cases, feedback control enables a reduced pipeline inlet pressure, which, again, means an increased production rate.This paper summarizes the experience gained with active feedback control applied to severe slugging. The focus is on extracting similarities and differences between the cases. The main contribution is demonstrating that dynamic feedback control can be a solution to the severe slugging problem.IntroductionMultiphase pipelines connecting remote wellhead platforms and subsea wells are already common in offshore oil production, and there will be even more of them in the years to come. In addition, the proven feasibility of using long-distance tieback pipelines to connect subsea processing units directly to onshore processing plants makes it likely that these will also appear in the future. Such developments are turning the spotlight on one of the biggest challenges for control and operation of offshore processing facilities and subsea separation units - controlling the feed disturbance to the separation process (that is, smoothing or avoiding flow variations at the outlet of multiphase pipelines connecting wells and remote installations to the processing unit).Common forms of flow variations are slug flow in multiphase pipelines and casing heading in gas-lifted oil wells. In both cases, the liquid flows intermittently along the pipe in a concentrated mass called a slug. The unstable behavior of slug flow and casing heading has a negative impact on the operation of offshore production facilities. Severe slugging can even cause platform trips and plant shutdown. More frequently, the large and rapid flow variation causes unwanted flaring and limits the operating capacity in separation and compression units. This reduction is caused by the need for larger operating margins for both separation (to meet the product specifications) and compression (to ensure safe operation with minimum flaring). Backing off the plant's optimal operating in this way reduces its throughput.A lot of effort and money have been spent trying to avoid the operational problems with severe slugging and reduce the effects of the slugs. Roughly speaking, there are three main categories of principles for avoiding or reducing the effects of slugs.Design changes.Operational changes and procedures.Control methods, including feed-forward control, slug choking, and active feedback control.An example of a typical slug-handling technique involving design changes is to install slug catchers (onshore) or increase the size of the first-stage separator(s) to provide the necessary buffer capacity. A different, compact, process-design change is reported in Ref. 6, in which the authors introduce an additional small, pressurized, closed vessel upstream of the first-stage separator to cope with slug flow. An example of operational change is to increase the flowline pressure so that operation of the pipeline/well is outside the slug flow regime.7,8 This is not a viable option for older wells with reduced lifting capacity. For gas-lifted wells, an option would be to increase the gas injection rate (see Ref. 2). These design and operational changes may not be appropriate for already existing installations with slug flow problems or for compact separation units.Control methods for slug handling are characterized by the use of process and/or pipeline information to adjust available degrees of freedom (pipeline chokes, pressure, and levels), reducing or eliminating the effect of slugs in the downstream separation and compression units. The idea of feed-forward control is to detect the buildup of slugs and prepare the separators accordingly to receive them (e.g., via feed-forward control to the separator level and pressure control loops). The aim of slug choking is to avoid overloading the process facilities with liquid or gas. These methods make use of a topside pipeline choke by reducing its opening in the presence of a slug, thereby protecting the downstream equipment. The slug choking may use measurements in the separation unit and/or the output from a slug-detection device/algorithm. For a more complete assessment of the current technology for slug handling, refer to Ref. 9. In this assessment, however, active control methods are not properly addressed.Recently, results have been published that demonstrate the feasibility and potential of applying dynamic feedback control to unstable multiphase flow like severe slugging and casing heading. 1-5 Like slug choking, active feedback control makes use of a topside choke. With dynamic feedback control, however, the approach is to solve the slug problem by stabilizing multiphase flow. Despite the promising results first reported in 1990,1 the use of active slug control on multiphase flow has been limited. To our knowledge, only two installations in operation have stabilizing controllers. These are the Dunbar-Alwyn5,2 and the Hod-Valhall pipelines.5 One reason for this might be that control engineering and fluid flow dynamics usually are separated technical fields (i.e., the control engineers have limited knowledge about multiphase flow and the experts in fluid flow dynamics have limited insights into what can be achieved with feedback control). Indeed, when presenting the results on the Hod-Valhall pipeline,5 we had a hard time convincing several of the fluid-flow-dynamics engineers that one can avoid slug formation in severe slugging by active control. Hence, one objective of this paper is to provide insight and understanding into how feedback control can be used to avoid severe slugging, thereby contributing to bridging the gap between control and petroleum engineering.

AB  - Abstract Deepwater Gulf of Mexico wells that exhibit liquid loading and subsea flowlines that suffer fluid slugging are both common issues that have historically been difficult to mitigate without expensive hardware changes or deferral of production. A novel black oil foamer (BOF) chemical technology has shown to be able to mitigate liquid loading, increase production, and reduce fluid slugging in both dry tree wells, subsea wells, and subsea flowlines. This presentation will detail three example cases where the black oil foamer technology was utilized successfully. For the first example case, liquid loading was the primary issue leading to shortened production time between shut-ins, causing slugging, and reduced overall production rates. For the second example, significant slugging was experienced in an 18-mile subsea tieback to the point that the field would be shut in for topside vessel level controller issues. The final case trialed different well lineups that would historically cause severe slugging in an 11 mile subsea tieback. In the first example, the benefits of using the black oil foamer included increased oil production and greatly improved well uptime, as well as significantly reducing slugging. The benefits demonstrated in the second and third examples were a significant reduction in slugging, allowing the field to operate with minimal shut-in risk and reducing equipment damage. Novel & Additive Information All three examples have proven the concept of using the black oil foamer chemistry to manage liquid loading and slugging risks in deepwater applications in an economically advantageous way.

AB  - Abstract The present work focuses on experimental evidence of slug mitigation via various devices. The slug mitigation potential of a number of mixers was tested using a laboratory scale air/water setup to compare their effect on the incoming slugs just upstream of the separator inlet. Dedicated methods and key performance indicators were developed to characterize the slug properties and evaluate the mixers effectiveness. Such mitigation is especially interesting for the purpose of producing oil and gas from thin oil rims, in which wells are often drilled following the geological structure of the oil-bearing layer. These wells consequently contain many long, near-horizontal sections, through which the transport of the oil gas mixture often takes the form of slug flow, i.e. large volumes of liquid travelling at the velocity of the gas phase. As the gas cannot bypass the slugs, they are generally produced to the topside facilities, where they have a detrimental effect on the mechanical integrity of the equipment and on the metering accuracy due to their large volume. Mitigating slug flow has therefore great potential in optimizing the production from thin-oil rims on the short term. The present study shows that consistent reductions can be obtained on pressure fluctuations due to slugging, highlighting the benefit of these devices. It was observed that the slug speed could be significantly reduced, as well as the liquid hold-up within the slugs, especially when gas lift is used in conjunction with the devices.  The physical mechanisms behind these effects are isolated, leading to optimization of the device geometry, for application to full scale. The demonstrated potential of the mixer devices can yield a quantifiable reduction of the impact of slugging on mechanical integrity and metering accuracy. As a consequence, production limitations due to slugging problems can be alleviated, resulting in potential for increase in oil production rates from thin oil rims. 1.     Introduction With the depletion of conventional resources of oil and gas, more and more difficult resources are being produced, such as thin oil rims. In a thin oil rim, a typical well consists of near-horizontal sections, with upward and downward inclines. In these sections, gravity pulls liquids towards the dips until they block the pipe. Then, the gas, which generally travels at a higher speed than the liquid, can no longer bypass the liquid and pressure will locally increase until it can propel the liquid plug downstream.  Thus, a slug is formed which has the density of the liquid phase and the velocity of the gas phase, which causes its momentum to be very large compared to the homogeneous phase. Slugs may cause all types of problems when they arrive at the topside equipment. The sudden arrival of large volume of liquid in absence of a gas phase can lead to separator overflow and compromise metering accuracy. In addition, the large momentum associated with these slugs can lead to large pressure fluctuations and cause vibrations on process equipment, and problems related to the mechanical integrity of the equipment. Within the scope of this work, three slug classes are distinguished: 1) Backflow – long, slow slugs, which cause strong volume fluctuations at separator and thus metering problems; also sometimes referred to as terrain-induced slugs. As this moniker is not consistently used in literature, the “backflow” label is introduced to avoid confusion. 2) Hydrodynamic – long, fast slugs, which induce strong volume and pressure fluctuations and therefore also may result in compromise of equipment mechanical integrity; 3) Fast wavy – short, fast slugs containing significant amounts of gas. Hence, the fluctuations are less severe than for hydrodynamic slugs, as the slug density is much lower.

AB  - Summary Severe slugging is a transient multiphase-flow phenomenon that can occur in pipeline-riser systems, particularly in offshore production of oil and gas. It is characterized by large pressure fluctuations at the base of the riser and is accompanied by fluctuations in fluid delivery from the top of the riser. This unstable phenomenon is undesirable because production and equipment are affected adversely by the large pressure and flow-rate fluctuations. In this study, air-/water-flow experiments have been carried out at the S-shaped-riser facility in the multiphase-flow laboratory of the Norwegian University of Science and Technology (NTNU) and have been compared with results from a flow simulator (OLGA®). The results obtained in the work show that stability maps, pressure amplitudes, and slug frequencies are in acceptable agreement with each other; however, some deviations are seen regarding the slug frequencies at low flow rates.

AB  - ABSTRACTThis work presents a numerical study on severe slugging and slug mitigation in a pipeline-riser system. Experiment and CFD modelling were performed on the 4” pipeline-riser system with a 55 m long pipeline followed by a 10.5 m high catenary riser at Cranfield University. The CFD model was developed and solved in Fluent. The model predictions of flow regime transition and slug frequency were compared with experimental data and those of OLGA model. The slug movement was described based on the predicted liquid holdup traces at different locations of the system. Slug mitigation methods such as increasing back pressure and choking riser outlet valve were simulated with the CFD model. Satisfactory agreement with the experimental data shows the validity of the proposed model.

AB  - Abstract The effects of horizontal well geometry remain debatable in most production modeling works. Most of recent reports fail to mention the effects of well geometries, especially in severe slugging cases. This study presents a qualitative comparison between different well geometries and their impacts in production performance of horizontal wells. The study utilizes a transient multiphase simulator to mimic the production from a horizontal well over a 12-hour period. The well has a 2-7/8″ ID tubing with TVD of approximately 5000 ft and MD of 10000 ft and maximum inclination angle of 10º within the horizontal section. The trajectories of horizontal section in the well include 5 cases, 5 undulations, hump (one undulation upward), sump (one undulation downward), toe-up and toe-down. These configurations are the representative examples of horizontal wells. A reservoir with a given deliverability equation and several perforation stages is used to provide well inflow. The impacts of reservoir deliverability, GOR, pressure and temperature are studied for all well geometries. The simulation results offer some valuable insights into the effects of well trajectory on production performance, including borehole pressure profile, liquid holdup, gas and liquid rate variations with time, and cumulative gas and liquid production. At high production rates, severe slugging is not observed, and thus, the well geometry effects are minimized with a consistent production at the surface. However, toe-up configuration exhibits a slightly better performance than the others. As the productivity and pressure reduces throughout the life of a well, the impacts of well trajectories become clearer. The presence of severe slugs and blockage of perforations near the toes causes a noticeable drop in production. During severe slugging, the pressure profile reveals longer fluctuation cycles, resulting in extreme separator flooding issues. The slugging frequencies are compared among different well geometries. Toe-down case exhibits lower slugging severity. As a result, toe-down well produces the highest cumulative liquid and gas rates. The presence of liquid blockage is observed in lateral and curvature sections. The toe-up and hump configurations exhibit the most severe slugs with minimum cumulative gas and liquid productions. The differences in productions among well trajectories exceed 30% under different well configurations. With the augmented growth of production from unconventional reservoirs, horizontal well technology has grown in oil and gas industry, yet study of well geometry in production system remains to be limited. This study is a unique effort to optimize well configuration and perforation placement in order to alleviate multiphase flow problems in the wellbore. Providing the practical potential on simulation works, this study provides a predictive guidline to connect well geometry selection and production optimization.

AB  - ABSTRACTTo design and evaluate slugging control strategies, a simulator that is capable to simulate severe slugging accurately with limited CPU-needs is required; therefore a drift flux simulator was developed.The drift-flux simulator was used to simulate a field case. The pressure drop was predicted very well. However, an additional horizontal length was needed in the simulations to obtain slugging. This additional requirement is in-line with known shortcomings of multiphase models identified in literature. Aside this criterion, also a minimum hydraulic jump was required. The current drift-flux simulator is suitable for case specific control strategy development and testing.

AB  - ABSTRACTMultiphase flow characteristics can be altered with the change of pipeline topography in deep offshore oil and gas production. The increase of corrosion rate and decrease of inhibitor performance in the risers can occur due to the change of multiphase flow characteristics (e.g. severe slugging).For the simulation of offshore flow lines and risers, the experiments were carried out in a 44 m long industrial scale multiphase flow loop equipped with three different pipeline inclinations of 0, 3 and 45 degrees. The effectiveness of three commercial corrosion inhibitors were analyzed using 25 cP oil at 20% water cut with three different gas velocities (0.7 m/s, 3 m/s, and 6 m/s). All tests were carried out at a liquid velocity of 1.5 m/s, a system pressure of 6 bar (76 psig) using carbon dioxide gas as the gas phase, and a temperature of 50°C.Also, the effect of inclination on the flow characteristics (e.g. flow pattern) and their subsequent effect on corrosion rates are described. The results indicated that severe pitting corrosion was noticed in the 3 and 45° weight loss coupons for baseline testing. Severe slugging and high slug frequency were seen in 45 degree upward flowing conditions. The tests differentiated between three corrosion inhibitors. In most of testing conditions, high inhibitor concentration was required to achieve the target corrosion rate.

AB  - ABSTRACT The formation of liquid slugs caused by the pipeline profile ("terrain induced slugs1' or "severe slugs") is an important phenomenon to be analyzed during the design stage of systems for the transport of two-phase hydrocarbon mixtures. In this work a mathematical model is developed that generates a necessary condition for the occurrence of severe slugs and an analytical. expression to calculate their length. 1. INTRODUCTIONWhen slug flow" is present in a pipeline transporting two-phase hydrocarbon mixtures', the slugs length and velocity must be calculated in order to size the slug-catcher at the line outlet. The "normal slugs" (caused by flow conditions along an infinite pipeline, with constant slope and physical properties) may be described by mathematical models and semi-empirical correlations usually developed on the basis of laboratory scale data [l], [2]. These correlations may not fit the data for large pipes. A major difficulty exists in describing terrain induced slugs which are caused by downward inclined pipe segments followed by upward segments. These slugs are called "severe" because their length can be much greater than the length of normal slugs. The severe slugs generation process is described: if a dip is present along a pipeline, and the flow in the downward inclined pipe is stratified, then the liquid level in the dip grows up until gas flow blockage is attained. Consequently the trapped gas pressure and the liquid levels in both pipes (descending and ascending) will increase. This trend continues if the increase in pressure of trapped gas is less than the increase in hydrostatic head caused by the liquid column growing up in the upward inclined pipe. When liquid arrives at the top of this pipe the slug growth ends and it is pushed and accelerated along the line. While passing the top, the slug tail loses some liquid (fall-back). During the subsequent descent the slug may break into shorter slugs or join slower ones. The complexity of severe slugs dynamics further increases when a lot of dips are present along the pipeline. The problem can be studied quantitatively by means of very expensive computer codes based on the latest correlations [ 3 ] . Anyway severe slugging can exist only if specific geometrical and physical conditions are present in a pipeline. In most cases of engineering interest, these conditions are not verified. In this paper a "point model" developed by Schmidt [4] is re-formulated. A condition for the onset of severe slugging is obtained and the length of the severe slug is analytically determined. The above mentioned condition, which was already proposed by Boe [ 5 ] # can be utilized during the pipeline design stage to exclude the onset of severe slugging along the line and to study this phenomenon at the outlet terminal. In fact, many pipelines, especially those off-shore, end in a riser pipe that makes the onset of severe slugging moreprobable.

AB  - Summary This article presents a novel approach to estimating severe riser slug buildup time and, consequently, the slug period. The slug model is based on a simplified mechanical model. An explicit estimate of the slug buildup time is presented. The simplified slug model has subsequently been used to illustrate the effects of the traditional actions to prevent severe riser slugging. The slug model is subsequently tested against field data from an offshore floating production platform and large-scale experimental data, as well as data from the literature. The experimental setup is described in detail. The estimate on the slug buildup time provided by the simplified model matches well the experimental data, the field data, and data from relevant references.IntroductionThis article presents a method for estimating the buildup time for riser slugging and, consequently, the slug period. The developed model is subsequently used to explain the effect of traditional measures used to prevent riser slugging. The method presented is useful for identifying new methods and explaining how and why these methods work. Riser slugging, also called severe slugging, is a phenomenon characterized as a low-rate (relative to the dimension of the riser) phenomenon. Severe slugging may therefore occur during startup and tail production of a field. Severe riser slugging is also experienced during startup of flowlines after temporary shutdowns of wells, when the wells are routed one by one to the flowline. This problem is frequently experienced on floating production platforms (FPO) with satellite wells tied to the FPO though marine risers in a lazy S or a similar configuration. Fig. 1 contains a plot of a time series of severe riser slugs occurring during startup of one flowline to the Troll C FPO operating west of Bergen, Norway. Severe riser slugging may cause damage to the first-stage separator internals because of the impulse energy in the liquid slug. Reduced efficiency of the separation in the first-stage separator and fluctuations in the rest of the oil/water treatment plant are other undesired effects from severe riser slugs. Slugging may also cause flaring, which is not environmentally benign and is also costly. This is particularly true in areas where a CO2 gas tax regime is enforced.This article uses a simplified mechanistic model to predict severe slug buildup time. The use of simplified mechanistic models to model two-phase flow is a well proven technique. Taitel and Barnea1 contains a simplified mechanistic two-phase model for slug flow. Various correlations are used to calculate the friction components. A transient simulator is then developed in Taitel and Barnea2 based on an extended mechanistic model with the momentum equations. Neither of these sources contains explicit expressions for the slug buildup time. Schmidt et al.3 contains a simplified mechanical model based on a set of differential equations. The model uses correlation data to model liquid fallback and holdup. Estimates for the slug buildup time are then achieved by integrating the equations with respect to time; therefore, no explicit expression is used to predict the buildup time. In a recent article,4 a steady-state mechanistic model is developed to predict the effect of riser base gas injection to prevent severe slugging. Because the reference contains a steady-state model, no slug buildup time estimate is provided. The simplified two-phase flow model in Taitel 1 is the starting point for this article.Alternative Slug-Control Mechanisms.Several methods are used to avoid or reduce the effect of riser-based slugging. A common way is to use riser-based gas lift. The gas injected at the bottom of the riser increases the superficial gas velocity and reduces the pressure at the riser bottom; thus, the flow is forced outside the slug regime. Increasing the pressure in the line by reducing the opening of the platform choke is also a common measure. This may, for some wells, have the downside that the increased wellhead pressure reduces the production. A different method is to install a slug catcher. A slug catcher is a large drum with volume large enough to contain the liquid and gas from one slug. The gas and liquid is then transferred separately to the first-stage separator. This method is rarely used on offshore installations because of the extra cost related to the space and weight of the slug catcher drum. The S3 slug suppression system5 is a system that combines the principle of a slug catcher with active control. This system uses a small drum that acts like a mini-separator that crudely separates the gas and the liquid. The pressure and the liquid level are automatically controlled, and the gas and liquid flow separately to the first-stage separator in a controlled manner. Active suppression of severe riser slugs by automatic control of the platform production valves is a relatively new approach. Feedback may be taken from the choke position and the riser bottom pressure. One of the first references addressing the issue of automatic control of terrain slugging is in Ref. 6. Recent developments related to automatic control of slugging in wells7 and pipelines8-11 are related, but not similar, phenomena. Ref. 12 contains more experimental results from these experiments and a full-scale implementation on the Heidrun tension leg platform located in the North Sea. These references also contain experimental results from different control structures, including cascade-type controllers with feedback from other states (i.e., feedback from riser top pressure, manifold pressure, and density measured at the riser top).The mathematical model developed in this article is useful for explaining why and how the traditional methods for slug suppression work. Included in this article are both field data and results from large-scale experiments. The next section will analyze the severe riser slug phenomena with a pure mechanistic approach. The final result from this section is an estimate of the slug buildup time and, consequently, the slug period. The following section contains the analysis of why and how riser-based gas lift and adjustment of the platform-based production choke works, while the subsequent two sections present the experimental setup and results. The last two sections contain a field description and field data.

AB  - AbstractRecently, exploitation of offshore petroleum reservoirs has moved to ever increasing water depths. Production from fields in water deeper than 1800 m is now a reality. The use of long deep-water risers that conduct production from multiple wellheads on the sea floor to the surface predisposes the system to severe slugging in the riser for a wide range of flow rates and seabed topography. Considering the length of the deep-water risers, the problem is expected to be more severe than in production systems installed in shallower waters. Severe slugging could occur at high pressure, with the magnitude of the pressure fluctuations so large as to cause a shorter natural flow period with subsequent consequences such as premature field abandonment, loss of recoverable reserves and earlier-than-planned deployment of boosting devices.In this study, a novel idea to lessen or eliminate severe slugging in pipeline-riser systems has been investigated. The principle of the technique is to transfer the pipeline gas to the riser at a point above the riser-base. The transfer process will reduce both the hydrostatic head in the riser and the pressure in the pipeline, consequently lessening or eliminating the severe slugging by maintaining the steady-state two-phase flow in the riser.In this paper a steady state model is presented. It can be used as a design tool for the self-lifting concept by determining the operation envelope for successful self-lift operation given the location of the gas takeoff or injection points; it can predict the acceptable range of pressure losses in the gas bypass for continuous steady-state operation of the self-gas-lift system. The model was found to perform very well when compared to the acquired experimental data.IntroductionSevere slugging can occur in two-phase flow systems where a pipeline segment with a downward inclination angle is followed by another segment/riser with an upward inclination angle. For such a system, at relatively low gas and liquid flow rates, liquid can accumulate at the riser base, blocking the gas flow. This will consequently result in an increasing liquid level in the riser until the liquid reaches the riser top. Simultaneously, gas in the downward inclined section will be compressed. When the gas pressure in the pipeline has increased enough to counter the hydrostatic head of the liquid column, the gas will expand and push the liquid column violently out of the riser into the separator. Severe slugging will cause periods of no liquid and gas production in the separator followed by very high liquid and gas flow rates. The resulting large pressure and flow rate fluctuations are highly undesirable; sudden surges in liquid production could cause overflow and shut down of the separator. Fluctuations in gas production could result in operational and safety problems during flaring, and the high pressure fluctuations could impact negatively on the field's production performance, and ultimately lead to a reduction in recoverable reserves.Currently, there are three basic elimination methods that have been proposed, namely, backpressure increase, gas lift, and choking. All other proposed techniques are based on these three elimination methods.The backpressure increase method eliminates severe slugging by increasing the system pressure, and thereby significantly reducing the production capacity.In gas lifting, external gas is injected either into the riser or pipeline at the riser bottom to reduce the hydrostatic head in the riser or increase the gas flow rate in the pipeline. Gas-Lift equipment requires a large footprint on the platform and large amounts of gas to accomplish the elimination. The operational cost of gas lifting can be very significant.Choking increases the backpressure in proportion to the velocity increase in the riser. If the movement of the gas in the riser is stabilized before reaching the choke, steady flow will occur after a short flow period. The stabilization requires very careful choking to ensure minimum backpressure.

AB  - Optimizing the development of oil and gas fields necessitates the use of accurate predication techniques. The predictions should also involve minimizing the uncertainties associated with day-to-day operational challenges related to wells, pipelines and surface facilities. The choke size settings, for instance, need to be frequently adjusted to optimize production flowrates using the right techniques. This paper provides a method to optimize the production flowrate for existing wells and to minimize the cost through finding the best cost-effective selection. Providing an insight into factors affecting the flow assurance of oil and gas reservoirs is also included. The study has been implemented by the use of nodal analysis conducted by a surface network simulation, to reach the optimum design of oil and gas production systems. The optimization of the wells can be achieved by changing tubing and flowline sizes, minimizing the skin factor, controlling the water cut, and adjusting the gas-lift injection pressure. The Hurricane oil field that covers a wide range of subsurface and surface facility data is simulated in this paper. Seven reservoirs are considered in this study containing eleven different wells. Seven of these wells are producing naturally while the remaining four wells are gas-lifted. For each of the eleven wells, different parametric scenarios are run on the different size of the pipelines and chokes. Flow assurance study has been conducted to know the effect of severe slugging, wax deposition, and hydrate formation. Severe slugging has been predicted using a surface network simulation, while wax deposition and hydrate formation using a pressure-volume- temperature (PVT) simulation. For the artificial lift wells, as this field was mainly operated by gas lift, a new design has been implemented based on gas surface injection rate as a way to eliminate the workover operations.

AB  - Abstract Severe slug flow (i.e., terrain-dominated slug flow) was studied in a simulated offshore pipeline riser-pipe system. Severe slug flow is characterized by extremely long liquid slugs generated at the base of the vertical riser. This phenomenon occurs at low gas and liquid flow rates and for negative pipeline inclinations. Slugging in some offshore platforms has required the use of operating procedures that drastically curtail production. Losses in flow capacity up to 50% have been reported. production. Losses in flow capacity up to 50% have been reported. A hydrodynamic model has been developed for severe slug flow. The model's predictions agree with experimental data. The model can be used to design predictions agree with experimental data. The model can be used to design new pipeline riser-pipe systems or to adjust the operation of existing systems to prevent the occurrence of severe slug flow. Also, a flow-regime map is presented for predicting the severe slug flow regime, where the boundaries are determined analytically. Finally, additional methods are proposed to prevent the flooding of separation facilities by riser-pipe proposed to prevent the flooding of separation facilities by riser-pipe generated slugs. This study is an extension of Ref. 1, in which severe slug flow was introduced and was only partially modeled. Introduction Two-phase flow in pipelines frequently involves the formation of liquid slugs. Processing of these slugs with separators can be extremely difficult if the size of the slugs becomes abnormally long. When a long liquid slug reaches a separator, it is possible for the liquid level in the separator to rise faster than the separator can purge the liquid, resulting in possible liquid carry-over into the gas stream. A technique often used for possible liquid carry-over into the gas stream. A technique often used for protecting separators from liquid slugs is to install an additional vessel protecting separators from liquid slugs is to install an additional vessel ahead of the separator, which usually is called a "slug catcher." The combined cost of the two smaller vessels is usually lower than the cost of a single large separator, which must be designed to process liquid slugs. However, the size of the slug catcher and/or separator must increase with increasing expected liquid slug sizes. The cost of installation of large separators and slug catchers, especially in the hostile environments found in Alaska, in swamps, or on offshore platforms, may be prohibitive. Therefore, it is desirable to have a technique that can predict and control both the occurrence and magnitude of liquid slugs so that separation facilities can be designed properly and their size decreased. Recently, studies have been performed that have increased dramatically the accuracy of both slug size and frequency predictions. Earlier studies, performed under laboratory conditions, indicated that slug lengths would performed under laboratory conditions, indicated that slug lengths would be no more than 100 ft [30.48 m]. However, recent studies performed on full-scale pipelines have indicated that slug lengths of more than 2,000 ft [609.6 m] are possible. In addition, it has been discovered that slug flow can be generated by several different mechanisms, each producing liquid slugs with different physical properties. Schmidt et al., in studying slug flow in a simulated offshore pipeline riser-pipe system, found two distinct slug flow patterns: normal (e.g., hydrodynamic) and severe (e.g., terrain-dominated) slug flow. Severe slug flow is characterized by the generation of liquid slugs at the base of the riser pipe, with the remainder of the pipeline in stratified flow. Normal slug flow is characterized by many liquid slugs being generated along the length of the pipeline and occurs at higher gas and liquid flow rates. The liquid slugs generated during severe slug flow were found to range in length from one to several riser-pipe heights, which, at the time this study was performed, generally exceeded the slug lengths associated with normal slug flow. Therefore, riser-pipe-generated slug flow was designated "severe" slug flow, in comparison to "normal" pipeline-generated slug flow. Severe slug flow was found to depend on the geometry of the pipeline riser-pipe system. The pipeline must be in stratified flow, as well as inclined negatively for the liquid slug to be generated at the base of the riser. Also, because of the mechanism by which severe slugs are generated, it was found that the degree of slug aeration for severe slugs was much lower than that associated with normal slug flow. Also, the study showed that the phenomena of severe and normal slug flow are mutually exclusive because normal pipeline slugs and bubbles will flow through the riser pipe nearly unchanged, excluding the possibility of a riser-generated slug. Finally, a hydrodynamic model was developed for severe slug flow. The model was formulated on basic physical principles and was limited to a description of how the liquid slug is generated at the base of the riser pipe. No attempt was made to model the full behavior of the severe slug pipe. No attempt was made to model the full behavior of the severe slug flow cycle. Bendiksen et al. developed a dynamic one-dimensional two-phase flow model for the Norwegian state oil company, Statoil. They gave the mass and momentum conservation equations for each phase, and solved them numerically by using finite difference techniques. SPEJ P. 27

AB  - AbstractIn offshore oilfield development projects using subsea tiebacks, severe riser slugging is of great concern, particularly for flowlines with downward slope at the riser base. In a recent conceptual design for a deepwater field, the flowline system consisted of a downward pipeline about 2,100m long and a steel catenary riser in 700-m deep water. Transient flow analysis indicated that severe riser slugging would occur. The paper describes the analysis of several mitigation techniques - increasing well lift-gas injection rate, injecting lift-gas at riser base and reducing riser diameter.The study revealed that these severe slug mitigation techniques reduced the slug volume and frequency with different efficiencies. For the particular case study, increasing the lift gas at wellbore bottom of 1 MMSCFD from the base case of 3 MMSCFD was the most efficient technique to eliminate severe slugging. Riser base gas lift required 3 MMSCFD in addition to the 3 MMSCFD lift gas at the bottom of wellbore. Mitigation by reducing riser diameter was not effective because it required a 2" reduction in the diameter and would make flowline pigging difficult. The analysis also showed that including the wellbore in transient flow models for the short-distance flowlines is essential. Without the wellbore model, no severe riser slugging was predicted.IntroductionSubsea tieback has been increasingly used in the development of deepwater oil and gas fields. In a typical subsea production system, produced fluids flow through a wellbore, a subsea flowline and a riser. Flow patterns in the production flowlines and risers may be in stratified flow, slug flow, or annular flow. A flow regime of particular concern and may cause the most damage to topsides equipment is the severe riser slugging. Severe riser slugging occurs when liquid accumulates at the riser base and totally fill a section of the flowline and riser for an extended period of time under some flow conditions, especially when there is a downward slope in the flowline at the riser base and the flowrate is low. During this period of time, gas accumulates behind the liquid section and its pressure increases. When the pressure is high enough, the liquid columns is blown out of the riser at high velocity and as a long slug. The slug will impose large impact forces on the elbows, chokes and closed valves in the riser system, and also may flood the topside separators.To avoid the large pressure surge and the liquid flowrate surge in severe slugging, production strategy should be optimized so that the operations are outside the slugging producing regions. The flow stability and the remediation methods should be studied for each subsea development.This paper describes a case study for a subsea manifolded production system in which severe slugging will occur in the late life of the field development. The slug mitigation techniques investigated were increasing gas-lift rate, reducing riser diameter, injecting gas at the riser base in addition to the wellbore gas lift, and choking at topside before separator.System descriptionThe reservoir is produced by three production wells. Figure 1 shows the development concept. Dual flowlines are used to tie back a subsea manifold to a FPSO. The two proposed flowline diameters are 6-inch ID, each with a 6-inch ID catenary riser, determined by the maximum flowrates for these wells. The dual flowlines design is used to facilitate testing and pigging operations. One well production flows in the first line and two-well production flows in the other flowline. The following section introduces the production pipeline and the riser profile, the fluid property and the production data.Flowline and riser profilesA FPSO is located at 700-m deep water and the wellhead is 2500 m away from the FPSO in 600-m deep water. A typical well has a MD of 4307 m and TVD of 2784 m.The gas injection point is 2907 m MD. The well tubing is 5.5" (4.892"ID).Figure 2 shows the pipeline and riser profiles.

AB  - Abstract Severe slugging may occur at low flowrate conditions when a downward inclined pipeline is followed by a vertical riser. This phenomenon is undesirable for offshore oil and gas production due to large pressure and flowrate fluctuations. It is of great technological relevance to develop reliable and economical means of severe slugging mitigation. This study aims to develop an automated control system to detect and mitigate the formation of severe slugging through a choke valve and a series of sensors. As a first step, an overall flow map is generated to indicate the region within which severe slugging may occur based on Boe's criterion [1] and Taitel's model [2, 3]. It was possible to obtain different flow patterns by controlling the rate of water and gas injection. The aim of this paper is, however, the formation of severe slugs and study of mitigation techniques. In the control part, we used a choke valve controlled by software which is in feedback with data from a system with pressure, temperature, flow, which are able to measure even small changes in the relevant parameters to the model. A two-phase flow loop was built for the study of severe slugging in pipeline-riser system with air and water as work fluids. The inner diameter of riser and flowline is 76.2 mm. The riser is 20 meters high and the flowline is 15 meters long and could be inclined upward or downward up to 8-degree. It has been shown by experiments how riser slugging can be controlled by automated control system. Introduction The multiphase flow occurs in many processes in the oil industry, in the production and transportation, wells and the links between these and platforms. Several studies have been undertaken in order to predict their behavior as this has a large effect on the productivity and safety of equipment [4, 5]. The flow of gas and liquid simultaneously have various types of configurations or patterns, depending on the operating variables, speed, fluid pressure, pipe diameter and inclination angle. It is known that the equations that predict the behavior of fluids vary considerably according to the type of flow. Among the flow patterns the intermittent was the object of study of this project. According to the literature the intermittent flow can be subdivided into plug flow and slug flow. The plug flow occurs in general for low flow rates and bubble are free flowing inside the liquid. At high flow rates of gas bubbles have small size as the fluid was aerated. The slug flow may also be divided into two types, the hydrodynamic and severe. The hydrodynamic slug can form in horizontal sections or wells and risers. The severe intermittence or slug occurs from the accumulation of fluid in the sections downhill by gravitational effect. This phenomenon can occur in pipeline-riser systems which the pipeline is downhill and soon rises to the riser. At low flow rates of liquid and gas, due to the accumulation of fluid in the riser blocking the passage of gas, resulting in its compression. When the gas pressure exceeds the hydrodynamic pressure of the fluid in the riser, the gas arises expanding and pushing the fluid in the column to the separator. This phenomenon results in periods without production followed by a large amount of liquid and gas as well as sudden changes in pressure. Slug, therefore is the formation of large gas bubbles in a flow regime that occurs within the multiphase pipeline transportation and production of hydrocarbons. Characterized by large variations in flow and pressure occurring in the whole process of production and transportation. The slugs generate undesirable consequences in the process of oil production, such as no oil periods, followed by high oil production within the separator. The reduction in production capacity, emergency stop on the platform due to the high liquid level in the separator, corrosion and wear to the process equipment and high maintenance costs are some consequences of this phenomenon.

AB  - Abstract In mature fields, pipelines are often oversized for their operating conditions. This is because their design was primarily based on the early and plateau production and less on late life production. This oversizing may lead to slugging issues, whereby flow fluctuations cause liquid handling problems in the receiving facilities, which can lead to system trips. The purpose of this paper is to describe the workflow, which includes identifying the operational problems, designing the slug control system, and commissioning and monitoring of the control system. The Smart Choke developed by Shell1 is able to mitigate the effects of slugs and has now been installed at several locations worldwide. It is an active slug control system: the topside choke acts only if surges are observed, reducing the peak flow rate into the separator. Between slugs, the choke valve opens, reducing the imposed backpressure. Since flow fluctuations are reduced, operation is again possible without risking excessive separator liquid levels. The workflow consists of the following steps: (i) If slugging leads to production deferment or to operational problems, a feasibility study is done to assess the benefits of installing a Smart Choke. To this end, the key design and production data are collected in a single data sheet that is analyzed by flow assurance experts, (ii) The analysis may include using dynamic multiphase flow models. The models are used to reproduce the slugging behaviour as seen in the field and to assess the adequacy of the Smart Choke. (iii) If the results indicate a positive outlook, and the asset agrees, the implementation needs to be planned and executed. This requires further data gathering on the choke actuator, the pipework for a suitable transducer location, and the platform control system. (iv) The flow assurance and process control experts go to the platform to help commissioning the Smart Choke, which includes tuning of the controller parameters. (v) Once in operation the Smart Choke performance is monitored remotely by the experts using PI Process Book. In addition to pipeline systems already in operation, implementation of a Smart Choke can also be considered for pipeline projects in the development phase. When in the hydraulic assessment risks are identified with respect to slugging, the decision for full implementation can be postponed, but the production system is made "Smart Choke ready" by reservation of weight/space at a pipe segment at the outlet of the pipeline upstream of the separator. When slugging occurs in a later phase of the field life the spool piece can be replaced by the required Smart Choke hardware without doing any hot work.

AB  - ABSTRACTThe “slug capturing” method developed by Issa & co-workers is based on the numerical solution of the two-fluid model equations using fine meshes (unlike existing methods employing much coarser ones) to enable the resolution of inherent flow instabilities that would otherwise be averaged out. The method had been extensively validated in the past against laboratory experimental data for hydrodynamic slugging. Here, more validations are presented both for hydrodynamic and severe slugging and the results are compared against independent experimental measurements. It is then applied to a real 20 inch diameter, 15 km long oil and gas pipeline operating at a pressure of 96 bar to simulate the initiation of hydrodynamic waves/slugs and their complex interaction with terrain undulations in the pipeline.

AB  - Elaborated models, such as those used for simulation purposes [e.g., in the OLGA® simulator (Bendiksen et al. 1991)], cannot be used for model-based control design because these models use too many state variables and the model equations are not usually available for the user. The focus of this paper is on deriving simple, dynamical models with few state variables that capture the essential dynamic behavior for control. We propose a new simplified dynamic model for severe-slugging flow in pipeline/riser systems. The proposed model, together with five other simplified models found in the literature, are compared with results from the OLGA simulator. The new model can be extended to other cases, and we consider also a well/pipeline/riser system. The proposed simple models are able to represent the main dynamics of severe-slugging flow and compare well with experiments and OLGA simulations.

AB  - Abstract The ConocoPhillips Alpine facility, on the Alaskan North Slope, has experienced slugging problems severe enough to trip the high-high inlet separator level, causing frequent plant shutdowns, and loss of production of 110 kbbl/d.  A slugging study was commissioned to investigate the cause of the existing CD-2 pipeline slugging, and possible mitigation procedures, which could alleviate and/or eliminate slugging.  Further, the Alpine expansion called for an additional two pipelines (CD-3 and CD-4) to be brought into Alpine inlet separator.  Slugging mechanism and instability analysis were performed. The instability is due to combination of its low flow rate, overly-sized pipeline ID and unfavorable pipeline profile.  Flow pattern transition exists at the low spots and liquid accumulates and blocks the flow. In the low pressure system, once gas blows out and system pressure drops, the pipeline inlet gas increases velocity and picks up a new hydrodynamic slug.  This slug moves through the road crossing and the pipe rack riser, becoming a long slug which arrives at the separator. In this study, a slug-tracking model with separator gas/liquid PID controllers was built to reproduce the field SCADA data.  A remarkably good match of pressure variations, slugging frequency and liquid level was achieved.  A sensitivity study was performed to investigate the effective and practical ways to suppress slugging in the existing CD-1 and CD-2 pipeline.  Finally, a combined control was recommended by installing a by-pass control valve at the butterfly valve location.  The by-pass inlet control valve before the separator acquires separator liquid level signal, and actuates when the separator liquid level exceeds the set value.  This significantly reduces slugging effect on separator performance. The slugging model and results based on the existing CD-2 pipeline were applied to the future expanded CD-3 and CD-4 pipeline study.  Some conclusions were drawn from the slugging behavior. Introduction In many oil and gas developments with multiphase flowlines, production instability due to slugging is a major flow assurance concern. Slugging initiates oscillations, puts excessive demands upon the separation and operation, and increases the wear and tear of equipment.  Large liquid surges can cause poor performance, separator shut down, high pressure trips, or flaring. Slugging can be characterized by periodical change of pressure and gas/liquid flow.  The slugging severity depends on slugging types.  There are three types of slugging: Hydrodynamic slugs: a feature of the slug flow regime where slugs are continuously formed due to instability of waves at certain gas-liquid flow rates. Generally, hydrodynamic slugs do not exceed 20 times of pipe diameters if there is no obvious inclination change.  Operationally induced surges: generated by changing the flow conditions from one steady state to another, such as restart, flow rate ramp-up or pigging operations.  The generated liquid surge can upset the system. Terrain induced slugs: also called severe slugs, caused by accumulation and periodic purging of liquid in flowline dips at low flow rates;

AB  - ABSTRACTIn this study, characteristics of sever slugging was investigated in a two-phase flowloop which is composed of downwardly inclined pipe and vertical riser. A globe type valve was installed at the upper part of the vertical riser to control the flow rate and the gas was injected through the injection points in the horizontal section. When changing the gas-liquid ratio at the gas injection point, different type of slugging was observed, such as severe slugging, oscillation, and combination of both, were observed at the boundary between slugging and stable condition. Based on the observation, the stability map for the flowloop was developed to provide flow patterns under different ranges of superficial velocity of liquid and gas. Moreover, it was observed that when injecting gas at the point downstream of the liquid pump, the pressure of the flowloop showed a flow regime of dual frequency severe slugging, which is a combination of high frequency fluctuation and low frequency oscillation. When injecting gas through the other two points, only severe slugging fluctuation was observed, however the slug growth pattern was different depending on the superficial liquid velocity. OLGA, a multiphase flow simulation software, was used to model the obtained experimental results. The simulation results showed the deviation for the amplitude of gas tank pressure was within 5% and the deviation for the period was within 10% under severe slugging formation. The model was further developed to predict the pressure changes under different severe slugging types including the dual frequency severe slugging.INTRODUCTIONGas-liquid two-phase flows are frequently observed form many kinds of industries. In the offshore oil and gas production field, gas-liquid two-phase flows occur during transportation of produced oil and gas (Shoham, 2006). Hydrocarbon components exist in reservoir as either gas or liquid phase depending on the pressure and temperature conditions. That makes the transportation of hydrocarbons from reservoir multi-phase. These two phase flows from the reservoir may induce operation issues, and one of them is unstable flow due to the geometry of pipeline. Unstable fluid flow may occur when two-phase fluid passes through a vertical riser connected to a downwardly inclined subsea flowline, as was in a pipeline laid in a hilly terrain (Taitel, 1986). This has been called severe slugging or terrain induced slugging. As it passes through the vertical riser, liquid accumulates at the bottom of the riser and begins to block the passage through which the gas phase can pass, as showed in figure 1 (1). The second step, figure 1 (2), is the compression of the gas until it is pressurized to push the liquid accumulation at the bottom of the vertical riser. When the pressure build-up upstream of the liquid accumulation is high enough to push the gravitational head of the liquid, the accumulated liquid will come out from the vertical riser quickly, which is the third and fourth step in figure 1 (3) and (4). The final step is the gas blowdown and the liquid accumulation would occur again at the bottom of the riser, figure 1 (5). When the severe slugging occurs, these five steps will be repeated periodically. Understanding of severe slugging is essential when designing the offshore platform because the liquid level of the separator may suddenly increase or vortex induced vibration (VIV) may appear in the riser.

AB  - Abstract The objectives of this research are: to analyze the effects of the catenary shape during the occurrence of severe slugging and to develop a simplified but accurate mathematical model to calculate the main parameters of severe slugging in a flowline - catenary riser system. Offshore exploration is achieving new records of ultra deep water petroleum production in subsea oil fields with multiple production wells at different flow rates, multiphase flow, high pressure gradients, and a wide range of flowlines and risers systems spread over the irregular seabed topography, which can lead to the occurrence of severe slugging. Severe slugging is an undesirable phenomenon. Catenary riser is the most used geometry in the Brazilian offshore deepwater production scenario, and the catenary shape influence over the severe slugging is unknown. The proposed model, which is based on Taitel´s model (1986), has been modified in order to take into consideration the geometric configuration of the riser in catenary. Therefore, new formulations for the residual liquid fallback have also been proposed and incorporated in the original models for the vertical riser. The developed model has been validated with experimental data of three test cases: being the first one of a vertical riser with 38.1m of length (case 1), the second one of a group of nine combinations of superficial speed of gas and liquid obtained from a catenary riser system with 9.886m height (case 2), and finally the third one being a real offshore system in production of a flowline-riser in catenary, operating in a water depth of 1,250m (case 3). The obtained conclusion is that the catenary riser geometry has direct influence over the severe slugging cycle, the slug formation pressure, the liquid level inside the system, and the liquid fallback. It was also possible to verify the severe slugging cycle model sensibility to the top side riser angle, separator pressure, riser height, and liquid and gas superficial velocities. Based on the comparison between the simulation results and the experimental data, it could be concluded that the proposed modified model for the flowline-riser system in catenary may be applied on the simulation of severe slugging with rather accurate precision.

AB  - ABSTRACTSevere slugging can exist in many subsea flow lines that can upset topsides facilities. There are several techniques to control the severe slugging. Most of these techniques result in pressure increase at the topside reducing the production.In this paper, a new passive technique is presented to eliminate the severe slugging. The new technique requires a flow line consisting of various consecutive upward and downward segments that help better mixing of the gas and liquid phases. This configuration does not contain any diameter reductions, and thus would allow pigging operation. The method may potentially reduce or eliminate terrain-induced severe slugging in subsea risers, allow higher production rates without choking and provide a potential solution to deepwater fields which are starting to experience severe slugging.The commercial dynamic multiphase pipeline simulator OLGA® showed terrain slugging elimination with the presented method. Pilot scale trial of this method was successfully performed at the severe slugging facility of the University of Tulsa. In this paper, the experimental results and OLGA® predictions will be presented.

AB  - Summary The drift-flux model is applied to simulate numerically highly transient slug flows in complex configurations. The study is focused on the terrain-induced slugging phenomenon. Previously published transient experimental data on multiphase flows in complex configurations with near-horizontal segments are closely investigated. The numerical implementation of the drift-flux model is briefly described. By varying the specific tuning parameters of the drift velocity, a close match with the transient experimental data for air/water flows is obtained. To verify the quality of the numerical solution and agreement with experimental data, the problem-specific criteria are introduced. These criteria are the time of the first slug arrival, average amplitude of slugs, average period between the slugs, average cumulative liquid production per slug, and total produced mass over the observation period. The model developed was used to predict severe slugging for the synthetic case involving the flow of hydrocarbon oil and gas and is representative of the realistic field-scale problem. The possible ways of further improving the drift-flux model and its potential practical applications are outlined.

AB  - AbstractA maturing BP oilfield called Wytch Farm has recently experienced operating problems with its ESP wells. Large fluctuations had been seen in flowrate, pressure and supply current. The fluctuations were recorded for several different flowrates, before being analysed. The analysis of the data gave a suspicion that these wells were slugging in the wellbore before the pump inlet. However only oil and water are known to exist in the wellbore in this particular field and this type of behaviour had never been seen before in this oilfield.Discussion about the mechanisms of oil-water slugging, and also why these wells have recently started to slug are included.Transient analysis of the well using OLGA (ref 1.) gave a good representation of the wellbore and a degree of confidence that we could predict the flow pattern. Further analysis led to a better understanding of the mechanisms Causing these operational issues. The end result is that recommendations can be made for future wells and indeed the same analysis is recommended before they are completed to avoid this unusual problem in the future.P. 461

AB  - ABSTRACTFor multiphase flows in offshore pipelines, severe slugging could lead to serious consequences, e.g. reduction in production, damages of facilities, and pollutions to environment. In order to predict slugging behaviours and to eliminate its occurrence, it is desired to have a reliable mathematical model to simulate the slugging behaviour. However, it is also challenging to model severe slugging in risers with diverse geometries. A one-dimensional, isothermal and quasi-equilibrium model is developed based on the severe slugging mechanism and verified with experiment data. Riser geometric structure, pipeline diameter and riser height and boundary conditions have been inserted into the model to analyze the impact on the severe slugging characteristics, which make the model more generic and reliable.

AB  - Summary. Severe slugging in pipeline/riser systems was modeled by solving the local instantaneous equations for mass and momentum with a method of characteristics. The results are in good agreement with experimental data obtained in a 0.053-m-diameter flow loop for different pipeline slopes and various flow rates. IntroductionThe unstable behavior of two-phase flow in pipe systems is encountered frequently in oil production. Examples are the casing heading that occurs in oil wells working at low gas and oil flow rates, the annulus heading of some gas-lift wells, and severe slugging in pipeline/riser systems. Such situations correspond to large-amplitude, long-duration instabilities, which may reduce oil production and damage installations. These large-scale instabilities result from the competition between restoring forces owing to gravity and lift forces linked to gas flow. They have to be distinguished from the small-scale instabilities of the flow itself that arise, for example, in conventional slug flow. Because they probably have the same origin, however, large-scale instabilities are prevented by similar means. This paper focuses on the severe-slugging phenomenon, although the model proposed was also used for annulus heading. Schmidt et al. described a typical unstable periodic cycle (Fig. 1). The first step, slug generation, corresponds to an increase of the pressure in the bottom of the riser. The liquid level does not reach the top of the riser. During this period, the liquid is no longer sup-ported by the gas and begins to fall. As the pressure increases, the gas accumulates in the pipeline, so the riser is supplied by liquid and eventually gas at a lower rate. In the second period, the liquid level is again built up by liquid entering from the bottom of the pipeline. Note that a negative slope is not required to explain this step. For downward flow, a liquid slug is formed at the bottom, so the rise in the liquid level results from liquid flowing alone in the riser. For horizontal flow, the fallback phenomenon does occur, and the rise in liquid level may result from a poor gaseous mixture flowing in the riser. During the second step, slug production, the liquid level reaches the riser outlet, and the liquid slug eventually formed at the bottom of the pipeline is produced until the gas again supplies the riser. This step does not exist for horizontal pipes. In the third step, bubble penetration, gas is again supplied to the riser, so the hydrostatic pressure decreases. As a result, the gas flow rate increases. The fourth step corresponds to "gas blowdown." When the gas produced at the riser bottom reaches the top, the pressure is minimal and the liquid is no longer gas-lifted. The liquid level falls and a new cycle begins. Yocum and Taitel reported on this subject. Schmidt et al., who undertook an extensive investigation of the experimental behavior of pipeline/riser systems, proposed the first model requiring an empirical correlation to calculate liquid fallback. Schmidt et al. later improved the physical model for which four different sets of equations are necessary for slug generation, slug production, bubble penetration, and gas blowdown. Their results are in good agreement for a downward-sloping pipeline. Nevertheless, the model probably cannot adequately cover the full cycle of a horizontal pipe. Pots et al. discussed how to scale a laboratory flow loop to simulate the behavior of a field installation. They mentioned the occurrence of severe slugging with horizontal pipes allow liquid flow rates but suggested flowline undulations as the cause. Taitel's theoretical work dealt with the conditions in which an unstable process occurs and gave solutions for eliminating instability. His study was limited to downward pipe inclination. This paper tries to give a correct physical explanation of flow instability on the basis of experimental investigations and numerical simulations. Long-period instabilities were observed with both downward and horizontal pipes, although with less amplitude in horizontal pipes. A numerical model that solves the same set of equations for the full cycle is proposed. In this first attempt, great care was taken to obtain the right solution for riser behavior from local equations. Only an overall global model was used for the mass balance in the pipe. The solution gives the time variations of the pressures, void fraction, and flow rates, as well as the liquid height in the riser, through the method of characteristics. The predictions are then compared with experimental findings. Experimental Equipment and Procedure To understand the physics of severe slugging, experiments were carried out in a laboratory-scale flow loop made of 0.053-m-ID transparent polyvinyl pipes. The air/water mixture flowed through a 25-m-long horizontal or inclined pipeline and a 13.5-m-long vertical riser (Fig. 2). The pipeline was supported by a pivoting (+/- 8 %) steel frame, and the two pipes were connected through a 0.5-m radius bend. The frame was designed so that bending for a pipe filled with liquid is less than 0.1%. At the pipeline inlet, the fluids were supplied through a Y-junction to prevent disturbances, especially for stratified flow. At the riser outlet, the air/water mixture was separated by gravity in a horizontal vessel working under atmospheric conditions. The separator was designed so that no siphoning occurs between the reservoir and the riser. Water was supplied to the Y-mixer from a pump at a constant flow rate, regardless of the pressure in the pipeline. Air was supplied at a controlled pressure of 500 kPa from a rotary compressor. The gas flow rate was controlled by a manual valve placed close to the mixer and working in a choked condition. The liquid flow rate was measured by a volumetric rotary flowmeter, and a set of three diaphragms covering 0.0005 to 0.1 kg/s was used for the gas flow rate. In both cases, the accuracy was better than +/- 1%. The pipeline was equipped with (1) two strain-gauge pressure transducers mounted in the middle and the outlet of the pipe and (2) three capacitance wires. Instantaneous pressure and liquid height were obtained with an accuracy better than +/-0.5%. In addition, two homemade hot-wire probes were placed in both pipes for flow-pattern recognition. Sixty-eight 30-minute runs, during which the pressures and liquid heights were recorded, were carried out for different gas and liquid flow rates and three different pipe slopes (0, 1, and -1%). The inlet flow conditions are given by the superficial velocity of each phase. For the gas, the velocity is calculated from the mass flow rate using the density at 20 deg. C and 100 kPa.

AB  - SPE Members Abstract Flow instabilities can occur in pipeline-riser systems operating at low liquid and gas rates, leading to an undesirable cyclic operation. Traditional methods for elimination of riser flow instabilities are choking and gas lift. However, each of these methods suffers from operational disadvantages. Choking can increase the back pressure, thereby, reducing production, while gas lift requires large volumes of injected gas. The objective of this paper is to investigate existing methods and to propose a more optimum method for the elimination or minimization riser flow instabilities. An experimental study has been conducted to predict the behavior of the different methods of elimination of riser instabilities. It was found out that a combination of gas lift and choking is an efficient elimination method, reducing both the required degree of choking and the amount of injected gas required to stabilize the flow in the riser. The proposed method is less sensitive to choke setting and injected gas volume, as compared to elimination by either choking or gas lift alone. Additional advantage is the capability of a smooth and controlled start-up of the system. This study demonstrates the usefulness of flow pattern maps as a simple and effective tool for the visualization and prediction of flow occurrence of flow instabilities. Theoretical criteria have therefore been developed to predict the flow behavior for riser base gas lift and riser top choking. Introduction Flow instabilities can occur in a pipeline riser system where a downward inclined or undulating horizontal pipeline is connected to a vertical riser. For such a system, at low liquid and gas rates, liquid can accumulate in the riser and the pipeline, blocking the flow of gas. This results in a compression of the gas in the pipeline. If the liquid buildup in the riser is faster than the pressure increase in the pipeline due to the compression of the gas, the liquid level will continue to rise until the top of the riser is reached. When the gas pressure in the pipeline has increased sufficiently to counter the hydrostatic head of the liquid column, the gas will expand and push the entire liquid column out of the riser and into the separator. causing a blowout. During severe slugging one can experience periods of no liquid and gas production into the separator, followed by very high liquid and gas rates when the liquid slug is being produced. This is undesirable due to the large pressure and flow rate fluctuations it causes. The large liquid production can cause possible overflow and shut down of the separator. Fluctuations in gas production can cause operational problems during flaring, and pressure fluctuations can reduce the production capacity of the field. Severe slugging is by definition the buildup of liquid slugs equal to or longer than one riser height. Severe slugging is normally described as a cyclic phenomena consisting of four phases: 1. slug formation, 2. slug production, 3. blowout, and 4. liquid fall back. However, cyclic riser instability with the buildup of slugs shorter than one riser height can also occur, but these are normally of a less severe nature. P. 195^

AB  - Summary Even at constant inlet and outlet boundary conditions (represented by gas and liquid mass flow rates and separator pressure, respectively), unsteady-state flow may occur in a pipeline/riser system operating at relatively low gas and liquid flow rates. The cyclic unsteady-state flow characterized by large-amplitude pressure and flow rate fluctuations has been referred to as severe slugging. This study is an experimental investigation of flow instabilities, especially severe slugging, in a relatively long hilly-terrain pipeline/ riser system. Five types of flow regimes were found and characterized on the basis of visual observation and the measured pressure drop over the riser.

AB  - Severe slugging is an important flow assurance issue, typically observed in offshore pipeline-riser systems. The consequences of severe slugging include flooding of downstream production facilities and an overall decrease in productivity. It had been previously thought that severe slugging would be limited to systems with a downward inclined pipeline and vertical, catenary or lazy-S shaped riser. This paper presents the results of an experimental and modeling study, which demonstrates the existence of severe slugging in systems with upward inclined lateral flow paths such as a toe-down well. The severe slugging phenomena described in this paper was observed in a large scale experimental facility constructed for the purpose of studying flow behavior in horizontal wells. The facility enabled the study of the effect of the completion parameters like end of tubing location and the presence of a packer. Various gas and liquid rates were tested in the facility, and slug flow was the dominant flow pattern in the lateral section. The facility was also designed to test gas lift performance in horizontal wells. Therefore, the effect of gas lift on the severe slugging phenomenon was also studied. Based on the experimental observations, two severe slugging prediction models were developed. The first was a transient model based on the Balino et al. (2010) model. The second was a single point criterion based on the Bøe (1981) criterion. The constitutive equations and modeling results are also presented in this paper.

AB  - Offshore petroleum production systems are subject to the occurrence of severe slugging, or terrain induced slugging, an unstable flow regime that causes flow oscillations and may result in production shutdown. In this context, active feedback control may be implemented in order to avoid such flow oscillations and obtain the maximum possible production flow rate. For using model-based control, a simplified dynamic model of the production system is required. This work presents a new simplified model, which may be applied to risers with S-shaped geometry. Results obtained with the new proposed model show a good agreement with a high-fidelity reference model developed in LedaFlow™.

AB  - ABSTRACT For early recognition of flow regime in pipeline-riser system, use of signals from accelerometers are suggested instead of a commonly used pressure gauge signal. A main factor that discriminates between stable flow and severe slugging is drastically decreased vibration in liquid accumulation of the severe slugging. In this study, a support vector machine is employed for binary classification to identify between stable flow and severe slugging. For multi-class classification, a neural network is applied to recognize four classes of stable flow, two types of severe slugging, and irregular transition. The performance is also analyzed based on the signal length employed. INTRODUCTION Pipeline-riser structures are generally used in offshore oil and gas field. Transported mixtures of liquids, gases, and solid components through horizontal (or inclined) pipeline are raised up to topside via the vertical riser. In the pipeline-riser system, a typical severe slugging can be produced with undesired blowout. It can cause liquid overflow, low production, high pressure in separators, corrosion increase, overload on gas compressors, and extra fatigue induced by cyclic impact (Hill and Wood, 1994; Kang, 1996; Pedersen, 2017; Schmidt, 1985; Sun and Jepson, 1992; Yocum, 1973). The severe slugging should be detected and controlled as quickly as possible to ensure flow assurance for safety and economic benefits. Many studies have classified multiphase flow regimes using machine learning algorithms (Goudinakis, 2004; Mi, 1998; Rosa, 2010; Trafalis, 2005; Wu, 2001; Ye and Guo, 2013; Zou, 2017). For the pipeline-riser system, Goudinakis (2004) investigated an experiment in a S-shaped riser system and measured differential pressures. An input of a neural network (NN) was the normalized differential pressures in 100 seconds. Classes of bubble, oscillation, slug, and severe slugging 1 were identified. Ye and Guo (2013) also performed an experiment in the S-shaped riser to acquire differential pressures. The length of sample was 20 minutes. Least square support vector machines (LS-SVM) were trained with statistical features including mean, variance, skewness, and power spectral densities. Five classes of severe slugging 1, severe slugging 2, severe slugging transition, oscillation, and stable flow were recognized. Zou (2017) obtained differential pressure in the pipeline riser system, calculated feature vectors using mean and range of differential pressures, and adopted the LS-SVM. Samples of various length were analyzed, especially the shortest samples of 6.8 seconds were tested based on the LS-SVM trained by samples of 8.99 seconds. Severe slugging, oscillation, stable like flow, and stable flow were classified. The commonly used pressure gauge has advantages in low cost and application at wide range of temperatures and pressures. However, a pressure tap can be blocked; the pressure can be affected not only by flow regime but also by the phase’s velocity (Rosa, 2010); and it is difficult to move into another place after its first installation.

AB  - Abstract With the most recent down turn in the oil industry, there is an urgent need to optimize production from deepwater oil fields. Adopting a technically sound and cost-effective severe slug mitigation technique is very important. In this work, a sample deepwater oil field in West-Africa operating at over 1000m water depth, currently operating at over 150,000 bbl/d and with an oil API of 47 °, GOR of 385.91 Sm3/Sm3 and a water-cut of over 10%; experienced slugging during it’s early life. This slugging scenario was modelled and subsequently fine-tuned to severe slugging by moderating the flow rates. Self-lift and Gas-lift were then separately applied to mitigate the severe slugging scenario. The results of this work highlighted that the self-lift technique proves effective for valve openings of 0.85, 0.65 and 0.35 for a 4 inch and 3 inch diameter bypass line. The gas lift technique proved effective with increased mass flow rate from 7kg/s and 12kg/s. Although both techniques mitigated the severe slug, the power consumption required by the gas lift technique for 12kg/s the best scenario proved to be huge at about 75,921,254.54 kw and at over $10,000,000 (USD) cost. This was not the case with the self-lift technique which required no external power source for its functionality.

AB  - Recently, with the ever-increasing development of offshore fields, the use of long risers fed by lateral flow lines has significantly increased. This type of configuration exposes the production system to severe slugging, particularly with decline in reservoir pressure and consequently flow rates. Severe slugging can cause huge pressure fluctuations and may result in decreased recovery and separator flooding. This study is an experimental and theoretical effort to analyze how the application of surfactants can suppress or eliminate severe slugging. The experimental study is performed in a 2-in ID facility, consisting of a 64-ft flow line with 1° downward inclination, followed by a 41-ft riser. Water and compressed air are the liquid and gas phases, and an anionic surfactant is applied continuously. First, effects of surfactant delivery location are investigated by injecting at three points, namely, riser base and flowline inlet without or with a static mixer, used as an external source of agitation. Pressure and holdup fluctuations with time, slugging frequency and surfactant efficiency are monitored. Moreover, a high-speed camera is used to monitor blowout stage and analyze gas front thickness and velocity. Pressure fluctuations and surfactant efficiency are experimentally investigated by changing the operating conditions. Tests include without and with surfactant at different liquid and gas flow rates. Firstly, the experiments are conducted with lowest superficial gas velocity (vSg) and highest superficial liquid velocity (vSL) values. At these conditions, severe slugging is partially eliminated only with high surfactant concentration and the use of static mixer. The use of surfactant in other locations results in elimination of slug production stage and reduced cycle duration, but negligible changes in pressure profile. Then, a new test matrix is designed to conduct tests at higher vSg and lower vSL values, moving towards the boundary of Bøe's criterion for severe slugging. Under these conditions, severe slugging cycle durations and pressure fluctuations reduce and elimination efficiency of surfactant increases significantly. In addition, severe slugging severity and elimination efficiency are correlated with Boe's criterion coefficient. This study is an attempt to characterize severe slugging magnitude based on operating conditions, and investigate surfactant efficiency for different delivery locations. Considering the limited number of studies on this subject, the results can provide an experimental and theoretical source to optimize surfactant application in production systems facing severe slugging.

AB  - AbstractIn a flowline/riser system large liquid slugs and gas surges can be formed by operational changes or can be due to the specific flow conditions and physical characteristics of the flowline. These liquid slugs and gas surges may result into significant oil and gas production deferment. Slugging may cause high-level trips in separators and can lead to unstable operation of topside facilities.Slug mitigation plays a very important role in the drive of exploration and production companies for operational excellence and increased profits. Shell Global Solutions is developing cutting-edge technologies to solve problems associated with slugging. In the late nineties Shell Global Solutions developed the Slug Suppression System (S3) that is now in operation in the North Sea. The field experience with the system has proven that the S3 controls/mitigates slugging.Striving for advanced technical and cost-efficient solutions, we have developed a new slug suppression device: the Vessel-Less S3. The new product integrates the benefits of the conventional S3 controller schemes and the T-junction in-line separation technology as an efficient means of slug mitigation. The new system comprises a stratifier, a downcomer, two T-junctions, gas and liquid outlets and two control valves. The control algorithms of the original S3 are applied for the slug mitigation and control. Instead of the vessel, standard piping is used in the construction of the Vessel-Less S3.On the way to a new commercial product, the Vessel-Less S3 has now been proven in laboratory environment, and needs to be tested further in the field. The Vessel-Less S3 has the potential to become an attractive device for slug mitigation and control. The development of the Vessel-Less S3 will enable operating companies to implement the S3 technology at lower costs and with reduced weight/space requirements.IntroductionIn a flowline/riser system, two types of slugging are distinguished: severe and transient slugging.Severe slugging is the worst case of gravity-induced slugs. Gravity induced slugs are formed in the low points of a pipeline, where liquid accumulates and blocks the line. If the hydrostatic pressure build-up exceeds the gas pressure build-up in the flowline, the inclined part of the line will be filled with liquid before the gas pressure will drive the liquid slug out of the line. Severe slugging is initiated at low flow rates at the foot of the riser with downward inclined upstream flowline.Transient slugs have another origin than gravity-induced slugs. A transient slug can be generated by an operational change (e.g. the increase of production which may effect the gas-liquid ratio in the line) or by instability of the gas/liquid interface. The pipeline is not necessarily blocked by the liquid, but a region with a higher liquid hold-up travels like a wave through the pipeline. Those transient slugs that are generated by instability of the gas/liquid interface (i.e. hydrodynamic slugs) can occur under separated flow conditions and may be stable and can increase in size.The main impact of slugging is production deferment caused by:Platform trips as a result of liquid and gas surgesInefficient utilization of the first stage separator, since part of its volume is needed for slug catchingProcess instabilities, which decrease separator efficiency and cause unsteady operation of compressors, heat exchangers etc.Slow well bean-up to avoid the formation of large slugsTop-side choking to restrict the liquid productionThe standard approach to the liquid slugging problem is the installation of a large slugcatcher or topside choking. Sometimes an "intelligent choke" is applied that is placed upstream of the production separator and maintains an acceptable liquid level in the production separator.

AB  - ABSTRACT A common concept for oil production and export comprises the use of Floating Production Storage and Offloading (FPSO) vessels. These vessels, whether purpose built or, alternatively, converted tankers receive live produced oil which is then processed on board in preparation for export. On the FPSO, gas is separated from the oil and is typically used for fuel gas, lift gas, or injection gas. There may be times when fuel gas production is forecast to reach a deficit. To address this, additional produced gas may be spiked into the oil export pipeline to the FPSO and used as a source of fuel gas. During the front-end engineering and design (FEED) phase of a recent project, dynamic multiphase pipeline simulation showed that the oil pipeline would experience slugging across a wide range of operating conditions when fuel gas is spiked into the oil export pipeline. To mitigate slugging, a slug control valve was introduced at the outlet of the oil export pipeline. Further simulation demonstrated that using the slug control valve, slugging can be effectively mitigated. The primary objective for the study was to recommend the simplest possible operating procedure to manage slugging in the oil export pipeline after the introduction of fuel gas spiking. In addition to avoiding slugging, the recommended slug control valve positions also needed to ensure that the pressure at the inlet of the oil export pipeline would not exceed a given threshold. Further simulation was also necessary to ensure that the slug control valve operating procedure would work irrespective of which gas is being used to spike the oil export line given that two different sources of gas with differing compositions are available. The results for only one composition will be presented here.

AB  - A major challenge when operating a gas lifted unconventional well is severe slugging. Without addressing its root causes, production fluctuation can remain for a long time and pose high risks to the entire operating system. This paper first reviews the gas lift for U.S. unconventional shale plays. Then it describes the major causes of gas lifted shale well slugging and proposes mitigation plans respectively, considering the implications on value and profitability. A systemic diagnostic workflow was developed for shale well slugging by combing production data analytics and dynamic simulation workflow. It also incorporated cost benefit analysis to evaluate incremental economic value. Transient modeling reveals key aspects of gas lift well slugging causes. A case study involving a shale well demonstrates the technical and economic impact of this transient behavior on gas-lift well performance. This study can assist operators in developing a mitigation plan for gas-lifted shale well severe slugging through transient simulation and in leading to substantial cost saving while extending asset economic life. It also demonstrates that transient multiphase flow simulation is an effective tool for the troubleshooting and the mitigation strategy selection for unconventional shale wells under gas lift.

AB  - AbstractEquipment integrity and systems reliability are of paramount interest in oil and gas industry as they guarantee not only the safety of personnel working in the field but also for the protection of environmental degradation that could inadvertently occur due to unprecedented equipment failure. This paper presents a finite element analysis of the riser base that is subject to repeated loading resulting from severe slug flow in an offshore production flowline-riser (TTR) system. Commercial software packages used in this simulation study are PVTsim 20, OLGA 7 and ABAQUS 6.14-1. The typical flowline-riser pipe system was modeled with a 10 inch (0.254 m) nominal pipe size (NPS) of wall thickness 0.562 inch (0.0143 m) and of API 5L Grade X- 65 steel material. PVTsim was used to generate the PVT properties of the fluid model which is a typical heavy oil of API gravity in the range of 23-27 degrees and hence the preparation of fluid table files for the multiphase simulator. Slug tracking module in the program was used to track the severe slug development in the flowline-riser system for a typical oilfield producing at the rate of 10000 barrels of oil per day (bopd) (1584 m³/day). Pressure-time series prediction by the multiphase simulator at the riser base was used to plot the pressure amplitude loading curve in ABAQUS for the structural analysis. Numerical results from multiphase simulator shows that severe slugging occurs in the riser at that production rate and the riser base experiences the most pressure loading during the slug buildup in the riser and as well as the cyclic loading behavior of severe slugging in the riser, while that of ABAQUS implicit dynamic analysis shows the displacement mode of the structure and stress distributions in the finite element model of the riser base during the peak of the severe slugging for 5 cycles period of the severe slug flow. The results of this numerical study will provide a technical data for the enhancement of the design of a riser pipe especially the 10 inch nominal pipe size considered in this paper which has substantial application in deepwater offshore field development.

AB  - AbstractThe present work aims at investigating the performance of the LedaFlow multiphase simulator for transient terrain slugging scenarios. A number of two-phase riser slugging experiments performed at the SINTEF Large Scale Multiphase Laboratory are analyzed and simulated with LedaFlow. The experiments were conducted in an 8-inch pipe using Diesel and Nitrogen as fluids at pressures between 20 and 50 bar. The pipe geometry is approximately 423 meters long, and includes a 50 meter long "bump", a 65 meter declined pipe (-2 degrees) and a 54 meter long riser at the end. The gas supply line was 416 m long providing an upstream gas volume that gives extra compressibility to the system, facilitating liquid accumulation at the riser base and subsequent terrain slugging. The experiments show that at constant gas flow rates, the severity/amplitude of the slugging in the riser increases to a maximum at a superficial liquid velocity around 0.5-1 m/s (depending on the conditions), and then decreases to zero as the liquid flow rate is further increased. The experiments are reproduced well by the LedaFlow simulations, both in terms of pressure amplitudes and slugging periods.

AB  - ABSTRACTThe aging of petroleum wells causes reduced reservoir pressures and increased hydrostatic head of liquid in the production tubing and flowlines. Although foamer applications to unload liquids are common in gas fields, these foamers were found to be unsuitable for oil well applications.A research program resulted in the development of an effective Black Oil Foamer (BOF) for oil well applications with several potential benefits for producers. By reducing liquid loading in flowing wells and flowlines, the BOF can minimize slugging and increase oil & gas production. For wells that are cycling due to liquid loading, the BOF can minimize the non-productive downtime.To meet varied field applications, the BOF needed to be effective over a wide range of crude oils. Flexibility in application methods including capillary, gas lift, subsea umbilical, or batch were also needed. Other requirements were to be thermally stable at wellbore temperatures, non-emulsifying, and not corrosive. In addition, the BOF needed to create a foam stable enough to unload liquids from a well but readily resolvable with common defoamers. This paper will discuss three successful, deepwater BOF field applications in the Gulf of Mexico. In all three cases, slugging was reduced with enhanced oil production, and without issues of oil/water separation or emulsification.INTRODUCTIONThroughout the life cycle of oil and gas wells, there is a reduction in the bottom hole pressure (BHP) over time. This reduction in BHP can cause liquid loading in the production tubing and flowline and result in increased hydrostatic pressure and a lower production rate. Without the application of deliquification technologies to lower hydrostatic pressure, the production rate typically declines much more quickly than the natural decline curve, and premature ceasing of production can occur. Consequently, deliquification technologies are frequently applied to these wells to reduce hydrostatic pressure. This application can enable these wells to reach the natural decline level and experience increased production. Commonly used deliquification technologies include gas lift, plunger lift, electrical submersible pumps (ESP), and foamers (Dunning et al., 1961). Because foamers are flexible in their method of application and relatively economical, foamers have become a commonly used deliquification method for increasing production in gas fields.

AB  - AbstractImproving flow simulators for multiphase flow with viscous oils is of concern for the oil industry as the available database for model validation is quite limited for the case of highly viscous oils. Severe slugging is a particular flow phenomenon where the quality of dynamic simulators is important. Two experimental series on severe slugging have been made in a S-shaped riser geometry (50mm inner diameter, 14 m length and 6.5 m height), one using viscous oil and the other using water as a reference. The experimental results are time recordings, amplitudes of pressure oscillations at riser base and slugging frequencies.The experimental results are compared with simulations with a multiphase flow simulator.

AB  - Recently, with the ever-increasing development of offshore fields, the use of long risers fed by lateral flow lines has significantly increased. This type of configuration exposes the production system to severe slugging, particularly with decline in reservoir pressure and consequently flow rates. Severe slugging can cause huge pressure fluctuations and may result in decreased recovery and separator flooding. This study is an experimental and theoretical effort to analyze how the application of surfactants can suppress or eliminate severe slugging. The experimental study is performed in a 2-in ID facility, consisting of a 64-ft flow line with 1° downward inclination, followed by a 41-ft riser. Water and compressed air are the liquid and gas phases, and an anionic surfactant is applied continuously. First, effects of surfactant delivery location are investigated by injecting at three points, namely, riser base and flowline inlet without or with a static mixer, used as an external source of agitation. Pressure and holdup fluctuations with time, slugging frequency and surfactant efficiency are monitored. Moreover, a high-speed camera is used to monitor blowout stage and analyze gas front thickness and velocity. Pressure fluctuations and surfactant efficiency are experimentally investigated by changing the operating conditions. Tests include without and with surfactant at different liquid and gas flow rates. Firstly, the experiments are conducted with lowest superficial gas velocity (vSg) and highest superficial liquid velocity (vSL) values. At these conditions, severe slugging is partially eliminated only with high surfactant concentration and the use of static mixer. The use of surfactant in other locations results in elimination of slug production stage and reduced cycle duration, but negligible changes in pressure profile. Then, a new test matrix is designed to conduct tests at higher vSg and lower vSL values, moving towards the boundary of Bøe's criterion for severe slugging. Under these conditions, severe slugging cycle durations and pressure fluctuations reduce and elimination efficiency of surfactant increases significantly. In addition, severe slugging severity and elimination efficiency are correlated with Boe's criterion coefficient. This study is an attempt to characterize severe slugging magnitude based on operating conditions, and investigate surfactant efficiency for different delivery locations. Considering the limited number of studies on this subject, the results can provide an experimental and theoretical source to optimize surfactant application in production systems facing severe slugging.

AB  - IntroductionThe combination of declining reservoir pressure and increasing water production in aging fields along with certain common pipeline/riser geometries can create or exacerbate riser slugging. The severity of riser slugging typically becomes worse with increasing riser height and may be especially problematic for some aging deep-water production systems. Severe riser slugging is characterized by large fluctuations of liquid (oil and water) and gas production arriving at the topsides first stage separator. The severe slugging cycle is divided in four steps as described in Figure 1. The classic pipe geometry for severe slugging is a slightly downward section upstream of a riser. In step 1, gas and liquid velocities are low enough to allow stratified flow in the downward sloping pipe section followed by liquid bridging and accumulation at the bottom of the riser. The hydrostatic pressure of the accumulated liquid initially increases equal to or faster than the build-up of gas pressure upstream of the liquid plug (Step 2). When the gas pressure eventually exceeds the hydrostatic head of the liquid slug, the gas will begin to push the liquid plug out of the riser and start to penetrate the riser (Step 3). The pressure in the gas reduces as the liquid is removed from the riser and the gas expands increasing the velocities in the riser. After most of the liquid and gas exits the riser, the velocity of the gas is no longer high enough to sweep the liquid upwards. Liquid film not swept from the riser starts falling back down the riser (Step 4) and the accumulation of liquid starts again.

AB  - ABSTRACTA CFD method is proposed to simulate the gas-liquid severe slugging in a pipeline-riser system in the present paper. Based on the consistence principle of the severe slugging formation condition, the 3D flow in a pipeline-riser system is simplified into a 2D flow. The severe slug flow in a pipeline-riser system with a given pipeline declination angle is simulated numerically. The effects of gas-liquid physical parameters on slug flow characteristics are studied and analyzed when the liquids are water, crude oil and kerosene, and the gas are methane and air, respectively. Numerical results show that physical properties of the liquid, including viscosity, density and surface tension, have remarkable influence on the characteristics of severe slugging, including the flow pattern, the period and the pressure fluctuation, whereas the influence of the gas physical properties on the characteristics of the severe slugging is not significant. INTRODUCTIONThe pipeline-riser system, including a downward inclined pipeline and a vertical riser, is needed to transport oil (with water) and associated gas from subsea wellheads up to offshore platform systems in the exploitation of offshore oil and gas (Sertã, 2004). At low flow rates of gas and liquid, one important problem experienced in such a pipeline-riser system is a severe slugging phenomenon that is defined as the buildup of liquid slug that equals to or exceeds the riser’s height (Schmidt, 1985; Fabre, 1990). This phenomenon, also called terrain-induced slugging, is a considerably harmful flow pattern in offshore petroleum production systems because of its high potential in causing sudden fluctuations of pressure and flow mass in the pipeline and overflow or interruption of the terminal gas-liquid separator (Sarica, 2000). Such a severe slug flow can thus damage the production equipment and greatly reduce the production capability. The gas-liquid severe slugging in a pipeline-riser system has been studied experimentally in several flow laboratories.

AB  - ABSTRACT A very simple, low-cost gas-liquid flow meter that only employs conventional field instrumentation has been used to monitor severe slugging occurring at the exit of a vertical pipe. This meter was originally developed for conventional oil field applications [1] and is based on the readings of a multiphase orifice and the pressure drops of the gas-liquid mixture flowing in a vertical section of the pipe. Liquid and gas flow rates have been determined by means of semi-empirical equations developed for the specific set of flow parameters (geometry, flow rates, physical properties) adopted in a series of laboratory tests conducted in the Multiphase Flow Laboratory of TEA Sistemi. The transient behavior of the flow system, including the orifice, has also been predicted by means of a 1-D flow simulator [2]. The results of these simulations agree well with the experimental readings, thus providing a powerful method to monitor severe slugging by means of low cost instrumentation, in particular, by replacing a cumbersome instrument such as a gamma-densitometer with a differential pressure transmitter. In field operation, the multiphase orifice used in these experiments can be replaced by a calibrated control valve. INTRODUCTION The accuracy of multi-phase flow meters (MPFMs) has been and still is disappointing. To some extent, this is due to the complexity of the flow system and to several mechanical or chemical effects, such as solids deposition, erosion and corrosion, that alter the flow conditions inside the meter. On the other hand, the complexity of the flow system would suggest the use of “as simple as possible” MPFMs, but often this is not the case. To give an example, a radioactive source is often deployed to measure the mixture density, but this requires a careful analysis of gamma ray attenuation through the pipe wall and the multiphase stream, introducing several potential errors, and definitely represents a cumbersome device [3]. At the same time, it only provides the measurement of the liquid hold-up, which is related to the non-slip liquid volume fraction by some type of empirical equation.

AB  - Abstract Transient multiphase pipeline models have found wide use in upstream oil and gas production. Such models have been successfully used to estimate such transient events as flow ramp-up, pigging, and terrain slugging.  However, it is not often appreciated how much can be done using steady-state multiphase models.  Such models - along with minimal additional analysis - can be used to estimate liquid flow rate, liquid hold-up and pressure drop changes that are equivalent to full transient simulations.  The focus of this paper will be on the use of steady-state models to estimate transient behavior, including estimates of ramp-up and pigging slugs, as well as terrain slugging severity (including slug size and frequency). Introduction Oil and gas production are, in most cases, gas-liquid multiphase flow rather than single-phase gas or liquid flow. Both transient and steady-state flow need to be simulated to properly design such a system and safely operate it. Intuitively, one would think that steady-state models should only be used for steady-state events; transient flow models would be required to simulate transient events, such as flow ramp-up, pipeline pigging, and terrain slugging. However, this may not be always true. This paper will discuss the use of steady-state models to estimate some transient events with some additional analysis, with accuracy comparable to transient simulations. By no means do the authors advocate the use steady-state models in all instances; transient flow models are definitely recommended where either too much analysis work is required, or the accuracy is significantly compromised through the use of steady-state models. Danielson et al. (2000) discussed in more detail where transient models should be used, and where steady-state models may suffice. Some exercises of using steady-state models to estimate transient events have been conducted by previous investigators (Cunliffe, 1978; Schmidt et al., 1985; Pots et al., 1987; and Xiao and Shoup, 1998). Cunliffe (1978) used steady-state liquid inventory to predict the ramp-up slug size and condensate flow rate at pipeline receiving end during a production ramp-up in a 107-km long, 0.5-m ID wet-gas pipeline. Comparison with actual condensate flow rate data showed errors within 15%. Schmidt et al. (1985) suggested that the existence of severe slugging in a pipeline-riser system can be determined using riser pressure drop - gas flow rate plot. If the curve has a negative slope, i.e. the riser pressure drop decreases with increasing gas flow rate, then the flow in riser is unstable and severe slugging may exist if other requirements are met. If the curve has a positive slope, i.e. the riser pressure drop increases with increasing flow rate, then the flow in riser is stable and severe slugging will not occur. Pots et al. (1987) argued that the relationship between unstable riser flow and severe slugging requires additional conditions be met in addition to the criterion of Schmidt. They proposed a dimensionless number, which is the ratio of pressure buildup rate in the pipeline to that in the riser. If the ratio is above one, which means the pressure buildup in the pipeline is faster than that in the riser, then severe slugging will not occur; if the ratio is less than one, severe slugging will take place. The smaller is this pressure build-up ratio, the more severe the slugging will be. Xiao and Shoup (1998) demonstrated that steady-state models can be used to extract important information such as pig transit time, liquid build up rate behind the pig, pig exit speed, the time for the pipeline to return to steady-state after pigging. Such information is of great importance to determine the slug catcher size and pigging frequency. This paper will focus on using steady-state models to predict slug size and liquid flow rate at pipeline receiving end during a production ramp-up, slug size from pigging a pipeline (both before and after the steady-state is reached in the pipeline), and severe slugging characteristics in a pipeline-riser system including its existence, slug size, and slug frequency.     For comparison purpose, OLGA®5.3 (a transient multiphase flow simulator marketed and supported by SPT Group) was used for both the steady-state and transient simulations in the present study.

AB  - Abstract An experimental study of severe slugging suppression utilizing a combination of surfactants and gas-lift was conducted using a facility consisting of a 3-in. ID, 65 ft long, -3° inclined flow line followed by a 45 ft long vertical riser system.  Air and water were used as fluids.  The surfactant used was a foaming agent capable of forming stable foams in all brines for a wide range of pH.  Pressure behavior in the flow line – riser system was monitored and input gas, injection gas, liquid and surfactant flow rates were continuously measured.  In addition, visual observations were made to identify severe slugging.  Effects of the proposed method were quantified with a modified elimination performance index (MEPI) considering not only pressure fluctuations but also back-pressure effects.  A total of 30 tests were conducted.  The data were analyzed for the severe slugging suppression of the surfactant and gas-lift combination, the effect of gas lift on surfactant injection, and the effect of the surfactant on the reduction of the gas-lift gas.  The combination technique with the highest gas-lift rate completely eliminated the severe slugging for the all of the tests conducted.  Surfactants were able to suppress severe slugging for most of the cases.  The performance of “Only Surfactant Injection Case” increases as the gas-liquid ratio increases.  For all of the tests, back-pressure reduction was observed.  MEPI is used as the main parameter to assess the performance of the severe slugging suppression methods.  Gas-lift not only contributes with density reduction through volumetric increase of gas in the riser but it also reduces the mixture density by promoting more foam generation.  There were reductions in the gas-lift rate from the original maximum gas-lift injection rate for all the tests conducted with surfactant injection. Introduction The use of long deep-water risers that conduct production from multiple wellheads on the sea floor to the surface predisposes the system to severe slugging in the riser for a wide range of flow rates and seabed topography.  Considering the length of the deep-water risers, the problem is expected to be more severe than in production systems installed in shallower waters.  Severe slugging could occur at high pressure, with the magnitude of the pressure fluctuations so large as to cause a shorter natural flow period with subsequent consequences such as premature field abandonment, loss of recoverable reserves and earlier-than-planned deployment of boosting devices. Severe slugging will typically be experienced in two-phase flow systems where a pipeline segment with a downward inclination angle is followed by another segment/riser with an upward inclination angle for relatively low gas and liquid flow rates.  Severe slugging will cause periods of no liquid and gas production in the separator followed by very high liquid and gas flow rates.  The resulting large pressure and flow rate fluctuations are highly undesirable.  Several mitigation techniques are proposed in the literature.  A thorough summary of these techniques can be found in Sarica and Tengesdal (2000).  Surfactant application and gas lift are typically considered as separate methods.  The combination of both can provide a better mitigation of severe slugging by complementing each other.  As mentioned by Sarica and Tengesdal (2000), Yocum (1973) was the first to identify multiple severe slugging mitigation techniques.  These are reduction of the line diameter, splitting the flow into dual or multiple streams, gas injection into the riser, utilizing mixing devices at the riser base, choking, and back-pressure increase.  Here, we will classify severe slugging mitigation methods into three groups, namely, passive, active and hybrids (combination of both passive and active mitigation methods).

AB  - INTRODUCTIONProduction from a Gulf of Mexico well test exhibited a severe slugging behaviour into the riser. The data was analysed to determine the cause of several major flow rate decreases which caused the severe slugging. Based on the measurements, a restriction downstream of the wellhead, and not the reservoir productivity, could be causing a decline in flow rate which would lead to severe slugging. This paper discusses the field data analysis to provide an insight into the severe slugging behaviour. In addition, the paper will show the importance of using transient simulators in problem solving of flow assurance issues.

AB  - Technology Focus Flow assurance and multiphase-flow design, engineering, operations, and maintenance technical concerns have presented interesting and challenging issues requiring safe, economical solutions over my 20+ years of project experience around the world in both onshore unconventional and offshore conventional production facilities as an engineering, procurement, and construction contractor; major operator; manufacturer; and consultant. While gas-hydrate prediction and handling typically dominates the thermohydraulic design, the subsequent long-term mitigation of slugging and various flow-assurance phenomena, along with prevention of wax, erosion, asphaltenes, corrosion, and salt deposition, are all challenging issues.  First, severe slugging, frequently observed in pipeline and riser systems, is an important flow-assurance issue. The consequences of slugging usually involve flooding of downstream pipeline and production facilities and an overall decrease in field and system productivity. On the basis of experimental observations, severe slugging prediction models were developed and verified. Second, regular intervention activities to improve flow assurance, such as frequent pigging and injection of chemical inhibitors or drag-reducing agents, all require operational expense and require safety oversight and downtime. Internal pipeline coatings and liners are available solutions that could provide long-term benefits. Third, access to real-time production data on a desktop computer could improve an operations/pipeline engineer’s efficiency and system performance greatly. A smart management system is described that is capable of retrieving and evaluating flow-assurance-related data from multiple wells. This system can allow the operator to make better-informed decisions on the basis of a consistent data set with less time spent gathering and analyzing the data. The papers presented here discuss slightly different issues and approaches to multiphase flow continuity and production flow assurance. Severe slugging consequences typically include flooding of pipeline and production facilities and a subsequent decrease in production rate. Such severe slugging was previously thought to be limited to systems with upward, inclined pipeline or vertical, catenary or lazy-S-shaped risers. However, paper SPE 191611 presents the results of an experimental and modeling study that demonstrates the existence of severe slugging in systems with upward, inclined lateral flow paths such as a toe-down well, similar to that observed in a large-scale experimental facility specially constructed for studying flow behavior in horizontal wells.    Pipeline internal deposits, such as corrosion and scale, can reduce the flow efficiency and design capacity of a transport system greatly. The use of interior pipeline coatings and liners is a potential long-term design solution that could provide long-term refurbishment benefits. The work described in paper SPE 193109 involves a novel material designed to interact specifically with highly corroded and weathered pipe, thus enabling in-place application and refurbishment.       Paper SPE 191951 describes a smart management system used for retrieving and evaluating all flow-assurance-related data for more than 700 wells in both onshore and offshore fields. The paper discusses system architecture, interface details, system design, functionality, visualization, application, and the benefits of the system.  The papers presented here, including the additional reading papers on the potential novel applications of subsea tieback technology, focus on developing new analytical tools and new materials while providing safe, cost-effective, and reliable operations for flow assurance. I hope you find them as interesting as I did, and I greatly appreciate this opportunity to disseminate these new technology options to you in this and future Technology Focus sections.

AB  - Summary With the recent developments in the oil and gas industry, in which the number of satellite fields are increasing, the industry faces major challenges. A mixture of gas and oil is transported in multiphase pipelines along the bottom of the sea from the wells and up through the riser to the oil rig. The development of unstable flow in multiphase pipelines is a major and expensive problem. The irregular flow results in poor oil/water separation, limits the production capacity, and causes flaring. Handling slug flow thus has become very important with regard to increasing the production rate and avoiding possible equipment damages. In this paper, we have developed a model of a physical process that generates slugs. The model has been verified against experimental data. Several control strategies have been tested on the model, and the simulation results are presented. It is shown by simulation of multiphase flow that the unstable slug flow can be stabilized by feedback control. In addition, interesting and important phenomena such as inverse response of the pressure at the top and asymmetric response of the pressure at the bottom have been revealed and explained. Introduction Multiphase pipelines connecting remote wellhead platforms and subsea wells are a common feature of offshore oil production. Recent developments indicate that this trend will be followed in the future. In addition, the feasibility of using long-distance tieback pipelines to connect subsea processing units directly to onshore processing plants makes it likely that these will also be deployed in the future.  These trends in offshore oil production face a major challenge. The slug phenomenon in multiphase flow lines with both gas and liquid hydrocarbons has gained increased interest in recent years. Slugging can be characterized as either hydrodynamic or terrain slugging. Hydrodynamic slugs are built in horizontal parts of the pipeline when liquid and gas velocities are different. These slugs are usually short with higher frequency. The inlet separator will in most cases handle these slugs with fewer difficulties, because the amount of liquid is small compared to the volume of the separator. On the contrary, a terrain slug can contain a lot of liquid and represents a great challenge to the downstream processing system.  Level and pressure variations in the first-stage separator can be propagated in the downstream process. Variations in the separator level may cause poor separation and occasionally fluid flooding. Oscillations in the separator pressure can result in increased flaring, which is environmentally benign and is also costly because of CO2 taxes. The degree of slugging depends on various factors. The most important are pipeline pressure, pipeline topology, and production rate. Terrain slugging is most likely to occur at low rates, with a low pipeline pressure toward the end of a well's lifetime.

AB  - Abstract Loss circulation is commonly induced while drilling wells through depleted intervals. The combination of narrow margin between formation pore pressure and fracture pressure makes loss circulation inevitable in many wells. Pretreatment of the drilling fluid with loss-circulation material while drilling and wellbore strengthening techniques have successfully reduced instances of high-rate, large-volume (>1000 bbl) losses. Fracture width and volume created by high-rate, large-volume losses often limit the effectiveness of conventional loss-circulation treatments for two reasons. First, the size and concentration of bridging materials that will effectively bridge the fracture opening can plug the bottomhole drilling assembly. A trip may be required to remove the bit and other components of the bottomhole drilling assembly. If losses are severe, this trip may not be possible without risk to well control. Second, it is difficult to restore and maintain wellbore strength to a level equivalent to the integrity prior to losses, especially if substantial openhole drilling time is required to reach the next casing point. This paper presents the design strategy, formulations and testing requirements, placement techniques and procedure, and other practices utilized in successful large-volume cement squeezes to remediate severe, high-rate, large-volume losses. Results from two deepwater case studies will be presented to illustrate successful application of this treatment approach. Cement squeezes can be performed through many bottomhole drilling assemblies, where conditions require, and eliminate the dependence of success on correct sizing of bridging particles. Large-volume, specially designed cement squeezes have proven effective methods to restore wellbore integrity after loss rates as high as 320 to 480 bbl/hr and total volume of losses to the formation of up to 4000 bbl prior to treatment. Induced-Fracture Dimensions Induced fractures are a common source of loss circulation when drilling depleted intervals. The average volume of losses for wells in this study was 4000 barrels. Fracture dimensions, particularly width, length and volume, significantly impact loss-circulation treatment design. Size, type, and concentration of loss-circulation material used in the treatment are directly related to fracture width according to bridging theory, which is commonly known and applied within the industry.  Treatment volume and other variables in the placement technique are impacted by fracture volume. Estimation of fracture width can be made through a variety of methods and range of sophistication. Formation material properties, in situ stress fields, pressure, flow (loss) rate, and fluid viscosities and efficiencies all impact fracture geometry. Fracture width is directly proportional to fracture height and length. Therefore, most methods for estimating fracture width require a height or length as input. In practice, fracture heights have been reasonably determined from logging information before and after the loss event. Hydraulic-fracturing simulation programs may be applied to these loss conditions to estimate fracture dimensions. Many of these programs include basic fracture geometry models widely used in the industry. 1- 4 These models have been adequate for estimating fracture widths for design of effective treatments in these loss-circulation conditions. Fracture length is often much greater than fracture height for these conditions, and both drilling fluids and cement slurries have much higher fluid efficiencies than do most fracturing fluids used for completions and stimulation treatments. Consideration of these basic differences may be helpful for selecting the most appropriate fracture-geometry model for estimating fracture width for severe loss-circulation treatment design.

AB  - Abstract Severe slugging is a cyclic flow regime which causes intermittent delivery of oil and gas which usually leads to flow separator flooding, production reduction, platform trips and plant shutdown. This paper presents a novel method for severe slugging mitigation. It describes the use of a Venturi for the improvement of system stability, increase in production and recovery. A Venturi is coupled to the pipeline-riser system upstream of the choke valve before the topside test separator for severe slug mitigation. Experiments were carried out in a 2″ pipeline-riser system which comprises of a 40 m long horizontal pipe connected to a 10.23 m high S-shape riser followed by a 5.2 m horizontal topside section. The effects of Venturi on severe slugging were investigated, gas perturbation method was used to analyse the effects of Venturi on the stability of the system, and the traditional choking technique and Hopf bifurcation technique were combined and used to investigate the stability and production increase performance of the pipeline-riser with Venturi applied. Experimental results show that with the Venturi applied, the system achieves stability quicker than without the Venturi in the pipeline-riser and reduced the pressure fluctuation range by 57 %. In addition, combining the Venturi with the choke valve to choke the pipeline-riser (bifurcation study) stabilised the system at higher valve opening and lower pressure compared to choking the pipeline-riser with the choke valve only. For the case studied (Vsl = 0.25 m/s and Vsg = 0.37 m/s) bifurcation (critical valve opening) occurred at 18 % valve opening and average riser base pressure value of 2.8 barg for the plain riser. However, with Venturi applied bifurcation occurred at a larger valve opening of 21% and a lower average riser base pressure value of 2.5 barg. The low loss of energy due to the gradual change in geometry of the Venturi may account for its ability to achieve stability at a lower riser base pressure. Thus, Venturi increased the valve opening by 17% and reduced the riser base pressure by 11%. These in practice translate to an increase in oil and gas production. This is a cost-effective severe slug mitigation method, its deployment at the topside is an additional advantage when compared with other methods that require subsea deployment. The increase in brown fields due to diminishing reserves of oil from reservoirs have made oil recovery very vital. This technique will help to extend the operational life of a reservoir, thus enhancing oil recovery and flow assurance.

AB  - ABSTRACTNowadays oil and gas development projects encounter many challenges from the design phase to the production phase including operational issues. Many of these challenges are related to the need to explore deeper and further from the coast. In transporting gas systems, situations such as low temperatures can lead to hydrate formation; presence of liquids can produce severe slugging in risers and receiving facilities; and transient events can jeopardize the integrity of the system.This paper presents a flow assurance study conducted to improve the design and reliability of an off-shore transporting gas system. The gas production system used for this study consisted of an offshore field positioned approximately 120 miles offshore in medium depth waters of approximately 360-480 feet. Four producing platforms convey the gas production to a tie-in platform and then it is transported via a 38-inch pipeline to a gas processing plant on shore. Sea water temperatures as low as 43°F during the winter were considered thus, hydrate formation and liquid management assessments were conducted using a multiphase software simulation tool. A detailed hydrothermal model of the entire system was developed and different operating conditions were evaluated using worst case scenarios for hydrate formation, liquid accumulation, and slugging. Hydrate inhibitor rates were calculated using a temperature depression safety margin, and the amount of inhibitor lost during the gas and liquid phases. This paper presents the methodology used in the assessments

AB  - Summary A set of small-scale air/water experiments has been carried out in a flowline/riser system to demonstrate how local gas accumulation in regions upstream from a riser or a well may give unstable flow, with cycling liquid production at the riser outlet. This unstable flow phenomenon differs from the well-known severe-slugging instability phenomenon in that the instability is driven by gas expansion in the riser, and not by expansion in the upstream pipeline. A Lagrangian slug tracking model was extended with the option of solving problems with entrained gas in slugs, and used to simulate the experiments. A simplified pressure/momentum scheme is applied. Sensitivity analyses were carried out for selected parameters. Good correspondence between experiments and simulations was found with respect to the period of the instability cycle for this gravity-dominated system. The experimental stability limits are also well reproduced.

AB  - AbstractWith the regional development of offshore oil field, the offshore oil and gas treatment and transportation system gets more and more complicated. Any change for the multiphase pipeline operation system such as shutdown, restart up, pigging, variation of the flowrates etc could arouse hydrodynamic or severe slugging, also the terrain fluctuant. Severe slugging could interfere the downstream process system and even bring about damage. The article analyses three cases in an offshore oilfield multiphase pipeline during pigging operation, and aims at analyzing the slugging flow problem and control methods to provide experience for similar case.Introduction For those offshore oil and gas fields with small-scale production and far away from the facilities they could rely on, there is almost no profit by independent development. In recent years, by means of regional development the non-benefit oilfields have been developed successively. In regional development projects, the well fluids produced from multiple wellhead platforms are transported through the subsea pipelines to the central processing platform or a FPSO(Floating Production Storage and Offloading) or to the onshore processing terminal by subsea pipeline. The gathering and transportation pipelines from general wellhead platforms to the central platforms, or to FPSO and even some pipelines from offshore platforms to onshore terminals are all typical multiphase transportation pipelines of crude oil, gas and water.In order to ensure the safety of the pipelines and improve the efficiency of the pipelines, regular pigging operation is needed. The speed of pig depends on the gas flow rate in the pigging process of the multiphase pipelines. Liquid will gather at the front end of the pig and lead to slug due to the speed differences between the gas phase and the liquid phase in the pipelines. Slug flow could cause mechanical problems and processing operational problems such as the instability in the liquid level in the separator, pressure fluctuation and process failure, and may even lead to shutdown of the whole oil fields.

AB  - Abstract The objectives of this study were to investigate the effects of coiled tubing size, flow path, gas lift and water cut on the onset of severe slugging and overall operating envelope. The coiled tubing was investigated as a technique for delaying the onset of slugging, which involved the use of larger diameter coiled tubing strings to decrease the flowing area in the annulus, or routing the flow up within coiled tubing instead of annulus to flow directly in coiled tubing. The operating envelope considering slugging and other system constraints was also investigated with the use of coiled tubing. The minimum non-slugging rate was reduced by using larger coiled tubing size with normal flow through annulus. A very low non-slugging rate was achieved with small diameter coiled tubing when producing through the coiled tubing, but a very narrow operation window was left when other system constraints were considered. The minimum non-slugging rate increased rapidly as the coiled tubing size increased when flowing within coiled tubing. Gas lift was effective in reducing the minimum non-slugging rate when it was increased from 0 to 4 mmscfd, but not very effective in one of the risers when it was further increased from 4 to 8 mmscfd. Increase of water cut appeared not to have a significant effect on the minimum non slugging rate. The study explored a new way of coiled tubing application in production design. It provides a guidance of how to effectively use coiled tubing as a technique to reduce the minimum non slugging rate, especially the flow through either annular or within coiled tubing. The field life can be extensively extended with a proper selection coiled tubing size, flow path and gas lift. A workflow of coiled tubing size selection and operating window determination considering different system constraints was also demonstrated. Introduction Severe slugging occurs when the production rate falls below a certain rate during mid-life and late-life, namely the "minimum non-slugging rate??. It can cause severe operational problems for oil and gas production, which is especially important for offshore fields due to the space limitation and workover cost. Deepwater fields often have hilly terrain subsea flowlines and close-to-vertical riser systems, which makes them more prone to the severe slugging problems. Once the severe slugging starts, the field economics can be significantly impacted and the field life can be shortened. Therefore, once the production rates falls below the thresholds, techniques for mitigating this anticipated severe slugging are desired to extend the field life or improve the field economics. Coiled tubing has been widely used in the oil and gas industry since its introduction to the market. Its application ranges from single measurement to drilling operations. In the current study, the coiled tubing was investigated as a technique for delaying the onset of severe slugging with the proper selection of coiled tubing size and flow paths. Model Development The analyses performed in this study were run with a commercial transient thermo-hydraulic software and an equation-of-state program. Since the coiled tubing study focused on the severe slugging in the flowline and riser system, the wellbores were not modeled and the inflow was modeled as a constant source to eliminate the well performance complications. This could also provide a generic results suiting for flow coming from different wells given the well conditions could change and different wells would be brought up in the future.

AB  - AbstractSevere slugging in multiphase pipelines can cause serious and troublesome operational problems for downstream receiving production facilities. Recent results demonstrating the feasibility and the potential of applying dynamic feedback control to unstable multiphase flow like severe slugging and casing heading have been published (Refs. 4,9,1,5 and 2). This paper summarizes our findings on terrain-induced slug flow (Ref. 2). Results from field tests and as well as results from dynamic multiphase flow simulations are presented. The simulations were performed with the pipeline code OLGA2000.The controllers applied to all of these cases aim to stabilize the flow conditions by applying feedback control rather than coping with the slug flow in the downstream processing unit. The results from simulations with feedback control show in all cases stable process conditions both at the pipeline inlet and outlet, whereas without control severe slug flow is experienced. Pipeline profile plots of liquid volume fraction through a typical slug flow cycle are compared against corresponding plots with feedback control applied. The comparison is used to justify internal stability of the pipeline. Feedback control enables in many cases a reduced pipeline inlet pressure, which again means increased production rate. The paper summarizes the experience gained with active feedback control applied to severe slugging. Focus will be on extracting similarities and differences between the cases. The main contribution is to demonstrate that dynamic feedback control can be a solution to the severe slugging problem.IntroductionMultiphase pipelines connecting remote wellhead platforms and subsea wells are already common in offshore oil production, and even more of them will be laid in the years to come. In addition, the proven feasibility of using long-distance tie back pipelines to connect subsea processing units directly to on-shore processing plants makes it likely that these will appear also in the future. Such developments are turning the spotlight on one of the biggest challenges for control and operation of offshore processing facilities and subsea separation units: controlling the feed disturbance to the separation process. That is, smoothening or avoiding flow variations at the outlet of the multiphase pipelines connecting wells and remote installations to the processing unit. Common forms of flow variations are slug flow in multiphase pipelines and casing heading in gas lifted oil wells. In both cases the liquid flows intermittently along the pipe in a concentrated mass, called a slug. The unstable behaviour of slug flow and casing heading has a negative impact on the operation of offshore production facilities. Severe slugging can even cause platform trips and plant shutdown. More frequently, the large and rapid flow variation causes unwanted flaring and limits the operating capacity in the separation and the compression units. This reduction is due to the need for larger operating margins for both separation (to meet the product specifications) and compression (to ensure safe operation with minimum flaring). Backing off the plant's optimal operating in this way reduces its throughput. A lot of effort and money has been spent trying to avoid the operational problems with severe slugging and reduce the effects of the slugs. Roughly speaking, there are three main categories of principles for avoiding or reducing the effects of slugs: Design changes Operational changes and procedures Control methodsA. Feed forward controlB. Slug chokingC. Active feedback control

AB  - ABSTRACT A method of eliminating severe slugging by implementing active control at open-loop unstable operating point is presented. This method overcomes the high back-pressure imposed on the riser-pipeline system by manual choking or some existing active control solutions using the riser top valve. Firstly, a simplified riser-separator model is developed by extending an existing simplified riser model. A relay auto-tuning approach is then developed for a slug controller to work at an open-loop unstable operating point, where the choking valve can open wider than manual choking so that overall production can be increased. The aforementioned tuning approach is successfully applied to the riser-separator model through simulation and demonstrated with the laboratory risers at Cranfield University. Simulation through a commercial multiphase simulator on an industrial riser system shows that the proposed approach eliminates severe slugging with increased oil production.

AB  - ABSTRACTSevere slugging formation was experimentally investigated in a two-phase flowloop which is composed of downwardly inclined pipe and vertical riser. A globe type valve was installed at the upper part of the vertical riser to control the flow rate and the gas was injected through the injection points in the horizontal section. When changing the gas-liquid ratio at the gas injection point, different type of slugging was observed, such as severe slugging, oscillation, and combination of both, were observed at the boundary between slugging and stable condition. Based on the observation, the stability map for the flowloop was developed to provide flow patterns under different ranges of superficial velocity of liquid and gas. Moreover, it was observed that when injecting gas at the point downstream of the liquid pump, the pressure of the flowloop showed a flow regime of dual frequency severe slugging, which is a combination of high frequency fluctuation and low frequency oscillation. When injecting gas through the other two points, only severe slugging fluctuation was observed, however the slug growth pattern was different depending on the superficial liquid velocity.The opening of the inlet valve was manually controlled to confirm that severe slugging was mitigated. A bifurcation diagram was made to more clearly identify which flow this system has at each valve opening. Bifurcation diagrams have been used to plot the values of pressure versus the values of valve opening for the slugging system. Valve opening at the point where the severe slugging flow changes to stable flow is expressed as critical valve opening. Experimental results show that severe slugging disappears at the opening below the critical valve opening, and that various critical valve opening values ranging from 0.3 to 0.7 are obtained depending on the liquid and gas flow rates. OLGA, a multiphase flow simulation software, was used to model the obtained experimental results. The simulation results showed the deviation for the amplitude of gas tank pressure was within 5% and the deviation for the period was within 10% under severe slugging formation.

AB  - SummaryExploitation of offshore petroleum reservoirs has recently moved to ever-increasing water depths. Production from fields in water deeper than 1800 m is now a reality. The use of long deepwater risers that conduct production from multiple wellheads on the seafloor to the surface predisposes the system to severe slugging in the riser for a wide range of flow rates and seabed topography. When one considers the length of the deepwater risers, the problem is expected to be more severe than in production systems installed in shallower waters. Severe slugging could occur at high pressure, with the magnitude of the pressure fluctuations so large as to cause a shorter natural flow period with subsequent consequences, such as premature field abandonment, loss of recoverable reserves, and earlier-than-planned deployment of boosting devices.In this study, a novel idea to lessen or eliminate severe slugging in pipeline/riser systems has been thoroughly investigated. This idea was first proposed by Barbuto1 and later developed independently by Sarica and Tengesdal.2 The principle of the technique is to transfer pipeline gas to the riser at a point above the riser base. The transfer process will reduce both the hydrostatic head in the riser and the pressure in the pipeline, consequently lessening or eliminating severe slugging by maintaining steady-state two-phase flow in the riser.An experimental study has been conducted with a 7.62-cm-inside- diameter (ID) riser (14.63 m high) and pipeline (19.81 m long) system. A broad range of data was collected from the facility in both the severe slugging and stable regions. It was found that the severe slugging models currently available do not predict the region accurately for larger-diameter pipes. Data acquired with the external gas bypass have proved the proposed elimination technique.IntroductionSevere slugging can occur in two-phase flow systems in which a pipeline segment with a downward inclination angle is followed by another segment/riser with an upward inclination angle. At relatively low gas and liquid flow rates, liquid can accumulate at the riser base of such a system, blocking the gas flow. This will result in an increasing liquid level in the riser until the liquid reaches the riser top. Simultaneously, gas in the downward-inclined section will be compressed. When the gas pressure in the pipeline has increased enough to counter the hydrostatic head of the liquid column, the gas will expand and push the liquid column violently out of the riser into the separator. Severe slugging will cause periods of no liquid and gas production in the separator followed by very high liquid and gas flow rates. The resulting large pressure and flow-rate fluctuations are highly undesirable; sudden surges in liquid production could cause overflow and shutdown of the separator. Fluctuations in gas production could result in operational and safety problems during flaring, and the high pressure fluctuations could negatively impact the field's production performance and ultimately lead to a reduction in recoverable reserves.Currently, there are three basic elimination methods that have been proposed - backpressure increase, gas lift, and choking. All other proposed techniques are based on these three methods.The backpressure-increase method eliminates severe slugging by increasing the system pressure, thereby significantly reducing production capacity.In gas lifting, external gas is injected into either the riser or the pipeline at the riser bottom to reduce the hydrostatic head in the riser or to increase the gas flow rate in the pipeline. Gas-lift equipment requires a large footprint on the platform and large amounts of gas to accomplish the elimination. The operational cost of gas lifting can be very significant.Choking increases the backpressure in proportion to the velocity increase in the riser. If the movement of the gas in the riser is stabilized before reaching the choke, steady flow will occur after a short flow period. The stabilization requires very careful choking to ensure minimum backpressure.Although there are several other methods proposed to eliminate severe slugging, their working principles are similar to or derivatives of the three methods described previously. Sarica and Tengesdal2 presented a literature review on the topic of severe slugging.Considering the dimensions of deepwater pipeline/riser systems, the severe slugging phenomenon is expected to be more pronounced, with a possible occurrence at considerably higher system operating pressures than in comparable production systems at shallower depths. Therefore, system design and the methodology used to control or eliminate severe slugging become very crucial when considering the safety of the operation and the limited space available on the platform. Moreover, the cost of a deepwater production/riser system is expected to be very high, and the remediation efforts of any reliability failures can be cost-prohibitive. Cost figures as high as U.S. $30 to 50 million for typical systems of 350- to 500-m water depths have been reported in the literature.3The applicability of current practices for predicting and eliminating severe slugging in deepwater developments is very much in question. Different techniques can be suitable for different types of problems and production systems. An assessment of the different, existing, applicable elimination techniques has been presented earlier by Sarica and Tengesdal.2Although different severe-slugging-elimination techniques are reported in the literature,2 none have been tested and verified for elimination of severe slugging in deep waters. Drastic differences in capital and operational expenditures among the different techniques have also been reported. Some of the promising concepts, such as foaming and self-lifting, are still conceptual and need to be developed and verified. In this study, the self-lifting concept has been thoroughly investigated.

AB  - Abstract We present a data-driven root cause analysis of slug flow in a subsea field. The asset experienced severe slugging in a riser, which limited production throughput. The results were used in combination with simulator studies and engineering experience to create a better understanding of the underlying root cause for slugging. A selection of signals was investigated as possible drivers behind slug severity. Focus was put on well-specific signals such as pressures, temperatures and flow rates, in addition to total flow rates, pipeline pressures and temperatures, and settings on the topside facility. Total liquid rate, especially the water component, is isolated as an important driver for slugging, while ruling out other signals believed to be important before the analysis, such as production from individual wells. The results were aligned with the field engineers’ experience. Actions were implemented to reduce water production, and this led to reduced slugging. Close collaboration between data scientists and field engineers was essential to guide the search towards actionable evidence. The novelty of this approach lies in utilizing machine learning techniques to model and analyze historical production data in order to find drivers behind events such as slug flow. This makes it easier for field engineers to leverage all available information to optimize production.

AB  - ABSTRACT:This paper describes the problems associated with severe slugging in two phase production flowlines from satellite wellhead platforms in St. Joseph field, Sabah, Malaysia. A brief theoretical analysis of the· problem is presented along with a description of the partial stabilisation measures taken to counter it and to restore well productivity on the satellite platforms involved. INTRODUCTIONThe existing St. Joseph field, offshore Sabah, Malaysia, was further developed over the period 1989 - 90 by the installation of two additional standard satellite wellhead platforms. The first of these, SJJT-G, was brought on stream in September 1990 and the second, SJJT-B, was brought on stream in October 1990. A field layout is presented in Figure 1. It was planned to produce both satellites through a common 10" diameter gathering line from SJJT-B, over SJJT-G to a central production station at SJP-A, delivering to the LP separator V-100A at that platform. With only SJJT-G on stream, no problems were encountered, manifold pressure at the SJJT-G wells was around 100 psig and the flow to SJP-A was steady. As a result of these problems, the two platforms experienced an average aggregate deficit of 6,000 bpd (approximately 20%) against planned production. This paper presents the symptoms and a brief analysis of the problem and describes a sequence of remedial measures which not only restored production to the planned level but boosted it to a higher rate. 2. Severe Slugging2.1 SymptomsThe main observations were: a) Pressure drop in the leg from SJJT-G to SJP-A fluctuated in the range 50 to 85 psi. Initial computer calculations had predicted around 20 psi in the horizontal section with negligible losses in the riser. It may be inferred that under severe slugging there is an additional pressure drop in the riser.

AB  - AbstractSevere slugging (SS) is an undesired multiphase phenomenon which occurs in riser-pipeline systems during the transportation of well fluids. It causes unfavourable instability in the fluid flow to the downstream separation facilities, resulting in detrimental effects to the separation/compressor trains; and in extreme cases can cause the shutdown of weak wells due to imposed additional backpressure.This work looks at a novel approach of using a compact separator, I-SEPTM, to mitigate SS in a passive manner. I-SEPTM has been shown to have a significant effect on stabilising the flow and has been compared to existing mitigation techniques showing a production benefit in a certain SS flow range.

AB  - Abstract Numerous studies on unconventional shale well production data have shown that downhole pressure fluctuations can exceed 300 psig during a slugging period. Such pressure fluctuation will result in very high drawdown and could lead to near-wellbore formation damage when the rock failure criterion was met. An engineering workflow was developed to investigate the impact of multiphase slugging events on cemented casing plug and perforation (CCPP)and open hole sliding sleeves (OHSS) completions. Based on transient pressure analysis and geomechanical evaluation, safety operational envelope was generated to minimize the risk of formation damage due to slugging behavior. In this study, a dynamic multiphase flow simulator was used to predict the pressure amplitude and frequency during the slugging events in both a CCPP and OHSS completion configuration. The results from the simulation were then incorporated into a geomechanical model to analyze and identify potential hydraulic fracture closure and formation damage concerns, which can compromise well performance. The results from this study show that OHSS completion is more vulnerable to damage during the downhole slugging period than a CCPP completion. However, severe formation and fracture damage could occur during downhole slugging for CCPP well if the well is operated outside the safety operational envelope. Results from the two case studies led to the conclusion that it is crucial to consider the effect of downhole slugging on near-wellbore fracture and formation integrity to avoid permanent and irreversible damage.

AB  - Abstract In recent times, studies on slugging have focused on the development of new and optimal slug mitigation techniques. This study focused on investigating a new proposed severe slug mitigation technique which involves combining self-lift and gas-lift. The self-lift slug mitigation technique is a unique approach that involves in-situ gas being tapped-off via a by-pass pipe along a pipeline upstream of a riser. The in-situ gas is then re-injected into the riser column via an injection point on the riser, to break liquid slugs within the riser column and mitigate severe slugging. This study adopted a methodology which involved validating the field data by comparing field pressure data with OLGA simulation based on input data from the field. The field case involved a deepwater oil field, consisting of well X1 and well X2 comingled along a 2712m pipeline section and a 1513m riser section. The pipeline-riser system in consideration in the case-study experienced hydrodynamic slugging, during the early life of the field; when the two wells comingled on the pipeline-riser system were operating at 3000 bbl/d. The 3000 bbl/d scenario (well X1 – 8.745 kg/s and well X2 – 25.13 kg/s) was initially modelled via OLGA. Furthermore, the 3000 bbl/d scenario was modified by moderating the flow rates at well X1 to 3.25 kg/s and well X2 to 12.13 kg/s until severe slugging scenario was observed, which was verified via pressure and holdup trend plots. Self-lift technique alone was able to moderate holdup within the riser column, however pressure trend at the riser column was observed to be over 20 bara (290.075 psi) which is the design pressure for the inlets of the separator. Further analysis of results obtained via the combination of self-lift and gas-lift at 2 inches by-pass diameter and 8kg/s gas-lift showed that pressure at the riser column was stabilized to approximately 20 bara (290.075 psi). This study showed that a by-pass internal diameter to pipeline-riser internal diameter ratio of (1 : 2) or less is crucial to the effectiveness of self-lift and gas-lift slug mitigation techniques combined. The new approach proposed in this study also has the potential of moderating the high compressive cost associated with gas-lift in deepwater scenario.

AB  - ABSTRACT Multiphase production systems face many challenges from the design to production phase. Transport of multiphase streams involve phase mixing, different flow patterns, mass transfer and, phase changes which make the system hydrodynamic very complex. All this complexity and chaotic state could lead to operational issues in the production and processing facilities; thus, it is very critical to understand what the expected behavior of the system is and how it would affect the production. In multiphase transporting systems, situations such as severe slugging in pipelines, risers, and receiving facilities can generate harsh transient events which could jeopardize the integrity of the system. Thus, this paper presents a multiphase assessment of an offshore production facility including its major component and a multiphase trunkline. The studied pipeline operates with three phases: oil, water, and gas; thus, flow patterns vary from stratified to severe slugging for some operating conditions and locations. A flow assurance study was conducted to improve the design and reliability of the off-shore transporting multiphase system. The study included a production development from an offshore production-separation platform which is located at approximately 55 miles offshore. The production of different wellhead platforms convey in the platform and then a multiphase stream is transported via a 30-in pipeline to a separation processing plant on-land. A detailed hydrothermal model of the entire system was developed and different operating conditions were evaluated considering the worst case scenarios for slugging and liquid accumulation. Different gas oil ratios were evaluated to determine the most optimum and safe operating conditions for the system based on a slugging analysis and severity scale. Slug severity statistics and system hydrodynamics were used narrow down critical conditions that should be avoided as well. This paper presents the methodology used in the assessments as well as the results obtained for the steady state and transient cases. In addition, some recommendations for improving the design and operation of the system are provided.

The transfer process will reduce both the hydrostatic head in the riser and the pressure in the pipeline, consequently lessening or eliminating the severe slugging by maintaining the steady-state two-phase flow in the riser. An experimental study has been conducted using a 7.62 cm. inner diameter riser (14.63 m high) and pipeline (19.81 m long) system. A broad range of data was collected from the facility both in the severe slugging and stable regions. It was found that currently available severe slugging models do not predict the severe slugging region accurately for larger diameter pipes. Data acquired with the external gas bypass have proven the proposed elimination technique. IntroductionSevere slugging can occur in two-phase flow systems where a pipeline segment with a downward inclination angle is followed by another segment/riser with an upward inclination angle. For such a system, at relatively low gas and liquid flow rates, liquid can accumulate at the riser base, blocking the gas flow. This will consequently result in an increasing liquid level in the riser until the liquid reaches the riser top. Simultaneously, gas in the downward inclined section will be compressed. When the gas pressure in the pipeline has increased enough to counter the hydrostatic head of the liquid column, the gas will expand and push the liquid column violently out of the riser into the separator. Severe slugging will cause periods of no liquid and gas production in the separator followed by very high liquid and gas flow rates. The resulting large pressure and flow rate fluctuations are highly undesirable; sudden surges in liquid production could cause overflow and shut down of the separator. Fluctuations in gas production could result in operational and safety problems during flaring, and the high pressure fluctuations could impact negatively on the field's production performance, and ultimately lead to a reduction in recoverable reserves. Currently, there are three basic elimination methods that have been proposed, namely, backpressure increase, gas lift, and choking. All other proposed techniques are based on these three elimination methods. The backpressure increase method eliminates severe slugging by increasing the system pressure, and thereby significantly reducing the production capacity. In gas lifting, external gas is injected either into the riser or pipeline at the riser bottom to reduce the hydrostatic head in the riser or increase the gas flow rate in the pipeline. Gas-Lift equipment requires a large footprint on the platform and large amounts of gas to accomplish the elimination. The operational cost of gas lifting can be very significant.

AB  - ABSTRACT This paper presents a new method for severe slugging mitigation in pipeline-riser systems. It describes the use of an injectable venturi coupled to the pipeline-riser system upstream of the choke valve before the topside test separator for severe slug attenuation and system stability. An injectable venturi is a venturi tube that has an opening at its throat and a pipe inclined at 45° is inserted into this opening. Thus, gas is injected counter to the flow coming from upstream of the injectable venturi to choke the working fluid passing through the throat of the venturi. Experiments were carried out in a 2" pipeline-riser system which comprises of a 40 m long horizontal pipe connected to an 11.75 m high S-shape riser followed by a 5.2 m horizontal topside section. The results of stability study showed that with an injectable venturi applied the system achieves stability quicker than without the injectable venturi. In addition, combining the injectable venturi with the choke valve to choke the pipeline-riser (bifurcation study) stabilised the system at higher valve opening and lower pressure compared to choking the pipeline-riser with the choke valve only. For the case studied (Vsl = 0.25 m/s and Vsg = 3.1 m/s), the critical valve opening (bifurcation point) for injectable venturi is 27% while that of pipeline-riser is 21% and their riser base pressures were 2.3 barg and 2.7 barg respectively. The low loss of energy due to the gradual change in geometry of the venturi may account for its ability to achieve stability at a lower riser base pressure. Thus, there was a 29% increase in valve opening and a 15% reduction in the riser base pressure. These practically imply an increase in oil production.

AB  - AbstractThe field developments in deep waters (>6000 ft) are becoming a reality. Severe slugging conditions might occur at considerably high reservoir pressures, and the magnitude of the pressure fluctuations can be significantly high causing premature abandonment and reducing the ultimate recovery of the field. Considering the length of the deep-water risers, the severe slugging is expected to be more severe compared to the production systems installed in lesser depths. Therefore, the design of downstream facilities at the platform becomes very crucial considering the safety of the operation and the limited available space on the platform.A novel technique is proposed to lessen or eliminate severe slugging in pipeline-riser systems applicable to all water depths. The idea is to transfer the pipeline gas (in-situ gas) to the riser at a point above the riser-base. The transfer process will reduce both the hydrostatic head in the riser and the pressure in the pipeline consequently lessening or eliminating the severe slugging. This can be considered as self-gas lifting (i.e., no gas injection is required). An existing severe slugging model based on one-dimensional drift flux formulation, has been modified to simulate the new severe slugging elimination method. The modified model has been verified by comparing it to the existing laboratory severe slugging data from several sources by selecting the transfer point as the riser base. IntroductionMost of the new discoveries of oil and gas reserves are expected to occur offshore. Since early 1960's offshore hydrocarbon discoveries and exploitation of them have been steadily increasing. With the current pace of technological advancement in exploration, drilling, production and transportation, the deep waters are seen as the new frontier. Production from deep-waters poses a host of new challenges ranging from reservoir management to flow assurance. Some of the challenges such as wax deposition, hydrate formation, multiphase pumping, and phase separation have been studied since late 1980's. Although, it has been identified as early as 1973, severe slugging phenomenon has not received much attention until late 1990's for the deep-water developments. Severe slugging can occur in such systems where a pipeline segment with a downward inclination angle is followed by another segment/riser regardless of the water depths. Severe slugging will cause periods of no liquid and gas production in the separator followed by very high liquid and gas flow rates. This phenomenon is very undesirable due to large pressure and flow rate fluctuations.The developments of fields in deep waters are in the horizon, although the current knowledge base has not yet been tested for deep-water risers and tiebacks. The applicability of the current practices in prediction and elimination of severe slugging to deep-water developments are very much in question. Severe slugging conditions might occur at considerably high reservoir pressures, and the magnitude of the pressure fluctuations can be significantly high eventually causing premature abandonment of the wells and reducing the ultimate recovery of the field. Considering the length of the deep-water risers, and the expansion capacity of gas due to very large hydrostatic pressures, the severe slugging is expected to be more severe compared to the production systems installed in shallower depths. Therefore, the design of downstream facilities at the platform becomes very crucial considering the safety of the operation and the limited available space on the platform. Moreover, the cost of a deep-water production riser system is expected to be very high, and the remediation efforts of any reliability failures can be cost prohibitive. Cost figures as high as $30 to $50 million for typical systems of 1150 to 1650 ft water depths have been reported in the literature6.

AB  - Abstract An experimental study of severe slugging suppression utilizing a combination of surfactants and gas-lift was conducted using a facility consisting of a 3-in. ID, 65 ft long, -3° inclined flow line followed by a 45 ft long vertical riser system.  Air and water were used as fluids.  The surfactant used was a foaming agent capable of forming stable foams in all brines for a wide range of pH.  Pressure behavior in the flow line – riser system was monitored and input gas, injection gas, liquid and surfactant flow rates were continuously measured.  In addition, visual observations were made to identify severe slugging.  Effects of the proposed method were quantified with a modified elimination performance index (MEPI) considering not only pressure fluctuations but also back-pressure effects.  A total of 30 tests were conducted.  The data were analyzed for the severe slugging suppression of the surfactant and gas-lift combination, the effect of gas lift on surfactant injection, and the effect of the surfactant on the reduction of the gas-lift gas.  The combination technique with the highest gas-lift rate completely eliminated the severe slugging for the all of the tests conducted.  Surfactants were able to suppress severe slugging for most of the cases.  The performance of “Only Surfactant Injection Case” increases as the gas-liquid ratio increases.  For all of the tests, back-pressure reduction was observed.  MEPI is used as the main parameter to assess the performance of the severe slugging suppression methods.  Gas-lift not only contributes with density reduction through volumetric increase of gas in the riser but it also reduces the mixture density by promoting more foam generation.  There were reductions in the gas-lift rate from the original maximum gas-lift injection rate for all the tests conducted with surfactant injection. Introduction The use of long deep-water risers that conduct production from multiple wellheads on the sea floor to the surface predisposes the system to severe slugging in the riser for a wide range of flow rates and seabed topography.  Considering the length of the deep-water risers, the problem is expected to be more severe than in production systems installed in shallower waters.  Severe slugging could occur at high pressure, with the magnitude of the pressure fluctuations so large as to cause a shorter natural flow period with subsequent consequences such as premature field abandonment, loss of recoverable reserves and earlier-than-planned deployment of boosting devices. Severe slugging will typically be experienced in two-phase flow systems where a pipeline segment with a downward inclination angle is followed by another segment/riser with an upward inclination angle for relatively low gas and liquid flow rates.  Severe slugging will cause periods of no liquid and gas production in the separator followed by very high liquid and gas flow rates.  The resulting large pressure and flow rate fluctuations are highly undesirable.  Several mitigation techniques are proposed in the literature.  A thorough summary of these techniques can be found in Sarica and Tengesdal (2000).  Surfactant application and gas lift are typically considered as separate methods.  The combination of both can provide a better mitigation of severe slugging by complementing each other.  As mentioned by Sarica and Tengesdal (2000), Yocum (1973) was the first to identify multiple severe slugging mitigation techniques.  These are reduction of the line diameter, splitting the flow into dual or multiple streams, gas injection into the riser, utilizing mixing devices at the riser base, choking, and back-pressure increase.  Here, we will classify severe slugging mitigation methods into three groups, namely, passive, active and hybrids (combination of both passive and active mitigation methods).

AB  - This article, written by JPT Technology Editor Chris Carpenter, contains highlights of paper SPE 191611, “Existence and Prediction of Severe Slugging in Toe-Down Horizontal Wells,” by Jayanth Nair, SPE, Eduardo Pereyra, SPE, and Cem Sarica, SPE, The University of Tulsa, prepared for the 2018 SPE Annual Technical Conference and Exhibition, Dallas, 24–26 September. The paper has not been peer reviewed. Severe slugging is an important flow-assurance issue, typically observed in offshore pipeline-riser systems. The consequences of severe slugging include flooding of downstream production facilities and an overall decrease in productivity. Severe slugging had been thought to be limited to systems with a downward-inclined pipeline and vertical, catenary, or lazy-S-shaped riser. This paper presents the results of an experimental and modeling study that demonstrates the existence of severe slugging in systems with upward-inclined lateral flow paths, such as a toe-down well. Introduction Severe slugging in offshore pipeline-riser systems with downward-inclined pipelines has been intensely studied because of its serious consequences. Most such studies are related to pipeline-riser systems, but the possibility of severe slugging in toe-up horizontal wells also was demonstrated experimentally in the literature. Toe-up wells are geometrically analogous to pipeline-riser systems because the lateral section in a toe-up well is a mostly downward-inclined flow path. However, there has been no documented evidence of severe slugging in systems with upward-inclined flow paths.  Facility Description A large-scale experimental facility was used in this study. This facility was designed primarily to study flow behavior in horizontal wells. The lateral section in the facility was 236 ft long and comprised 6-in. inner-diameter (ID) pipe, which acted as the casing. The curvature section was made of bent acrylic pipe and had a radius of curvature of approximately 18 ft. The vertical section was 34 ft high with 2-in. ID polycarbonate pipe simulating the tubing. The schematic shows a packerless configuration. In such a configuration, an additional volume was necessary to simulate the effect of an annular volume. This was achieved by adding a 37-ft-high, 6-in.-ID expansion volume. For cases where a packer was required, a solid plug was placed in the system to simulate the packer and the annular volume was disconnected. The end of the tubing location was varied by pulling the tubing or running the tubing deeper. The test fluids were air and water. Air and water entered the facility at the toe of the well. The mass flow rates were measured using flowmeters and were held constant during the tests. As the flow pattern developed along the lateral section, flowing pressures, temperatures, and pressure gradient were measured. Conductivity probes allowed the measurement of slug characteristics. The test facility also included several quick-closing valves. These valves were pneumatically operated and could capture the flow and measure holdup. When the flow reached the top of the vertical section, it returned to the water tank where the air was vented. A separate metering skid was used to inject gas in the tubing to study the effect of gas lift.

AB  - Abstract An experimental study investigating the effects of end of tubing (EOT) on the two-phase gas-liquid flow behavior in horizontal wells was performed. The experimental data were used to develop methodologies to determine the optimum EOT location for the observed flow types: stable and cyclic flows. Total pressure drop, liquid inventory and the two-phase flow hydrodynamic behavior were analyzed to determine the optimum EOT location criteria. Tubingless completion and four packerless EOT locations were tested using a transparent laboratory-scale flow loop facility resembling two horizontal well configurations: toe-up and toe-down with 1-in. tubing and 2-in. casing. Water and compressed air were used as test fluids with various constant flow rates under low pressure. Minimum total pressure drop in the well was used to determine the optimum EOT location for stable flow. Various total pressure drop vs. EOT location relationships were observed under different operating conditions. Under low gas flowrates, installing tubing may promote severe slugging (SS) for a toe-up system. EOT located at kick-off point may be preferred as it showed the least test number of points with SS behavior. In addition, this location generated the lowest liquid holdup in the tubing and backpressure to the lateral section in most cases. The observations to explain these findings and the comparison of the tested EOT locations in handling SS were discussed.

AB  - Abstract This paper presents the first comparison between two different injection methods for foam assisted gas lift. Useful information for operators and technology developers are also provided concerning chemical selection, testing, and deployment of this hybrid artificial lift technology in the field. The trials have been conducted in a gas lifted oil well with severe slugging and water cut above 50% (selection criteria as per SPE-184217-MS). The surfactant was delivered through a dedicated capillary injection string during the first trial, and the effects of surfactant concentration and depth of injection were evaluated. During the second trial, the surfactant was injected into the gas lift stream at the surface. Different surfactants were utilised for both trials based on stability concerns and method of injection. Both trialled injection methods successfully stabilized the well flow, terminating severe slugging while increasing the drawdown and delivering an increase in gross production of circa 200%. These results, together with the downhole pressure data collected during the first trial, confirm that the surfactant starts foaming only at the depth where the lift gas enters the tubing. Injecting surfactant into the lift gas stream required higher concentrations than using a dedicated injection string, difference attributable to the slightly different chemistry, but even at those higher concentrations an anti-foamer injection was not required. Concerning the response time, the well responded in 30 to 60 minutes with capillary string injection, while 6 to 12 hours were required for injection into the lift gas stream. This suggests that the surfactant probably moves slowly down on the annulus walls as a liquid film rather than travelling in droplets dispersed in the gas phase. Based on the outcome of the two trials, it is concluded that the injection via the lift gas stream is as effective as capillary string injection, at a fraction of the initial costs, with lower maintenance requirements, while still allowing access to the well.

AB  - Summary An experimental study of severe-slugging suppression by use of a combination of surfactants and gas lift was conducted with a facility comprising a 3-in.-inner-diameter, 65-ft-long, -3°-inclined flowline, followed by a 45-ft-long vertical-riser system. Air and water were used as fluids. The surfactant used was a foaming agent capable of forming stable foams in all brines for a wide range of pH values. Pressure behavior in the flowline/riser system was monitored, and input-gas-, injection-gas-, liquid-, and surfactant-flow rates were measured continuously. In addition, visual observations were made to identify severe slugging. Effects of the proposed method were quantified with a modified elimination performance index (MEPI) that considered not only pressure fluctuations, but also backpressure effects. Thirty tests were conducted. The data were analyzed for the severe-slugging suppression of the combination of surfactant and gas lift, the effect of gas lift on surfactant injection, and the effect of the surfactant on the reduction of the gas lift gas. The combination technique with the highest gas lift rate completely eliminated the severe slugging for all tests conducted. Surfactants were able to suppress severe slugging for most of the cases. The performance of the "only-surfactant injection case" increases as the gas/liquid ratio increases. For all of the tests, backpressure reduction was observed. The MEPI is used as the main parameter to assess the performance of the severe-slugging-suppression methods. Gas lift not only contributes to density reduction through volumetric increase of gas in the riser, but it also reduces the mixture density by promoting more foam generation. There were reductions in the gas lift rate from the original maximum gas lift injection rate for all the tests conducted with surfactant injection.

AB  - ABSTRACT: At constant inflow conditions, large-amplitude pressure and flow rate fluctuations may occur in a pipeline-riser system operating at relatively low liquid and gas flow rates. This periodic flow instability has been referred to as severe slugging. In this experimental study, three different orientation angles of the pipeline upstream of the riser base were investigated. The experiments were carried out in a downward inclined pipeline, in a horizontal pipeline and in a hilly-terrain pipeline followed by a vertical riser. Air and water were used as the experimental fluids. For each pipeline-riser configuration, different types of flow instability were found. 1 INTRODUCTION Pipeline-riser configurations in an offshore oil and gas production facility are required to transport multiphase hydrocarbons from a subsurface oil and gas reservoir to a central production platform. The diameter of the pipeline and the riser ranges from typically 0.1 to 0.8 m. The length of the pipeline can vary from a few kilometres to more than hundred kilometres. The height of the riser depends on the water depth, which can be more than two kilometres (in deepwater areas). At relatively low flow rates, liquid accumulates at the bottom of the riser, creating a blockage for the gas, until sufficient upstream pressure has been built up to flush the liquid slug out of the riser. After this liquid surge, and subsequent gas surge, part of the liquid in the riser falls back to the riser base to create a new blockage. This transient cyclic phenomenon is called severe slugging. Severe slugging can significantly reduce the production from the reservoir (due to an increased back pressure) and also can damage or even lead to a shut down of the platform facilities, downstream of the riser, like separators, pumps, and compressors.

AB  - AbstractThe Kuito FPSO and subsea production system offshore Block 14, Angola, was recently expanded to handle additional production from another area of the field. As part of the detailed design of the new production system, transient simulations using OLGA were performed to study the system's thermo-hydraulics behavior. This paper presents how OLGA, a transient multiphase flow simulator, was benchmarked using extensive production data from the existing Kuito production system and how the benchmarked OLGA models were used to perform the operability analysis of the new subsea production system. Transient operations, like planned shut-in and startup, unplanned shut-in and startup, blowdown, and pigging, were studied including issues associated with hydrodynamic and severe slugging. Particular attention was paid to how the new production system would interact with the existing production system during the transient operations. This paper will also present details on actual start-up of the new production system and the benefits transient simulation offered. IntroductionTransient simulations were used as part of the operability studies for the ChevronTexaco Kuito production system. The Kuito field, located in Angola Block 14, West Africa, is being developed in several phases. The A production center is the initial development of the field. The A subsea production center consists of 12 production wells around a 12-slot production manifold. The manifold is linked to an FPSO via two production flowlines and a test line. An umbilical system consisting of two gas lift/methanol umbilicals and one control umbilical supports production from the manifold. A new set of wells (the C center) was planned to be clustered in a manifold configuration similar to the A center. The manifold and the associated subsea distribution units will be tied back with an umbilical/flowline system to the existing Kuito FPSO. A tie-in module dedicated to the C center with all the necessary associated facilities such as pigging system, chemical injection, gas lift control and umbilical termination units will be installed on the FPSO. The Kuito fluids are semi-heavy with relatively low GORs. The A center flowline system is inclined downwards followed by a flexible riser. Thus, it is favorable for severe slugging to form in the system. The C center is located so that the flowlines will be inclined upwards to help mitigate slugs. To properly tie the C center into the existing FPSO, quite a few operational issues needed to be addressed. How will the C center production system interact with the A center? If one system is shutdown, will it adversely affect the other system? If slugging occurs with the C center system at early field life due to low production, will the A center production system be stable or unstable? All these operational issues were intended to be studied by using transient simulations. Transient multiphase flow simulators can simulate how the flow parameters, like pressure, temperature, liquid holdup and flowrates change with time. Thus, transient simulations are often performed to analyze system shutdown, re-startup, and blowdown, flowrate ramping, pigging, and other transient operations. OLGA is one of the most widely used multiphase flow simulators in the industry and OLGA 2000 was used for this work.

AB  - Abstract In a deepwater environment, production fluid conditions have to satisfy complex requirements to flow smoothly to the production facilities on the FPSO. Flow assurance specialists work at turning these constraints into operating guidelines. This allows to close the gap between reservoir conditions, optimized design of the subsea network, topsides processing capabilities and operability requirements. In the context of Kaombo, offshore Angola (Block 32), the wide range of reservoir conditions and fluids plus the extreme specificities of the subsea network called for an innovative approach with the following objectives: Empower the operator with a visual decision tool for normal and unplanned operations of the subsea system Promote collaboration between production, flow assurance & geoscience teams to reach an efficient decision, and minimize production shortfalls Allow a design robust enough to tackle geosciences uncertainties Optimize subsea design margins This new approach, the "Visual Operating Envelopes", aims at explicitly and visually defining the operating limitations of the subsea production loops in a multi-parameters environment: A multi-dimensions map, function of the six main parameters (basically liquid and gas-lift flowrates, water and gas contents, reservoirs pressure and temperature) influencing multiphase flow into pipeline is hence created to evaluate the six main operating constraints (thermal and hydraulic turndown rates, wells eruptivity, maximum flowrates) for the full range of Kaombo fields. This "operating envelope" tool can then define the minimum and maximum recommended flowrates for different operating conditions based on the following safe criteria: Arrival temperature above the Wax Appearance Temperature No hydrates risk during preservation No severe slugging effect Production below the flowline design flowrate Velocity below the erosional velocity In addition, the optimized gas lift flowrate is directly accessible, and the pressure available at every wellhead is compared to the backpressure associated to the operating point to assess the eruptivity of the wells. By having previously defined an overall operating envelope, it is extremely easy to evaluate quickly the impact of new operating conditions (due to degraded operating conditions, changes in reservoir parameters, modifications in the drilling and wells startup sequence), which makes this new approach very powerful and versatile. It also contributes to the definition of the production forecast during operation phase integrating reservoir depletion and available gas lift rate. Instead of relying on specific simulations for a limited number of cases, this innovative method defines a new approach where operating parameters are evaluated from the start, and boundaries are clearly identified, thus allowing to build a sound production profile for an extensive range of operating conditions. By doing so, system knowledge is improved, bottleneck conditions are anticipated, operators, flow assurance and geoscience teams are able to tightly collaborate and take smarter decisions together, resulting in more production. Eventually the method applied to a multiphase pipeline is actually transposable to every problem involving multi-dimensional inputs with combined constraints.

AB  - Abstract Single Point Gas Lift (SPGL) is preferred in subsea wells due to its certain advantages over conventional completion with unloading valves in meeting the aim for no intervention, pressure barrier requirements etc. Current paper presents a flow assurance study of an SPGL system in a deepwater field in India. The development strategy envisages clustered subsea wells with common flowlines connected to an FPSO about 12 km away. Requirement of gas lift is envisaged from mid-life due to expected depletion in reservoir pressures and increase in water cut. Subsea gas lift in deepwater environment typically requires higher injection pressure to lift from desired injection depth. The gas lift, flowline and riser system is expected to operate over a wide range of conditions in terms of fluid composition, pressure and flow rates. Optimum design and operation of an SPGL system under such conditions is a challenge. Integrated dynamic modelling from down hole to host facility at the pre-FEED stage can provide valuable inputs for system design and operability. The impact of various gas lift parameters like orifice size, setting depth, kick off pressure and operating injection pressure on the system has been studied. The field is having waxy crude with high pour point of 36°C with gelation propensity during long shut downs. The paper also brings out the operability windows during start up, turndown, shutdown, restart etc. and their impact on topside design. Transient modelling has been used to invetigate threats to system integrity due to high velocities of fluid through orifice, low temperature limits due to JT cooling, pressure surges into the production line resulting in large slugs arriving at FPSO. Slugging in riser may lead to process shut downs due to the pressure and rate variations resulting in loss of production. Design and optimization of the SPGL system is also aimed at increasing total production by avoiding process shut downs due to well instability and pipeline slugging.

AB  - Abstract Riser Base Gas Lift is one of several methods successfully deployed that can enhance production and suppress severe slugging. With few moving parts, it is a solution that can be accommodated into existing infrastructure with minimal upgrades on existing facilities while not being as maintenance intensive as other solutions. The flow assurance design is critical to successful implementation and this paper details this process through the means of a case study. The case study in question is a three well, deep water subsea tie-back. The subsea system consists of an 8" × 12" pipe-in-pipe round-trip piggable flowline loop which will experience severe terrain slugging. Riser base gas lift had been implemented with success on adjacent fields at this facility; therefore it was again selected for deployment. From a Flow Assurance perspective, design considerations discussed are: Optimum Injection Rate/Operating Range: Flowrate requirements that will effectively mitigate slugging and will not violate any operating constraints. Low Temperature Mitigation: Design against brittle material failure. Erosion Control: Assessment of droplet erosion. Production Chemistry: Design to prevent formation of hydrates/asphaltenes in the production system due to injection of gas. Testing/Benchmarking: Since system design is heavily dependent on the accuracy of simulation modelling, details of equipment flow tests to validate performance are discussed. Recommendations/Support to Operations: Development of standard operating practices associated with gas lift. Execution Issues: Detailing design adaptations to system changes during installation etc. Revalidation: Review of actual operational performance against design intent. For this field, a novel technological solution of a gas-lift umbilical riser was selected. This configuration provides the best balance of operability, reliability and cost. The operating philosophy uses a fixed subsea orifice /topside choke to control the gas flow (rather than the conventional variable subsea choke). The orifice will regulate the injection rate even as the system pressure varies due to slugging, allowing the umbilical to act as an accumulator that dampens the pressure variations and allows for a larger bandwidth and smoother operation. Ultimately this configuration is envisioned to be less dependent on operator interaction.

AB  - Abstract Since May 1991 a POSEIDON pump of the rotodynamic type has been running on the SIDI EL ITAYEM field in TUNISIA, logging more than 3500 operating hours (end of November 91) without a major problem. This pump is one of the practical results of the POSEIDON project, launched in 1984 by TOTAL, IFP and STATOIL, to develop the concept of multiphase pumping: the final target being a subsea multiphase boosting station. Prior to the Tunisian test, this pump had been Prior to the Tunisian test, this pump had been tested satisfactorily on the two phase loop of IFP at SOLAIZE (FRANCE), and it was this which decided the partners to send the prototype, without any modification, to the real active field test rig specially prepared to accommodate multiphase equipment. Introduction The choice of the multiphase pump type is the result of comprehensive knowledge and comparative studies of the different available or described pumping systems at commencement of the project pumping systems at commencement of the project The partners, not being bound to any particular pump manufacturer, only wished to select or to pump manufacturer, only wished to select or to improve a known product in order to have a tool available for their future subsea developments. In the following paper we will describe the different types of possible multiphase pumps and the reasons that lead the partners to the rotodynamic principle type. We will then present the POSEIDON pump, the tests performed on a diphasic loop to ascertain its behaviour with any composition of fluid, then the tests conducted in real field conditions at SIT and an intermediate conclusion about these operations that mark the end of the R and D phase. 2. MULTIPHASE PUMPS With the current low price for produced oil and the increasing cost of offshore operations it makes sense to use the declining fields separation capacities to receive the effluent coming from the smaller or marginal fields which do not deserve a conventional development. Also onshore fields located in remote areas or locations where it becomes more difficult to flare the produced gas or to build additional facilities are cases for using such pumps. The basic requirement to develop any field is that the wellhead pressure, may be, assisted by secondary recuperation means - water injection, gas lift - is enough to transfer the multiphase effluent through a single, multiphase pipeline. Otherwise, a pump is needed. pump is needed. A line will be mainly characterised by the flow rate (bbl/d), the composition of the fluid i.e the gas fraction GLR [gas to liquid ratio expressed as a percentage by volume (%) or as a ratio (m3/m3) in percentage by volume (%) or as a ratio (m3/m3) in suction condition], the pressure at the pump inlet and the pressure rise needed to enter the first stage of the separator at the end of the line. Secondary data will be PVT parameters such as fluid density, temperature, viscosity, water cut etc... Considering the above, the wide range of possible combinations must be emphasised, especially for the gas fraction that vary from zero in the case of a pure monophase fluid, to 95% for wells where a gas lift production is in use or if the produced gas has production is in use or if the produced gas has already reached high GOR, 100% being reached if there is severe slugging.

AB  - ABSTRACT As large, accessible gas and oil reserves become depleted , it is becoming increasingly more important to develop marginal fields that were once considered uneconomic. It is the responsibility of the design engineer to ensure this exploitation is both technically feasible and cost effective.One of the preferred methods to date has been the transfer of well fluids to a central 'production/processing' facility via a multi- phase pipeline. In this context multi-phase may not only be oil and gas but also water and solids, thus adding further complications to the understanding of fluid behaviour/characteristics and consequently the system design. The aim of this paper is to address some of the important process engineering design aspects of multi-phase flow systems specifically for use on marginal field developments. Typical examples of such aspects include:-The accurate prediction of flow regime, pressure and temperature drops, liquid holdups, hydrodynamic slugging in pipelines and severe slugging in risers; Hydrate formation and inhibition requirements; Waxing, emulsion, scaling, corrosion and erosion. Such information is vital for the complete design of the multi-phase pipeline, its capacity and associated process equipment. Our practical experience in this specific area, supported by examples from a selection of recently completed projects, are presented.The principal objective of this paper is to provide a platform to stimulate further discussion and give input from others' experience, and also provide a general overview of the critical issues that need to be addressed to achieve successful designs for such developments. INTRODUCTION With the gradual decline in the manageable reserves of existing fields, more emphasis is being placed on the development of smaller, leas accessible fields, which were once considered uneconomic.The size of these marginal fields minimise their ability to bear the cost of dedicated production facilities. This has motivated oil companies to invest heavily in the search for more economic methods for the exploitation of these undeveloped fields. Multiphase transportation can make marginal Fields economical and extend the life of existing platform production facilities.The transportation of gas and oil two base fluid or gas, oil and water (three phase liquid) simu1taneously in large diameter pipelines over relatively long distance required a detailed understanding of multiphase 1ow phenomena.It is the aim of this paper to briefly outline the important steps that should be followed prior to final design submittal, whilst highlighting indirect consequences of multiphase transportation.During the discussion we shall emphasise the importance of accurate steady state analysis covering the fundamental aspects of steady state multi-phase flow with typical examples to highlight the following:-pressure drop; temperature; liquid hold-up; hydrodynamic/terrain induced slugging , andsevere slugging in risersIn addition to the initial steady state analysis, this paper also aims to highlight the importance of considering transient phenomena when designing multi phase systems, addressing some of the more interesting effects of transient operation, including:-system start-up and shutdown; cool-down; andproduction upsets.

AB  - AbstractEfficient production of oil and gas generally relies on the use of specialty chemicals to prevent solids deposition, inhibit corrosion, and control fluid phase properties. While performance testing is an important step in selecting appropriate chemicals for such applications, the compatibility of the chemicals with materials used in the production system is critical to the successful implementation of any chemical treating program. Extensive formulation work, laboratory testing, and field verification are required to ensure that production chemicals will be compatible with system metals and polymers used in pumps, umbilicals, and capillaries. In offshore applications, particularly in deepwater where many components of the production system are not readily accessible, the systems compatibility of any production chemical is an essential part of the flow assurance process. This paper will focus on compatibility of production chemicals typically used in deepwater applications with system materials, and the deliverability of these chemicals through umbilicals and capillaries. Materials commonly used in deepwater installations were chosen, including mild steels, stainless steels, Nylon 11, elastomers, and thermoplastics. Standard test procedures including documentation were implemented. The results of a comprehensive study of corrosion, paraffin, asphaltene, hydrate and scale inhibitors will be discussed. Using material compatibility data for performance chemicals enhances the selection process for existing production, optimizes material selection and design in the development stage for new production, and facilitates formulation of new products.IntroductionIn May of 1999 it was reported that the deepwater Gulf of Mexico had been and continued to be a popular play for most oil companies.1 Yet there are significant obstacles that are introduced during production from deepwater depths. Most notably, there is the remote location of deepwater reservoirs. Water depths can exceed 4000 ft and offsets from the wells to the host platform have now reached 60 miles.2 This introduces two primary concerns: the difficulty and cost of subsea intervention, and the difficulty in supplying utilities (e.g., electricity, hydraulic fluids, oilfield production chemicals). The extreme water depths also can lead to severe slugging as the fluids are transported from the seafloor to the host platform. In addition, sea bottom temperatures in the Gulf of Mexico can reach as low as 36 - 40°F. These low ambient temperatures exacerbate the formation and deposition of hydrates and wax.To meet the unique challenge presented by the deepwater environment, several types of facilities have been developed, including: Tension Leg Platforms, subsea manifold systems, Spar systems, and Floating Production Systems.In subsea manifold systems, oil and gas production is transported to platform structures that may be many miles away through long mixed production flowlines. Oilfield chemicals are an important part of the development plan for subsea systems. Corrosion inhibitors, hydrate inhibitors, asphaltene, wax, and scale inhibitors are often needed to ensure a system's operability. Ensuring performance of these chemicals under expected system conditions is only the first step in qualifying a chemical for deepwater use. Other important considerations include materials compatibility (both metals and polymers), compatibility with system fluids and other production chemicals, stability at system conditions, rheology of products, and effects on downstream processing. This paper focuses on materials compatibility issues.

AB  - ABSTRACT Gas liquid slug flow can induce vibrations in process piping and large scale slugging can cause some oscillations of subsea flexible pipes. Pipe movements should be avoided, as fatigue can lead to pipe failure. Flow transients can also cause pipe failure, water slugs have lifted geothermal pipelines off support, and runaway hydrate plugs have caused fatalities. The flow - structure interaction is therefore of interest to study and to incorporate in dynamic simulators. Several cases of dynamic slug flow-structure interactions have been studied in small scale laboratory. A two way coupling has been established between a pipe structure model and a slug tracking model. A pigging case of a submerged flexible pipe is presented here. An initially liquid filled hose is hanging freely in a 4m long water tank. A pig is inserted at the inlet, and subject to a backpressure of air which drives the pig and the liquid out of the pipe. The subsequent pipe dynamics is video recorded and compared with the coupled flow-structure simulations. At high flow rates the initially U-shaped pipe rises above the water level and falls back to the surface. The experiments and the coupled models are described as well as key aspects of the numerical solvers.

AB  - Abstract Description Large fluctuations in gas and/or liquid production can lead to major disruptions on the topside facilities. These fluctuations are caused by the fluid composition, geometrical layout and operating conditions of the production system. With the current trends of: • Producing marginal gas/condensate and oil fields to existing facilities with subsea tie-backs, • Developing more deepwater fields, • Producing from existing production facilities towards the end of field life cycle, irregular production or slugging pipeline systems are observed more frequently. Therefore, slug mitigation techniques may achieve significant value impact on the business. The most recent technology in Shell for slug control is the Smart Choke. This technology consists of a single control valve that is installed between the riser top and the first stage separator. It is an active slug control device acting on gas and liquid surges without the requirement of phase separation upstream of the control valve. The basic control mechanism maintains a constant total volumetric flow at the system outlet. Furthermore, a detection algorithm is incorporated, which detects ‘liquid only' or ‘gas only' production. Based on this, the controller will switch between the different control modes for slug control. Additional to this flow controller, a slow valve position controller and a differential pressure override controller is used to ensure that the output of the volumetric flow controller remains in the range of the normal (or desired) operating valve position.

AB  - AbstractAccurate predictions of flow patterns for multiphase flow in pipes remain unresolved problems in petroleum engineering. Many problems in petroleum engineering. Many efforts have been directed towards improved understanding of the phenomena and the development of physical models that allow more accurate analytical predictions of the flow pattern transition boundaries in steady-state pattern transition boundaries in steady-state multiphase flow. The primary goal of such models is to provide a truly general method that predicts existing flow patterns, once the flow predicts existing flow patterns, once the flow rates, pipe geometry, and the fluid properties are specified. A unified approach, in which the same transition mechanisms can be applied over the whole range of inclination angle, has also been proposed. The most essential part of solving engineering problems that depend on flow pattern problems that depend on flow pattern predictions is the interpretation of results. The predictions is the interpretation of results. The ability to explore and manipulate the results using a computerized flow pattern simulator would greatly enhance an engineer's capability to optimize the design of multiphase transportation systems. This would also permit eliminating undesirable operating conditions; e.g. severe slugging at the riser in offshore operations. Progress in the area of Artificial Intelligence (AI) has made possible the partial realization of human decision making ability in a computer program. An intelligent program, supported by a knowledge data base, an inference engine, and human interaction, is an effective and economical solution for the present needs of advanced production present needs of advanced production optimization. A computer simulator is undergoing development, using a Knowledge Based System approach. The system attempts to imitate, and eventually replace, a multiphase flow engineering expert. The Expert System utilizes an inference engine which is based on analytical mechanistic models and the expertise of many multiphase flow engineering experts and consultants. It is capable of predicting the existing flow pattern based on the predicting the existing flow pattern based on the current design, and will offer advice on alternatives and the direction to proceed if the existing flow pattern is unacceptable, or potentially problematic. potentially problematic. Introduction A production system that includes both well string and pipeline sections is usually operated under multiphase flow conditions. In wells, even for the case of so-called "oil" or "gas" fields, pressure and temperature drops as the pressure and temperature drops as the produced hydrocarbons rise to the wellhead. produced hydrocarbons rise to the wellhead.

AB  - An Alternative Economic Method to Riserbase Gas Lift for Deep Water Subsea Oil/Gas Field Developments.AbstractThis paper presents the results of a new concept that can be utilized to replace a conventional riser base gas lift system with considerable added benefits in both capex and opex savings with simplified operational procedures and is particularly suitable for deep water oil/gas field developments. A riser base gas lift system is normally incorporated within a subsea field development to (1) minimise unstable pressure and flow fluctuations resulting from normal and or low flowrate production conditions (2) minimise severe slugging due to a combination of riser configuration and production flow hydrodynamics (3) minimise back pressure on wells through the reduction of static pressure head and start-up instability.The utilization of a riser base gas lift system for deep water fields poses a number of technical problems such as low temperature effects resulting from Joule-Thomson cooling of the gas across the control valves/chokes in the system and require hydrate inhibition. These requirements add to the complexity and operational risk of the riser base injection and control system.The concept presented overcomes these technical issues through operational procedures developed through the application and understanding of multiphase transient behaviour and control with an added benefit of considerable cost reduction. This paper presents the application of this concept and the associated technical analysis based on modeling of transient multi-phase production operational modes. The proposed concept system can be employed in deepwater field developments.The proposed system removes the need for a dedicated and complex riser base gas lift system of flexibles and risers, gas transport tubing and associated equipment by using a multiphase riser base lift system method. Comparative economic analysis has shown the potential for significant CAPEX savings (circa 5,000,000) with additional saving from a reduced chemical injection and heating system.IntroductionOil and Gas field developments especially in deeper waters that tie back to a receiving facility can experience unstable production pressure and flows. The use of a riser base gas lift system is one method of providing production stabilization. In general, riser base gas lift is beneficial for (1) stabilizing production conditions during severe slugging operating under both normal and system start-up in the pipeline/riser system, (2) minimizing slug sizes arriving on topsides process vessels i.e. slug catcher/separator, (3) reducing the static head in the riser and hence back pressure on the well/reservoir to improve productivity and enable stable start-up after a hot oil flushing operation e.g. when the flowline riser system is completely full of liquid and (4) minimizing pressure fluctuations at the wellhead (and hence downhole) resulting from flowline/riser instability. The main problems, however, associated with operating riser base gas lift systems in deep water developments are the resulting low temperatures at the injection point and the impact on the pipeline material and produced fluids (e.g. hydrates formation and wax deposition). To avoid low temperatures, heating of the lift gas is required, which in turn puts additional demand on the vessel's power supply and requires additional equipment allocation.Riser base lift gas requirement studies conducted during the parallel engineering phase of BP's Foinaven fast track deep water oil/gas field development project showed little benefit of riser gas in reducing slug sizes and associated gas surge rates.

AB  - Problematic performance of traditional pumping equipment in unconventional plays has led to an increased focus on obtaining a better understanding of multiphase flow behavior through horizontal wellbores. A collaborative test campaign was initiated so that improved production technologies may be developed. Measurement of the impact of gas slugging on lift system performance was identified as the primary goal of the testing. A test well with significant gas slugging was produced using the latest ESP gas handling technology introduced to the industry. The system was fitted with two sets of hi-fidelity flow measurement sensors, capable of measuring gas holdup and flow regime in real-time as the well was produced. The first set of flow sensors was installed below the pump, and the second set of sensors was installed around the heel of the well extending into the lateral portion. A subsequent test was conducted with experimental completion hardware designed to avoid the uptake of gas slugs. The production results and lessons learned from lifting oil and gas from an unconventional well will be discussed, including gas lift, newly introduced gas handling ESP technology, and experimental ESP completion hardware. New understanding of fundamental multiphase flow behavior through horizontal wells will be presented. Phenomena observed in laboratory experiments will be compared against field test measurements. Analytical models for characterizing gas slugging behavior, calibrated against field test measurements, will be discussed.

AB  - AbstractWhen a process engineer is asked to design transportation and treatment facilities or to recommend operating procedures, he needs to run steady state and transient multiphase flow computer programs. The predictions regarding steady state two-phase flows of the mechanistic models OLGA, TACITE and TUFFP have been assessed in a previous SPE paper (ref. 1). As a logical continuation, the performances of these models regarding transient two-phase flows are compared in this paper first on transient loop data and then on field data. The main features of each model are presented as well. From the analysis of the features and the performances of the three codes, some guidelines to improve each model are indicated.IntroductionFormerly, people used to run steady state empirical correlations for the design of multiphase production system including well, pipeline and downstream facilities. But it appeared very quickly that such correlations could be used only in the case of wells or pipelines similar to the ones the correlations were derived from (same diameter, same profile and same fluids).Since the early 1980's, with the coming of a number of mechanistic models onto the market (PEPITE, WELLSIM, OLGA, TUFFP), people know that it is less risky to use steady state mechanistic models to design the multiphase production systems. Given the inlet and the outlet pressures as well as the gas and liquid flow rates, these steady state models are reliable enough to figure out the right diameter. But when it comes to designing facilities downstream of a pipeline in which flow rates can change fast, these models often prove inadequate.They are incapable of even predicting the flow rates at the pipeline outlet when the inlet flow rates are low enough to give rise to such well-known phenomena as terrain slugging or severe slugging. The only way to deal with these highly varying outlet flow rates and consequently to design properly the facilities downstream of the pipeline is to use transient flow simulation models. Among such models we have tested OLGA, TUFFP and TACITE.The three programs were compared first against loop data and next against field data. The advantage of data measured on a loop is that the fluid properties and the flow rates are known precisely. If discrepancies exist between the measures and the predictions, only the hydrodynamic model can be called into question. For the code developers, this is a first step needed to establish confidence before pursuing with the comparison against field data. Such a comparison is required by any potential user of a model to get him to trust the program in his turn.Data from the loop set-up within the frame of the Tulsa University Fluid Flow Project were used for the comparison. This loop will be briefly described here-after.Specific measurement campaigns were conducted on a number of real pipelines operated by Elf Exploration Production and Total to acquire relevant transient flow data necessary to test any transient flow simulation program. Among them, we have selected one pipeline with very severe changes in the inlet flow rates.As expected, none of the three programs can predict perfectly all the transient flow conditions. From the analysis of the main features of the models on the one hand and from the analysis of the conditions where the discrepancies are the largest on the other hand, the authors will try to make clear some areas where improvements are needed.Data descriptionLoop data. The data have been acquired on the test loop set up in the frame of the Tulsa University Fluid Flow Project (TUFFP). The test facility (fig. 1) is described by Minami (ref. 2). It is a 420 m long, 77.9 mm diameter horizontal steel pipeline that uses air and kerosene as working fluids. It is operated at atmospheric pressure.P. 631^

AB  - Abstract A theoretical and experimental study of a normal (hydrodynamic) slug flow in a pipeline-riser pipe system is presented in this paper. Experimental flow visualization revealed that long hydrodynamic slugs generated in the pipeline do not dissipate in the riser pipe. It was shown that slug dynamics in the riser pipe is controlled by two phenomena: the gravitational forces and the compression of gas in the trailing bubble. It was found that slugs can accelerate in the riser to a velocity more than five times exceeding the average slug front velocity in the flowline. The results obtained can be used to define operating strategies for offshore production facilities with large diameter flowlines. Introduction Slug flow is a common problem in the operation of offshore petroleum production facilities. Long (Ls>>D) slugs generated in a flowline (with multiphase mixtures) can cause difficulties in the operation of the gas and liquid processing plant (excessive liquid levels in the first-stage separators, a decrease in the efficiency of separators, and pressure variations at the compressor inlet). Slugs can also cause pipe vibrations at bends (or T-junctions) and damage the separator internals. Although considerable progress has been made in understanding slug flow in pipelines, many important issues remain unresolved. Most previous studies have focused either on modeling the slug dynamics in horizontal and hilly terrain pipelines1-8 or on severe slugging in a pipeline-riser pipe system.9-12 Little attention has been paid to studying normal (hydrodynamic) slug flow in a pipeline-riser system. Schmidt et al.13 studied experimentally slug flow in a 2-in. pipeline-riser system in which the height of the vertical riser was much larger the slug length. The separator in their experimental facility was located at the same level as the pipeline. The riser was connected to the separator using a downcomer pipe, so pressure at the riser outlet was not controlled. Miyoshi et al.14, developed a hydrodynamic model of an offshore gathering system consisting of a pipeline, riser pipe, and slug-catching separator. Based on this model they studied the influence of the riser-pipe height and the slug length on separator performance (mostly, on the gas and liquid flow rates at the separator inlet and outlet). Large diameter flowlines (with i.d. of 20 in. or larger) are commonly used in the offshore production of high-GOR oil. To avoid problems caused by slug flow, the operator increases the pressure in the flowline until the flow in it becomes stratified. This is usually achieved by throttling the flow at the riser outlet. However, an increase in the flowline pressure results in an increase in well back-pressure. Lowering well back-pressure is one of the methods of increasing the oil production. Hydrodynamic slugs in large diameter flowlines can be very long, so for the successfull use of this method an analysis must be performed to estimate the influence of the slug flow on the operating conditions and the mechanical integrity of the production system. In this work, normal slug flow in a pipeline-riser pipe system is studied theoretically and experimentally. The model proposed by Schmidt et al.13, was extended to simulate long hydrodynamic slugs (Ls > Hr). Simulations are presented of slug motion in a system consisting of a 3-in. pipeline, 2.8-m high vertical riser and a separator in which pressure is maintained constant. The influence of slug length on the pipeline pressure variations is examined. A description of the experimental facility used for this study is given, and the preliminary results of flow visualization are discussed.

AB  - AbstractBy using a full dynamic model for both the well and the near well reservoir, a large range of instabilities can be simulated. These instabilities include gas lift heading, severes slugging and compressibility effects. To simulate these types of fluctuations it is necessary to use an integrated dynamic model for the complete system. Using a constant productivity index to describe the inflow or using lift curves for the well are not sufficient to capture the dynamics. In this paper a well is described where reservoir-well interaction leads to unstable well behaviour. In order to investigate the cause for the unstable production a full dynamic model was developed for both the well and the near well reservoir. The simulation results are compared to field data of this well. The instabilities encountered at this well were explained by a combination of severe slugging in the well and the influence of the dynamics of the reservoir. The wellbore could act as a gas storage volume in which a pressure build up can take place. The well model used was a three phase dynamic models based of the drift flux formulation. For the reservoir basic single phase oil model was used to simulate a radial inflow. In the reservoir the compressibility of the oil is taken into account.IntroductionMost oil and gas wells become unstable during the production lifetime. These instabilities are generally undesirable as the large fluctuating oil, water and gas rate at the wellhead will result in a fluctuating load on the surface equipment. This will in practice limit the average production and the ultimate recovery. Therefore, it is preferable to stabilize the production rates. However, in practice the instabilities can arise from a multitude of causes. Well-known sources are the occurrence of gas lift heading and slug flow. Lesser known instabilities arise from the interaction between the well and the reservoir. This can occur when a gas or water cone breaks through. Besides the dynamics of oil inflow due to the compressibility of oil can cause unstable well performance. In this paper, some of the sources are discussed. This will be done based on field data of an unstable well. The objective of the study was to investigate different sources of instability and to evaluate the conceqences for the performance of the well. The goal of the project is to increase the ultimate recovery of a well by controlling the inflow and thereby increasing the operation range. In this paper we focus on the stability analysis of the well-reservoir system and less on the controllability. For this analysis, a dynamic well simulation model is used, which can be coupled to a dedicated reservoir model. The reservoir models can range from a simple volume, to a complex gas-oil-water model. In the results presented in this paper, the reservoir model is restricted to near well reservoir models. Hereafter a basic description of the well is given and the encountered instabilities are discussed. Then the model is described in more detail. The steady state simulation results are used for a first analysis of the model. Then the different instability sources are investigated. The pressure levels and frequency obtained from simulating the various types of instabilities are compared to measured data.Well and reservoir descriptionThe well under consideration is a well with a total length of 3150m (see Figure 1). The horizontal section of the well is approximately 550m long. The perforated section is 600m long. This section is an open bore hole protected only with a sandscreen. The well produces from a homogenous sandstone reservoir (50 mDarcy). The production zone has a thin oil layer with a current approximate thickness of 20m.With the large height difference in true vertical depth of the horizontal section this means that some sections of the perforations are in or near the water layer. Originally there was no gas cap, but as the reservoir pressure decreased, small gas caps have been detected close to the well bore. The well is equipped with a gas lift injection point at an axial position along the tube of x=2250m. This gaslift is operated with a choked injection valve. The injected mass flow is therefore constant. One downhole pressure gauge is available at x=2270m.

AB  - SPE Member AbstractA model has been developed to optimize sizing the staging and brake horsepower requirements for an electrical submersible pump (ESP) in a solution-gas-drive horizontal well. Three components are examined by the model, reservoir inflow performance, casing and tubing outflow performance, and pump performance. Since severe gas slugging has been a characteristic of many horizontal wells, the g as slugging potential is monitored during the pressure traverse from potential is monitored during the pressure traverse from where the fluid flows into the well bore to the pump set depth. flexibility for handling the gas at the pump intake has been included. The model can take into account the gas removed by a gas separator and the gas produced up the annulus. Actual data provided from horizontal wells producing with electrical submersible Pumps has been used producing with electrical submersible Pumps has been used to verify the model's relative accuracy in sizing. IntroductionOld oil fields which still have enormous potential for production of hydrocarbon reserves are being given a second production of hydrocarbon reserves are being given a second chance through horizontal drilling. The advent of new technology for horizontal wells and the subsequent increased drilling activity have brought new challenges to artificial lift methods also. The expense of drilling and completing a horizontal well justifies a vast amount of planning before the well is spud. One contingency that should definitely be planned in a horizontal well is artificial lift. This work, although specific to sizing electrical submersible pump systems in solution-gas-drive horizontal wells, has pump systems in solution-gas-drive horizontal wells, has components which could be applied to other forms of artificial lift. The model is in the form of a computer program developed to run on a personal computer. It was developed in partial fulfillment of the requirements for the degree of Master of Science. The production system is divided into the inflow performance relationship (IPR), the casing and tubing, or outflow performance, and the pump performance. The IPR equations used for horizontal wells by the model are relatively new, and this model has been a proving ground for their practical application. Gas slugging is a familiar phenomenon in many horizontal wells. It can cause an electrical submersible pump to gas lock and to shut down. The model predicts two types of gas slugging while evaluating the pressure profile of the horizontal section of the dog leg. The casing size and the inclination angle of the horizontal section of the well can have a definite influence on this slugging potential. The model can be used on an existing well to optimize the flow rate, operating frequency, set depth, and well head pressure for production with the least amount of downtime from gas production with the least amount of downtime from gas interference; or, it can be used to plan a well by optimizing the casing size and inclination angles to minimize the gas slugging potential. The model will suggest a particular pump or set of pumps and the appropriate staging to produce a desired surface flow rate of fluid. It will also determine the required brake horsepower for the pump and gas separator to do the job. However, this information is useless if the equipment will not fit through the dogleg to the desired set depth. A number of petroleum companies before they drill the horizontal well are now sizing ESP equipment to go down into the horizontal section under the worst possible producing conditions. Computer analysis is available to determine the dogleg degree of severity limitations the drilling company will have to adhere to in order to get that equipment through the dogleg if it becomes necessary. This planning ahead eliminates a great deal of frustration. Planning a tangent in the dogleg and/or a flat segment at the beginning of the horizontal section where ESP equipment can be set without operating in a bind is also recommended. Case studies indicate that the model is a capable and effective tool for sizing an electrical submersible pump in a solution-gas-drive horizontal well. P. 165

AB  - Abstract An experimental program was carried out to support the application of riser-base gas injection for deepwater production risers. The experimental equipment consisted of a 40 ft-tall, 11?? ID vertical riser connected to a 25 ft-long flowline section of the same inside diameter. The motivation for this work was the significant uncertainty that exists as to the behavior of vertical gas-liquid flow in large diameter pipes. Scarce published information exists for such flows and no known records of flow regime observations are available from the published literature. Riser-base gas-lift has been identified by various deepwater project teams as a key operability element that can address three major project objectives: a)flow assurance requirements necessitate the evacuation of the riser during an extended shut-down by using injection gas. As a result of riser evacuation, the hydrostatic pressure at the base of the riser is reduced to a level below the pressure required for hydrate formation at the ambient seawater temperature of between 37 and 40 F, b)production economics for many deepwater projects relies on riser-base gas-lift as an artificial lift method and, c)riser-base gas injection will be necessary for alleviating severe slugging problems in deepwater flowline-riser systems. In order to verify the ability of gas-lift to fulfill the stated objectives for large diameter risers, a variety of air-water flow tests were carried out in the 11?? transparent riser system built at Shell's Houston Technology Center. The flow tests included transient and steady-state gas-liquid flow and flow regime visualization. Measured riser pressure drop data were used to compare with 1-dimensional flow model predictions. Serious model limitations were found as the models failed to accurately capture "churn flow?? effects that appeared to dominate over the range of conditions studied. Steady-state pressure drops were underpredicted by more than 25%. Riser evacuation predictions indicated continued liquid removal whereas the data showed that liquid is expelled as an initial slug with no additional carry over. To overcome the shortcomings of 1-dimensional models, rigorous analyses using Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) simulations were performed. A full 3-dimensional CFD model of the flowline-riser system was used in FLUENT with the volume of fluid (VOF) method to predict both steady-state and transient behavior. In all cases simulated, CFD results compared well with the experimental data.

AB  - Abstract It is difficult to control and to manage wells’ start-up in offshore platforms. In order to solve this problem an intelligent system can play an important role, since available qualitative operator and design knowledge can be easily implemented to assist the operator during wells’ start-up. This paper describes the integration of an expert system associated with anti-slug control for well start-up. The intelligent system has many heuristic rules to implement the automation of the start-up procedures, like the opening choke valve while simultaneously respecting many constraints. Severe slugging flow regimes are one of the major disturbances for the operation of offshore production platforms, and can cause many unplanned shutdowns. Therefore, it’s important to combine start-up intelligent system with an anti-slug advanced control module for each well. The benefits are associated to reducing possibility of unplanned shutdowns during well start-up operational procedures, decreasing operators’ stress and also helping to minimizing impacts to the environment. A prototype was implemented in one platform with good results for a safe and efficient wells start-up procedure. This paper will present the development and results of this intelligent system for wells’ start-up and anti-slug control for offshore platforms.

AB  - Abstract:An approach to model slug flow in pipelines and pipeline-riser systems is presented which is based on a transient Lagrangian formulation. This method is particularly useful for slug flows approaching the end of a pipeline or for predicting the influence of a riser pipe to the production system. The flow is modelled by considering a series of slug units, each consisting of a ''liquid'' slug and its associated ''gas'' bubble, being continuously introduced into the system at a fixed location considerably remoted from the system outlet. The flow parameters are predicted as the slugs traverse the system. There are of course interaction effects between successive slug units and outlet effects (disturbances) can be transmitted upstream. Liquid hold-up in the ''liquid'' slug and ''gas'' bubble is accounted for as gas compressibility. It is assumed that there is no mass transfer between phases. To validate the approach used, the model was tested against a homogeneous flow condition with a steady air - water flow system. Results are also presented for trains of slug units negotiating the pipeline riser pipe system. IntroductionThe presence of slug flow in a transportation pipeline can be particular troublesome. This steady state models which consider, to a greater or lesser extent, the details of the flow of individual slugs. However Brill et al [5) have presented correlations based on anaIysisof data obtained from the Prudoe Bay pipeline in Alaska. In relatively short horizontal lines it has been established that for steady conditions liquid slug length of the order of20 -25 pipe diameters can be expected (normal slug flow). However, in long undulating pipeline - vertical riser system, large slugs have been shown to occur. When slug lengths are greater than the height of the riser this is often termed as severe slugging.

AB  - ABSTRACTControl systems that prevent the development of riser slugging in pipeline-riser systems have in recent years been introduced on several offshore processing facilities. These control systems are based on active use of the topside choke valve to keep a pressure measured somewhere upstream of the riser constant. These control systems have been a great success, and are emerging as the standard method to avoid riser slugging in multiphase production pipelines.The active use of the topside choke valve for control purposes opens the door for several other interesting applications as there are other multiphase phenomena occurring in a pipeline-riser system that can cause operational problems for the downstream production facilities. Among these are surge waves. When the production rate in a gas-condensate pipeline is increased, the liquid holdup in the pipeline will go down. This means that during the transition period, an excess amount of liquid needs to be transported out of the pipeline before a new steady state can be reached. The excess liquid can cause the liquid rate out of the pipeline to exceed the liquid handling capacity of the receiving facilities. Start-up slugs occur when the pipeline is started up from shut-in conditions. These slugs are similar to surge waves as they are caused by an increase in the production rate. However, start-up slugs can be even more violent as they potentially can initiate riser slugs and thereby cause even larger peaks in the liquid production.In this paper we introduce a novel control structure that extends the scope of pipeline control by including suppression of surge waves and start-up slugs. The control system consists of a slug controller and individual flow controllers for each phase combined seamlessly through a minimum select function. The performance of the control system is illustrated with simulations from an industrial case study.

AB  - Liquid accumulation in deviated gas wells is a major challenge in production systems. Limitations with the use of gas lift, pumping or plunger lift methods add to this challenge. Recently, surfactants have been injected continuously or as batch to help with the well deliquification by foam generation. The batch treatment is done by intermittent application of soap sticks or liquid surfactants. This study is an effort to characterize surfactant batch treatment as an artificial lift method in horizontal gas wells. Given the practical potential and yet limited number of studies on this topic, the results can provide an experimental source to optimize surfactant application in mature production systems. The experimental study is performed in a 2-in ID facility consisting of a 64-ft lateral section with 1° downward inclination followed by a 41-ft vertical section. Water and compressed air are the liquid and gas phases, and an anionic surfactant is applied in batches at the heel of the well. First, static tests are conducted to analyze surfactant efficiency in well start-up conditions. The surfactant concentration, initial liquid loading level and gas rate are varied, and the final liquid loading volume is measured as the target parameter. Then, dynamic tests are conducted to mimic the flowing well conditions. Surfactant concentration, liquid and gas flow rates are varied, and pressure fluctuations at the toe are monitored with time. The surfactant batch is delivered after air-water flow stabilization to investigate the surfactant efficiency. In addition, a high speed camera is used to record the flow conditions. For well startup conditions, surfactant batch treatment is most effective for lower gas flow rates. Furthermore, the efficacy of surfactants is more pronounced at lesser-loaded wells. The effect of increasing surfactant concentration is eminent below the critical micelle concentration (CMC) with no further improvement beyond CMC. Generally, surfactant batch treatment does not significantly improve well cleanup time. During well production, surfactant batch treatment is most efficient in low liquid and gas flow rate systems. At increased liquid and gas flow rates, with increasing surfactant concentration, its use can be inefficient due to adverse effects caused by foam frictional pressure losses. When the surfactant batch treatment is efficient, its effect increases with increasing concentration until CMC is reached. During severe slugging, surfactant batch treatment eliminates the slug production phase and partially or fully eradicates the severe slugging depending on the severity of the slugs. Generally, no significant trends can be observed between the period of effectiveness and concentration of surfactant.

AB  - Riser Base Gas Lift is one of several methods successfully deployed that can enhance production and suppress severe slugging. With few moving parts, it is a solution that can be accommodated into existing infrastructure with minimal upgrades on existing facilities while not being as maintenance intensive as other solutions. The flow assurance design is critical to successful implementation and this paper details this process through the means of a case study. The case study in question is a three well, deep water subsea tie-back. The subsea system consists of an 8" × 12" pipe-in-pipe round-trip piggable flowline loop which will experience severe terrain slugging. Riser base gas lift had been implemented with success on adjacent fields at this facility; therefore it was again selected for deployment. From a Flow Assurance perspective, design considerations discussed are: Optimum Injection Rate/Operating Range: Flowrate requirements that will effectively mitigate slugging and will not violate any operating constraints. Low Temperature Mitigation: Design against brittle material failure. Erosion Control: Assessment of droplet erosion. Production Chemistry: Design to prevent formation of hydrates/asphaltenes in the production system due to injection of gas. Testing/Benchmarking: Since system design is heavily dependent on the accuracy of simulation modelling, details of equipment flow tests to validate performance are discussed. Recommendations/Support to Operations: Development of standard operating practices associated with gas lift. Execution Issues: Detailing design adaptations to system changes during installation etc. Revalidation: Review of actual operational performance against design intent.   For this field, a novel technological solution of a gas-lift umbilical riser was selected. This configuration provides the best balance of operability, reliability and cost. The operating philosophy uses a fixed subsea orifice /topside choke to control the gas flow (rather than the conventional variable subsea choke). The orifice will regulate the injection rate even as the system pressure varies due to slugging, allowing the umbilical to act as an accumulator that dampens the pressure variations and allows for a larger bandwidth and smoother operation. Ultimately this configuration is envisioned to be less dependent on operator interaction.

AB  - Abstract The original gas lift valve testing method which has been proposed by South West Research Institute, SWRI, is very slow and expensive. The current API testing method is based on the API RP 11 V2 procedure. This testing method is not sufficient for all the gas valves purposes. On the other hand, the gas valves just calibrated at the manufacturer based on the API code which may not satisfy the application at all because the calibration is in static conditions whereas the valve is working under dynamic modes. Application of this work is to test and calibrate the gas valve based on the best performance and efficiency at the wellbore location. This method which is based on concept of pressure decay is really unique, novel, and inexpensive. It can be carried out at the wellbore location. This method is able to determine the actual flowing area, stem travel, discharge coefficient, and load rate of valve during flowing conditions. The significant section is that this method will correct the API standards of calibrating for different applications which is a great progress in this field of action. Introduction Artificial lift comes to the play when the production of oil (formly water) is not done through natural well flow. Blow down can be useful for low water-cut systems.1 Gas lift often can enhance the low GOR reservoir performance. Apparently, with increasing GOR, gas lift becomes less effective. So, the need for gas lift is related to the GOR prediction. Gas lift is performing useful in deep water with long offset flowlines. The reason is because of reducing the chance of slug formation. The reason behind it is because of severe slugging occurrence the relatively low production rates which make the gas lift a must at the beginning. Blowdown technique is more limited in downhill flowlines rather than uphill flowlines. In this system gas is continuously injecting through the casing or tubing and push the pass through some valves located in designated places and lift the volume of the liquid above. In this process, the gas lifts a slug of liquid each time. Setting the gas lift valves, GLV, is critical to the production. The GLVs should be set based on their initial opening pressure decreasing from surface level to the sandface, meaning when the top valve is getting ready to open; all the valves below are open. Selecting the GLVs port sizes and the distance between them as well as the initial opening pressure of each valve should be calculated and adjusted accurately to get the aimed results. The GLV is the most important component in such a design. The nitrogen-charged bellow pressure in the GLV may changes due to the temperature change from the surface to the bottomhole which should get calibrated and corrected before each installation for the best performance. Valve Performance Models There are a lot of attempts has been carried out throughout this mean. Some works 1 tried to bring a statistical modeling to predict the gas passage through the valve but some apparatus errors never let that go through. Correcting the facility error by another fellow 2 ended up to a correlation. This paper 2 proposed a criterion based on test rack opening pressure, Ptro, to differentiate between orifice and throttling flow. Eq. 1 and Eq. 2 bring the developed correlation for gas passage through orifice flow and throttling flow respectively.

AB  - Abstract Kuwait Oil Company (KOC) offshore exploration and development plans are underway to boost its production capacity to the future target rate. However, the selection of offshore field development scheme is critical due to the associated flow assurance risks, which impact project economics, safety, and sustainability. The objective of this study is to simulate and evaluate two offshore field development schemes, namely subsea multiphase flow, and platform schemes. The evaluation is based on the associated flow assurance risks, project economics, and environmental impact of each development schemes. The analysis covers simulation of each scheme, prediction of flow assurance risks, and prevention/mitigation of the risks during the entire life of the field. Results revealed that although the flow assurance risks in the subsea multiphase flow scheme are significant, it eliminates the large investment cost of platform, which improves the project economics significantly, and minimize environmental impact. Conversely, although the platform development scheme has low flow assurance risk, platform capital investment cost may impair the project economics, safety, and environmental impact. This study investigates each scheme by simulating, economically evaluating, and environmental impact assessing both schemes, to enable the right decision and selection of field development plan.

AB  - AbstractNew requirements have recently appeared for accurate and reliable flow rate measurements in various operational areas where viscous fluids are produced. Heavy oil as produced in Venezuela, Confederation of Independent States (CIS), Brazil, Angola and China and lighter oil emulsified with large water cuts (worldwide) present new challenges to multiphase metering. The compact, cost-effective multiphase meter described in this paper is intended to replace large, costly test separators designed for heavy oils. The meter is non-intrusive and combines a classical venturi to measure total mass flow rate and a dual energy gamma-ray composition meter to measure oil, water and gas fractions. A benefit of this compact design is that the meter can be switched from one well to another and provide robust, consistent flow rate measurements without any flow recalibration.According to published single-phase flow literature, liquid viscosity plays an important role in meter performance. Oil companies are becoming increasingly aware of these problems and want more evidence that a multiphase meter will perform regardless of fluid properties. To qualify the multiphase meter in high-viscosity flows, we conducted comprehensive flow loop tests in Venezuela. The challenge was to gain a solid understanding of viscosity effects even in the presence of large amounts of gas, and for the entire operating envelope of the meter. These test results have been used to refine the meter interpretation model to maintain the metering accuracy in these conditions. The interpretation includes a mixture viscosity model based on the dead-oil viscosity; for permanent monitoring and periodic testing, the effluent viscosity variations are updated when pressure, temperature or water cut is changing.To demonstrate that the specified measurement accuracy was achieved up to the highest viscosities tested (several thousand centipoise), the meter was field tested in comparison with a test separator. We present the results of 54 jobs.Until recently, the only multiphase meters available to measure viscous oil flowing with gas were intrusive. Positive displacement meters, such as oval gears, twin helical screws or vane types, were used to measure the total gas-liquid volume flow rate. These meters are very sensitive to severe slugging in the upstream pipeline and prone to mechanical damage from produced solid particles. The lightweight, small-footprint meter described here solves these problems. Consistent flow rate information can be obtained even when the meter is switched from well to well. Fluid property or flow regime changes do not affect the flow rate measurement.IntroductionOne of the main objectives of multiphase flow meter design is a low-cost system that will accurately measure the flow rates of oil, water and gas in difficult multiphase flow regimes. These include emulsions, high-viscosity oils and foaming conditions for which conventional metering systems based on phase separation have great difficulties or cannot successfully perform the tests. Even during efficient separation conditions in a conventional metering system, there is a significant advantage in continuously monitoring a well stream. Whereas a conventional testing system may take hours for stable measurements, a multiphase flow meter can yield good test results minutes after the well is opened.Elimination of a test separator, manifold and/or flow line is ordinarily the single most important reason for choosing to use a multiphase meter. Test separators and the associated metering equipment are expensive and require additional platform space on offshore topside installations. In satellite fields, a test line back to a test separator on a platform is a significant capital expense. For subsea applications the advantages are even greater as separate test lines and, in some cases, entire platforms, may be eliminated.

AB  - Abstract Flexible riser and pipeline systems have been proposed as a promising solution for offshore oil and gas production systems in various harsh and challenging marine environments. They have many advantages compared with traditional rigid riser and pipeline systems, including: relatively low axial bending stiffness; ability to spool on a reel for easy transport and faster installation; and suitability for various floating systems. Flexible riser and pipeline systems typically have buoyancy modules to produce a lazy wave or similar configuration in the riser to decouple the floating vessel motions from the touchdown point. However, the buoyancy modules may move or even drag the riser in the horizontal direction, which may cause the riser shape to change or the riser bottom to move on the seabed. The riser shape/configuration may change, even slightly, with the movement of buoyancy modules or flexible riser, resulting in potentially significant changes in flow assurance design issues related to slugging and system blowdown. Case studies were carried out using transient multiphase simulation software, as reported in this paper, to investigate the slugging issues impacted by slight variations in the riser configuration in flexible pipeline/riser systems, including slight uphill and downhill riser base configurations. These small changes in the riser shape/configuration can also cause significant differences in the resulting residual pressures in the subsea pipeline and riser after blowing down the system. The results from this paper suggest that the riser shape/configuration in flexible pipe systems has a significant impact on flow assurance concerns, especially the impact of slugging and blowdown residual pressures related to hydrate prevention and mitigation. Consequently, the sensitivity of riser shape/configuration in flexible riser and pipeline systems should be considered in early design phases to understand the impact on key flow assurance strategies.

AB  - ABSTRACTThe transport of hydrocarbon fluids in a multiphase manner has now become commonplace in both onshore and offshore pipeline transportation systems. Although respectively necessitated by different business drivers, the practice creates an additional dimension of complexity when it comes to the design and operation of such systems. The paper aims at presenting the current state of play in technology that is available to the pipeline engineer to design pipelines that will, at the onset or during later life, be operated under multiphase flowing conditions. It will attempt to provide a roadmap of what technology to use to address the various challenges of hydrodynamic as well as thermo-chemical flow assurance. In particular, phenomena will be addressed that include wax deposition, hydrate and asphaltene formation, terrain induced and severe slugging. Two-phase and three-phase transport will also be addressed.INTRODUCTION The analysis of multiphase flow phenomena is not a novelty by any means. Early analyses, [1], [2], [3], [4], and [5] focused on understanding the hydraulic behavior of the mixed fluids as they traveled in pipelines of various configurations, be they horizontal or inclined. The behavior, in terms of pressure drop and liquid hold-up (a measure of the amount of liquid in a particular pipeline cross-section on an instantaneous basis), was characterized in terms of appropriate equations that an engineer would employ providing data input that related to fluid properties, pipeline configuration, and flowrates for the respective fluid phases. The equations incorporated empirical terms that derived from specific experimental configurations and, therefore, lacked ubiquity. To this day, flow analysts must exercise caution when using such formulae to ensure appropriateness and applicability. The economics of offshore exploration in the early eighties drove the evolution of production systems incorporating satellite wells tied-back to a host platform - Figure 1. Such systems enabled production from off-set well locations using advanced sub-sea systems - Figures 2, and 3, without the necessity for additional, and substantial, infrastructure to process the fluids. The satellite production approach does, however, necessitate that the fluids be transported in a commingled multiphase manner and, as a result, delivered a new dimension in operational complexity as will be discussed in this paper. THE CHALLENGES The early nineties saw exploration and production traverse into deepwater (>1500ft WD) and, with the discovery of reserves in commercially viable quantities, the challenge evolved to determining the economic feasibility of developing the field(s) and transporting produced hydrocarbons to shore and on to refineries for processing. The cornerstone of such feasibility became what is now termed flow assurance defined as production operation that generates a reliable manageable and profitable flow of fluids from the reservoir to the sales point. Being able to assure the flow of production generally falls into two categories of challenge, namely: Hydrodynamic Chemical - Thermodynamic Hydrodynamic PhenomenaThe laying of pipelines and flowlines over undulating terrain results in pipeline configurations that incorporate inclined sections of pipe as well as dips. Both these elements result in flow pattern complexity when it comes to multiphase flow systems.

AB  - ABSTRACT: An experimental study on transient flows has been carried out by the Institut Français du Pétrole (IFP). Two and three phase flows have been studied in two complex geometries including 1 or 3 low points. Due to the complexity of the topography, the flow pattern was time and location dependent. To classify the data, the flow pattern has been characterised for the last low point on the loop. In this section, the water fraction has been measured. Several local pressure measurements have been realised over the total length of the loop. The experimental data have been used for the validation of the TACITE code against transient flow generated by complex geometry.1 INTRODUCTION A good understanding of the initiation and the development of the terrain slugging phenomenon is needed in production systems. Field experience shows that unexpected slug flow affects the production rate and the separator performances (flooding effects, poor separation…). In the particular case of mature oil fields (as in the North Sea), the water production increases rapidly. The uncertainties of the three-phase oil-gas-water fractions are particularly pronounced in the modelling of slug flow.

AB  - AbstractIn this paper we will present new results on stabilization of horizontal wells with gas lift. The stabilization is achieved by a novel dynamic feedback control solution using the production choke at the wellhead. The primary input to the dynamic feedback controller is a measurement of the downhole pressure.The field results to be presented are from the Brage field operated by Norsk Hydro in the North sea. Production at Brage began in 1993 and the field went off plateau in 1998. As the production has decreased, the problems related to unstable production from some of the wells have escalated steadily.The results from the extensive field tests on the Brage wells are very promising. The tests have confirmed the stabilization feature of the control solution. The pressure and flow variations have been dramatically reduced, and it is possible to produce the wells at a lower downhole pressure leading to increased production.IntroductionWith most oil and gas fields in the western world becoming mature, the industry is having to face a new reality: How to increase, or at least stabilize, production while maintaining available reserves at their present level. Indeed, unstable production in multiphase production systems pipelines can cause serious and troublesome operational problems for downstream receiving production facilities. Three approaches are conventionally practiced to manage the instabilities in wells: choking the flow, increasing the gas lift rate, or providing overcapacity to accommodate the gas and liquid slugs that are produced in an erratic manner. All these classical approaches imply inefficient production or expensive over-design. In most cases, too much gas is injected into the gas lifted wells or the production rate is not maximized. In more extreme cases the unstable well has to be shut in. In such situations even re-completion for decreasing the tubing size may be considered. However, this is an expensive alternative.Oil wells with long horizontal bores, and also gas lift wells, tend to behave erratically under certain operating conditions. Unstable production has many drawbacks. For example, surge hinders smooth operation and calls for safety measures and means of guarding against shutdown. Also, the total oil and gas production must be within the system's design capacity to provide adequate safety margins. Instability can sharply reduce lift gas efficiency, while difficulties with gas lift allocation computation are also common. Well instabilities also make it impossible to distribute the lift gas optimally. All in all, unstable wells are difficult to operate efficiently.At Brage a new approach for stabilization is now currently being tested. The new method is based on dynamic active feedback control of the production choke at the wellhead. Initial field tests were done in October 2000 and in March 2001 on the first candidate well; a horizontal gas lift well with a downhole pressure gauge. After these initial experiments, a two-months test was carried out from August 2001 to October 2001 on a similar well that had been shut in for three months due to severe slugging. In the present paper we will present the results from this extensive test.Brage Field DevelopmentGeneral OverviewThe Brage Field is located in the Norwegian sector of the North Sea and is operated by Norsk Hydro. Production commenced in September 1993 from five predrilled wells tied back to the steel jacket platform. The two main reservoirs, Fensfjord and Statfjord, are located at approximately 2100 and 2300 m TVD and consist of Jurassic age sandstones. One well has been drilled and completed in the Sognefjord reservoir, located in the north-eastern part of the field.

AB  - AbstractA large-scale multiphase flow experimental facility is used to study slug tracking behavior in pipelines. The description of the flow loop, testing procedure, analyses of data, and development of closure terms for a slug tracking model are the focus of this paper.Pressure, temperature, and liquid holdup were collected for 286 tests. Each test was characterized by a superficial liquid velocity, superficial gas velocity, length of pipeline, diameter of pipeline, and length and angle of the inclined sections of the pipeline in a hilly terrain configuration. Data collected in flow tests were analyzed to yield; (i) slug translational velocity, (ii) liquid holdup in slug and film, and (iii) slug length distribution. Correlations were derived for the slug translational velocity in the inclined sections. These correlations have been compared with an existing relation.It is the intent to use the correlations in a slug tracking model under development and validate the numerical simulator with the processed data. IntroductionThe slug structure is a common and complex flow pattern which occurs in a pipeline transporting a multiphase mixture. It consists of a region of liquid with entrained gases, referred to as the liquid slug body, a gas bubble or pocket, and a liquid film. Figure 1 shows a slug flow in a horizontal pipe. The case of slug flow in a vertical pipe is shown in Figure 2. An example of the flow situation in the case of a hilly terrain pipeline is illustrated in Figure 3.In the multiphase pipelines, slugs can be further differentiated according to the mode of formation. The slug flow structure may be initiated by flow instabilities, such as the Kelvin-Helmholtz instability. These are termed hydrodynamic slugs. In other cases, the geometry of the pipeline plays an important role in the slug formation. An example of this is a pipeline-riser pipe system. At low fluid flow rates, there is blockage at the base of the riser leading to an intermittent flow behavior termed severe slugging. Slugs formed as a result of the geometry are commonly referred to as terrain induced slugs.An initiated slug can grow or decay as it moves along a pipeline due to expansion, wake, and terrain induced effects. Slug tracking is the process whereby the development of the slug is traced from the initiation point to the point of decay or to the exit of the pipeline.An understanding and knowledge of the slug flow characteristics are necessary to permit, (i) a design of downstream process equipment such as slug catchers and separators,(ii) an analysis of the impact of the pressure and flow transients created by this complex flow on the reservoir,(iii) an analysis of the impact of the pressure and flow transients created by this complex flow on equipment and structures, and(iv) the effect of slugging on corrosion rates.The following sections describe an experimental study of slug flow in a hilly terrain pipeline. The main intention of the experiments is to obtain data on slug growth and slug dissipation in a hilly terrain configuration. The data obtained on tracking the slugs are to be used in the validation of a mathematical and numerical simulator currently under development. Details of the latter are to be presented in a paper at a later date.

AB  - Where well rates are outside the range of the test separator, operators usually have no choice but to estimate well production using back allocation techniques, which rarely capture the variance in flow rate over time. This was the case of a well in the Thistle field in the UK sector of the North Sea, where high-frequency flow rate was accurately calculated using ESP real-time data, which was instrumental in measuring inflow properties. The liquid flow-rate calculation was based on the principle that the power absorbed by the pump is equal to that generated by the motor, which provides a linear equation that can be resolved for rate. Water cut (WC) was calculated by measuring the production tubing differential pressure (DP), which provides the average fluid density, which is subsequently converted to a WC. Analytical equations are used throughout the process, ensuring that the physics are respected at all times. This yields greater repeatability and confidence than analogous methods, which are based on correlations and artificial intelligence. The calculations provided continuous liquid flow-rate and WC trends over the 6-month life of the ESP with a frequency of one calculation per minute with excellent repeatability and resolution. This enabled us to calculate inflow properties such as productivity index (PI) and skin, as well as history matching a reservoir simulation of the drainage area. This was essential to explaining why production dropped from 1500 to 500 B/D over a period of 8 months, which was found to be a lack of pressure support. The fall in production also caused production instability because of severe slugging, which could be remediated by concurrently increasing the tubing head pressure and ESP frequency without changing the drawdown. In addition to demonstrating the superiority of an analytical virtual flowmeter over correlations or artificial intelligence, the method also shows how the model can be calibrated accurately using an alternative pump reference curve, which is independent of flow rate, as opposed to traditional centrifugal pump curves. Flow-rate independence was indispensable because of the inability to physically measure rates with the existing test separator and was key to delivering accurate results.

AB  - Abstract Rigorous exact solutions in engineering are essentially non existent In all engineering problems one has to resort to some kind of approximations in which the physics of the problem is approximated and formulated in a format tractable by analytical or numerical means. This kind of approximation is termed MODELING. In the quest for more accurate, but yet, sufficiently simple approaches to the solution of two phase flow problems MODELING is of utmost importance. The term "Mechanistic Modeling" was adopted for modeling where the physical phenomenon Is approximated by taking into consideration the most important processes, neglect other less important effects that can complicate the problem but do not add considerably to the accuracy of the solution. "Mechanistic Modeling" should be sufficiently close to the natural phenomenon as the flow pattern involved should not be overlooked. Yet it will be sufficiently simple so that the solution is amenable with reasonable analytical or numerical efforts. Specific examples which relate to recent developments in Mechanistic Models for two phase flow such as the prediction of flow pattern, stratified flow and the stability of stratified flow, slug behavior in pipes, slug length distribution, severe slugging phenomenon and splitting in a tee junction will be presented. INTRODUCTION In the solution of engineering problems one can identify four major levels of approaches: 1. Exact or rigorous approach. 2. Approach via Modeling 3. Approach via Mechanistic modeling 4. Experimental correlations The division among these four options is not always clearly defined and it may be a relative definition depending on the specific terminology used in any specific area. The term rigorous or exact solution in fluid mechanics is used for the exact solution of the Navier-Stokes equation. P. 33^

AB  - Abstract For the determination of the design basis of the inlet separator in the offshore oil and gas plant, one of the most crucial factors is the liquid surge volume generated mainly by the transient phenomena such as riser slugging and pig-induced slugging. In particular, pig-induced slugging frequently brings about the most serious slug problems. In the study, a combination of a by-pass pig and an inlet- separator dual control valve scheme is introduced for the application, of which pigging operation is not possible by a conventional method because it causes inlet separator flooding. First, for the purpose of the estimation of the simulation accuracy, the stability map generated from an S-shaped riser experiment is compared with the prediction of OLGA simulation. And then, it is demonstrated that a combination of a by-pass pig and and inlet separator dual control scheme makes it possible to operate stable pigging, even though a conventional pigging is not available due to the excessive pig-induced slugging.

AB  - SummaryA multiphase flowmeter (MPFM) installed in offshore Egypt has accurately measured three-phase flow in extremely gassy flow conditions. The meter is completely nonintrusive, with no moving parts, requires no flow mixing before measurement, and has no bypass loop to remove gas before multiphase measurement. Flow regimes observed during the field test of this meter ranged from severe slugging to annular flow caused by the dynamics of gas-lift gas in the production stream. Average gas-volume fraction ranged from 93 to 98% during tests conducted on seven wells.The meter was installed in the Gulf of Suez on a well protector platform in the Gulf of Suez Petroleum Co. (Gupco) October field, and was placed in series with a test separator located on a nearby production platform. Wells were individually tested with flow conditions ranging from 1,300 to 4,700 B/D fluid, 2.4 to 3.9 MMscf/D of gas), and water cuts from 1 to 52%. The meter is capable of measuring water cuts up to 100%.Production was routed through both the MPFM and the test separator simultaneously as wells flowed with the assistance of gas-lift gas. The MPFM measured gas and liquid rates to within "10% of test-separator reference measurement flow rates, and accomplished this at gas-volume fractions from 93 to 96%. At higher gas-volume fractions up to 98%, accuracy deteriorated but the meter continued to provide repeatable results.IntroductionThe October field is located in the northern Gulf of Suez of Egypt and was discovered by Gupco in late 1979 with the drilling of the GS195-1 well (Fig. 1). The Nubia sandstone was found to contain a 27°API, undersaturated oil with an initial solution gas/oil ratio (GOR) of about 300 scf/bbl. By 1986, reservoir pressure had declined to the point that gas lift was installed to maintain production. The Nubia reservoir has a waterdrive recovery mechanism, and by 1986, water cuts had also begun to increase.Today, October production is characterized by three-phase flow. However because of the presence of gas-lift gas in the flowstream, gas-volume fractions at the surface are approximately 95% of pipeline volume, with the remaining 5% occupied by oil and water. In recent years, October drilling development has out-paced infrastructure development (flowlines and gas-lift compression). This has caused testlines to be used full-time for transporting production.The number and quality of well tests for a typical October well have declined because of the production-deferral effect of flowing one well through the testline while routing all other wells through the production line. In addition, the test separator at the production platform is used full-time for routine separation of production to minimize backpressure on all of the other platform risers. When a well is switched into the test separator, forcing the remaining field production to be separated in the three production separators, riser pressure at other platforms can increase by an average of 15 psi.Because of the pressure on the company to maximize production on a daily basis, wells at October field are only tested once every 3 to 6 months. A typical test lasts only 4 to 6 hours and rarely involves producing only one well through the testline. Again, because of the issue of deferred production, two or more wells (including the well to be tested) are initially placed in the testline to the test separator and their collective rate is established. The following day, the well of interest is shut in and the remaining wells are tested. The decrease in total tested rate is assumed to be from the well that was shut in. This method of testing obviously has several disadvantages and potential errors in assumptions.Multiphase metering in the October field provides a means of acquiring the frequency and quality of well tests that are needed to manage the Nubia reservoir without deferring production. Other advantages include minimal maintenance, savings on test pipelines, rapid identification of well problems, and improved gas-lift-gas allocation.Meter DescriptionThe MPFM chosen for installation at the October field was the Fluenta 1900VI. The meter was designed to measure oil, water, and gas phases of a multiphase flow without separation of the well stream. The instruments are completely nonintrusive, with no moving parts, requiring no gas bypass line, having no mixing device, and providing real-time output in standard conditions. The meter measures the phase fractions and velocities, and then determines the flow rates of oil, water, and gas.The MPFM consists of the following sensors: a capacitance sensor unit, an inductive sensor unit, a gamma-densitometer, a venturi meter, and pressure and temperature transmitters. The sensors are mounted on a portable skid, as shown in Fig. 2. An explosion-proof (Ex-d) capsule mounted on the skid contains all the necessary electronics and computer cards to receive and process the signals from the different sensors. These electronics and computer cards are called the system computer.The processor card inside the Ex-d capsule is equipped with two communication ports. One of the ports is dedicated to the remote terminal unit (RTU) for transmitting all measurements (such as flow rates, pressure, and temperature) by radio to the October production-complex computer. The other port is used to connect a laptop computer to the meter for servicing and onsite monitoring of readings. The recorded data will be stored in the system computer even if no laptop computer or RTU is connected.The meter skid weighs approximately 3,300 lbm, and was lifted onto the October H platform using a workboat crane. Space requirements for the meter are minimal, as the meter is about 6 ft wide by 4 ft deep by 8 ft high. The meter is powered by automotive batteries, which are recharged by four solar panels.Measurement PrincipleThe MPFM measures the fractions and velocities of the different phases using a capacitance sensor, an inductive sensor, a gamma-densitometer, a venturi meter, and pressure and temperature transmitters.

AB  - Conventional IPR models are used in coupled wellbore-reservoir transient simulations, even if bottomhole pressure conditions are assumed to be constant on the derivation of such IPR models. The dynamic IPR model proposed in this paper not only captures the relevant reservoir dynamics from the well perspective, but is also computationally more efficient than discretized models using hundreds of gridblocks to simulate the near wellbore region. Any well-behaved function can be decomposed in a combination of sinusoidal functions. Hence, a sinusoidal bottomhole flowing pressure with a frequency varying from a given value down to zero is assumed as a boundary condition to the hydraulic diffusivity equation. The zero frequency corresponds exactly to the conventional IPR model since it is the steady-state condition. The analytical solution that calculates the flow rate for the sinusoidal pressures for each one of the frequencies is presented. Finally, the Dynamic IPR is defined as the low-order, linear ordinary differential equation that best approximates this solution. It is a well known fact that the reservoir dynamics is relevant to the calculation of the flow rate in certain conditions, such as drawdown and pressure buildup well tests. A comparison between the Dynamic IPR function, the conventional IPR models, and the analytical solution is presented for these cases. The conventional IPR model gives unrealistic results, since it allows the flow rate to change instantaneously to the next equilibrium condition, as opposed to the Dynamic IPR which can capture the fully transient response. The Dynamic IPR showed excellent agreement with the true solution. Two different examples are presented in this paper showing the application of the Dynamic IPR: a reservoir well testing and a severe slugging well. With a given measured bottomhole flowing pressure, a comparison between the Dynamic IPR, conventional IPR and a reservoir simulation is presented. Once again, the conventional IPR model provides unsatisfactory results when compared to the Dynamic IPR. These results showed that neglecting reservoir dynamics in transient simulations might result in inadequate production forecasts, inefficient designs and eventually unsafe operations while using conventional IPR models. This work points out some limitations in one of the common practices in the industry, which is the use of steady state IPR for coupled wellbore-reservoir transient simulations. The alternative Dynamic IPR herein proposed is computationally inexpensive when compared to discretized reservoir models while still being able to capture the transient well behavior and the steady-state solution.

AB  - Introduction Flow assurance is an engineering analysis process to assure hydrocarbon fluids are transmitted economically from the reservoir to the end user over the life of a project in any environment. The term "Flow Assurance" was first used by Petrobras in the early 1990s, it originally only covered the thermal hydraulics and production chemistry issues encountered during oil and gas production. While the term is relatively new, the problems related with flow assurance have been a critical issue in the oil/gas industry from very early days. Hydrates were observed causing blockages in gas pipelines as early as the 1930s. Another problem is slugging and liquid handling. The occurrence of slug flow in a transportation pipeline and a gathering system can cause many problems in design and operation processes, which include kinetic force on fittings and vessels, pressure cycling, control instability and inadequate phase separation. Slugging affects greatly the design of receiving facilities. In gas condensate systems, larger lines result in more liquid being retained in the pipeline at low rates. When the flow rate is increased, much of the liquid can be swept out, potentially overwhelming the liquid handling capability of the receiving facilities. The facilities can be flooded and damaged if the slugs larger than the slug catcher capacity. Therefore, quantifying the slug size, frequency and velocity is necessary prior to equipment design.

AB  - Abstract Ageing offshore oilfields with increasing water cuts can suffer from severe slugging and liquid hold-up in subsea flowlines. Excessive liquid loading in flowline and riser sections results in unstable processing condition on the topside; potentially leading to off-spec crude oil and produced water and in extreme cases to production deferment due to level alarm and trips in production separators. Recently, a novel black oil foamer (BOF) application in the GOM was able to mitigate slugging in a deepwater subsea tieback. The oil based foamer is designed to transition the flow regime from slugging to dispersed flow, allowing gas to sweep liquid to the surface. This paper will describe how steady state multiphase modeling was used to verify if foamer application can result in a reduction of liquid hold up and, hence, production improvement. Additionally, the modeling results will be compared to the recent field trial. Multiphase flow modeling has been performed for fluids of 23-37 API with a GOR of 400-4,000 scf/bbl with a flowline water cut between 16% and 50%. The fluid data were incorporated in the model with the pipeline geometry and topography, or suitable approximations when data was unavailable. The simulation results provided insight into the flow regime for various production scenarios, and thus, suitability of the oil based foamer technology. The simulation results showed that the riser switches between slug flow and bubble flow regimes. The mechanism of oil based foamer technology for slugging elimination is a transition from slug flow to annular dispersed flow. Fluid flow models shows good match with slugging seen in field without foamer. Additionally, fluid property was adjusted to incorporate foamer effect on lowered liquid density. This case mimics application of oil based foamer and results in no slugging regime for GOM case, hence improved production rate. This novel use of multiphase modeling for foamer applications will allow to more accurately identify opportunities for oil based foamer applications, and eventually be able to predict the effect of foamer on system slugging and production enhancement.

AB  - Abstract In a major oilfield in Saudi Arabia, detailed Information on individual well performance is required for operating and planning purposes. Complete design data can only be obtained planning purposes. Complete design data can only be obtained through the addition of extensive facilities for periodic testing of all production in the field. Three different test pipeline configurations were considered. Variables included pipe diameter, pipeline length, oil production rate, gas/liquid ratio, and water cut. Lengths up to approximately 10 miles (16.1 km) were considered. Three types of analyses were undertaken. The first analysis included steady state pressure losses In not only the horizontal segments but also the vertical risers and downcomers at the platforms. The second set of calculations involved transient simulations for both increasing and decreasing flow rates. Finally, slug length and period predictions for both normal and "severe" slugging were predictions for both normal and "severe" slugging were performed. Severe slugging occurs only at very low no"' rates performed. Severe slugging occurs only at very low no"' rates and negative pipeline inclination angles. Pressure drop calculations based on the Beggs and Brill correlation, with a rough pipe friction factor, showed that 10 in. (25.4 cm) pipelines were adequate for most cases. Transient simulation results indicated that, in general, less than two hours were required to reestablish steady state flow for both increasing and decreasing rates. Normally occurring slugs were found to vary in average length from about 200 to 600 ft (61 to 183m) with a maximum possible slug length of approximately 2500 ft (762 m). Liquid slug lengths for severe slugging varied from about 100 to 800 ft (30. 5 to 244 depending on the pipeline length and riser height. Introduction In a major offshore oilfield in Saudi Arabia, detailed information on individual well performance is required for operating and planning purposes. The desired information can only be obtained through the addition of extensive facilities for periodic testing of all wells in the field. Three different possible test pipeline configurations were considered and are designated as alternatives A, B, and C. The various alternatives would have test stations located either on production platforms or on separator platforms (GOSPs). Some test stations could be located platforms (GOSPs). Some test stations could be located onshore with others located offshore. Each of the alternatives also has a variation in pipe diameter, pipeline length, production rates, GLRs and water cuts. Table 1 indicates the variables and the number of each variable to be considered for calculations. Because of the large number of data to be considered, it was necessary to develop the coding system described in Table 2. Nominal pipeline diameters of 8, 10 and 12 in. (20.32, 25. 40 and 30. 48 cm) were used for all calculations. Schedule 40 pipe was assumed with internal diameters of 7.981, 10.020 and 11.938 in. (20.27, 25.45 and 30.32 cm), respectively. Average lengths vary from 13,000 to 29,000 ft (3962.4 to 8839.2 m) with maximum pipeline lengths of 22,000 to 50,000 ft (6705.6 to 15240.0 m). Production rates to be considered were 2,000 and 25,000 STBL/D (318. 0 and 3974. 7 m3/d) and an average production rate of 8,000 STBL/D (1271.9 m3/d). Three types of two-phase flow calculations were performed for each alternative. The first calculations were performed for each alternative. The first calculations were steady state pressure losses for the various lengths, diameters, flow rates, gas-liquid ratios, and water cuts. The second calculations performed were transient simulations of flow behavior when inlet flow rate changes occurred. These simulations were necessary for predicting the length of time required to reestablish the steady state flow conditions required to obtain meaningful well test data. The final type of calculations performed were to estimate anticipated liquid slug length and other slug characteristics. For all three types of calculations, at least two methods were used to confirm results. Following sections describe these calculations and general results. Appendix A contains figures that Illustrate the four pipeline configurations considered for alternatives A, B and C. P. 607

AB  - Abstract As multiphase production moves to environments of greater water depth and lower temperatures, there poses a huge setback in the assurance of continuous flow from the reservoir through the pipelines to the topside. Slug flow which is a common occurrence encountered in the oil industry is characterized by an alternating flow of liquid and gas resulting in an unsteady behavior of the fluid. In this paper a hypothetical case model exhibiting slugging characteristics is being developed using OLGA. The paper investigates the effect of current slug mitigation techniques such as topside choking, implementation of gas injection and a combination of the two used in the industry. The aim of this paper is to discuss on the results produced from each technique and decide on the most effective approach. From the generated results and research, it was observed a combination of both gas injection and topside choking simultaneously provides the most effective approach in eliminating slugging and increase production.

AB  - Abstract Objectives/Scope One of the main objectives of the wells, reservoir and facilities management (WRFM) is to reduce production decline caused by falling reservoir pressure and water breakthrough. Traditional WRFM efforts focus on well interventions; however, facilities optimization can also help to maintain production levels, as has been demonstrated in Shell's Sarawak gas asset in Malaysia, where various measures have led to a total of over 50 Bscf of additional gas production over a period of several years for investments less than $1 million per year. Methods, Procedures, Process The Sarawak asset is a complex production network of 14 producing gas fields with 3 manned offshore gas-processing hubs, 7 unmanned platforms and 3 subsea installations. The gas network is producing below its plateau production level. The below capacity production leads to slugging in pipeline-riser systems and wells and creates large liquid hold-ups in pipelines. Water production from wells is increasing. To maximize current production and extend production further into the future, a structured exercise to optimize the upstream facilities was started. Unnecessary pressure drops were eliminated, pigging procedures optimized, and slug and water control methodologies implemented. Results, Observations, Conclusions Any location where a pressure drop occurs in the process is a potential opportunity for optimization. Opportunities were found in inlet separators, at the compressor suction sides, water handling capacity and platform export locations. A novel implementation led to a floating pipeline export pressure matching the pipeline operating pressure to maximize production. Pigging with large liquid hold ups often incur production deferment by cutting production before pig launch or closing the slugcatcher inlet when the liquid comes in. Bypass pigging has been deployed in 7 production lines to fully eliminate deferment. Shell Sarawak Berhad (SSB) has been making effective use of Shell's proprietary Smart Choke slug control technology to allow pipeline-riser systems to operate far below their minimum turndown rate. It has now become the first company to adopt the technology directly on a well head to lower the impact of slugging from a well. Dynamic models of multiphase flow pipelines have been built to extend the production cut-off date by lowering the minimum operational flow rate through a combination of operational changes and novel technologies validated by field tests. Novel/Additive Information This paper demonstrates the production gains which can be achieved by doing a relatively small investment. The focus lies on facility optimization (part of WRFM) through a process of continuous improvement of proven technologies. A good example is increasing the operating envelope for Shell's Smart Choke slug control system from pipeline-riser systems to wells applications.

AB  - ABSTRACTSlug flow is a flow pattern commonly encountered in offshore Multiphase flow lines. It is characterized by an alternate flow of liquid slugs and gas pockets, resulting in an unsteady hydrodynamic behavior. All important design variables, such s slug length and slug frequency, liquid holdup, and pressure drop, vary with time and this makes the prediction of slug flow characteristics both difficult and challenging. This paper reviews the state of the art methods in slug catcher sizing and slug volume predictions. In addition, history matching of measured slug flow data is performed using the OLGA transient simulator. This paper reviews the design factors that impact slug catcher sizing during steady state, during transient, during pigging, and during operations under a process control system. . The slug tracking option of the OLGA simulator is applied to predict the slug length and the slug volume during a field operation. This paper will also comment on the performance of common empirical slug prediction correlations. INTRODUCTIONThere is an increasing need to develop more oil and gas design and development of economical offshore production fields in harsh offshore environments. The special problems associated with offshore operations pose new challenges in the systems.In an offshore environment the transient effects during start-up and shut-down of the production system become more pronounced. New transient simulation tools such as OLGA andPLAC are being used more in the design and modeling of these transient effectsSlug flow is one of the most common flow patterns. It is characterized by an unsteady, alternating flow of liquid slugs and gas pockets. Due to its highly complex nature, the prediction of slug length, slug frequency and pressure drop by thematically means is almost impossible. Due to its impedance to oil and gas production operations, many studies have been camied out and empirical and mechanistic models have been developed. "Steady state" slug flow can be classified as either hydrodynamic or terming induced slugging. "Transient" slugging can also occur in pipelines as a result of changing operating conditions, pigging or duringstart-up opemtions. Empirical correlations based on field or labotary data have been developed to predict the transition to slug flow, the slug velocity, the slug length, the slug frequency, and the statistical distribution of slug lengths. Hydrodynamic slugging is the normal slugging pattern enounced in flowlines. Most of the empirical methods developed for predicting the tradition to slug flow were developed for horizontal or near horizontal pipes. The most often used slug length prediction methods in the industry for large pipe diameter are the rilll correlation and its revisions, such as the Norris2 correlation, and the Scott et. al.3 Correlation. Terrain induced slugging is induced by low points in the flowline which may shrink, or grow after the dip. It is more dynamic and less understood compared with hydrodynamic slugging. Every flowline through hilly termin has its own elevation profile, therefore has its own slugging characteristics. The worst kind of terrain induced slugging is severe slugging .

AB  - Abstract The Chinguetti field located west of the Mauritania coastline has recently experienced a slugging condition in its flowline and riser systems. A study was undertaken in which integrated production system models of Chinguetti wells, flowlines and risers were developed using OLGA® transient multiphase flow simulator. The field is at a water depth of ~800m and was developed with subsea wells, manifolds, 2 flexible flowlines and lazy "S?? shaped risers tied back to a permanently moored turret Floating Production Storage Offloading (FPSO) located 6km away from the furthest drill centre. The main objective of the study was to assess slugging and potential methods to improve flow stability in the Chinguetti systems. An extensive field validation and benchmarking exercise was performed by tuning the models to match field pressures and phase flowrates in the systems. The goal was to validate the models as closely imitating the conditions in the field. However, uncertainties in the field data made it difficult to reach satisfactory results in the benchmarking exercise. Simulations were then performed to examine the impact of various changes in operating conditions on flow instability. These included changes in well routings, gas lift injection rates and location of injection points, riser and wellhead choke openings. The degree of fluctuations in liquid arrival rates and the characteristics of liquid slugs (length and frequency) were used to categorize the severity of flow instabilities for a range of operating conditions. Results from field implementation of recommended changes in operating conditions indicated improvement in flow stability. The success of this study was found to be dependent not only upon the inputs and assumptions made in the production system models but also on the outcome of the field validation exercises, and the understanding of pertinent governing factors influencing slugging behavior. The study highlights the methodology and analysis used to assess flow instability, outcome of field implementation, challenges faced and solutions proposed to minimize the flow instability of a deepwater oil field development. Introduction The Chinguetti deepwater oil field of the Mauritania coastline has been producing oil since February 2006 and has recently experienced a flow instability condition in its deepwater flowlines and risers. Flow instability or commonly referred to as slugging is defined by an unsteady, alternating flow of liquid slugs and gas pockets or by periodical change of pressure and gas-liquid flows. A study was conducted to assess the slugging phenomena and the potential methods to improve flow stability in the Chinguetti deepwater systems. The field is at a water depth of 800m was discovered in 2001 and the production was started in February 2006. A schematic of the Chinguetti field development is illustrated in Figure 1. The crude oil has a specific gravity in the order of 25-30 deg API. Excess gas is injected at Banda gas field which is approximately 17km away from Chinguetti. The field was developed with subsea wells, manifolds, flexible flowlines and risers tied back to a permanently moored FPSO with a maximum storage capacity of 1.67 million barrels of oil. The production is sent through a dual 10-inch piggable flowline and riser. The production from the wells is distributed via three production manifolds (drill centres DC1, DC2 and DC3). The looped production flowline allows the system to be dead-oil-displaced during shutdown. The field is equipped with gas lift and water injection systems arranged in a daisy-chain configuration to improve oil production and ultimate recovery from the reservoir.

AB  - Summary This paper proposes an extension to an existing operating-envelope technique used for underbalanced drilling (UBD) to enhance control of bottomhole pressure and inflow parameters. With the use of an implementation of the drift-flux model (DFM) with boundary conditions typically encountered in underbalanced operations (UBO), a steady-state analysis of the system is performed. Through this analysis, four distinct operating regimes are identified, and the behavior in each of them is investigated through steady-state calculations and transient simulations. In particular, the analysis reveals that a section of the operating envelope previously believed to be unstable/transient is, in fact, stable/steady when a fixed choke opening is used as an independent variable in place of a fixed wellhead pressure (WHP). This results in the steady-state operating envelope being extended, and gives an increased understanding of the well behavior encountered in UBO toward enabling the introduction of automated control. Finally, we investigate the mechanism behind severe slugging in UBO and argue that the cause is different from that of the slugging encountered in production and multiphase transport.

AB  - AbstractThe Albacora Leste Field development plan comprises thirty horizontal wells (16 production wells and 14 injection wells) tied back to a host FPSO platform, P-50, moored at a 1,230 m water depth, through an innovative spread mooring system. Three out of the injection wells are in a piggy-back configuration. After processing, treatment and storage, the oil production is transferred to onshore terminals using shuttle tankers.The selected artificial lift method is the continuous subsea gas lift, comprising a very simple and reliable well completion. In terms of flow assurance, design strategies and operational procedures developed for the Campos Basin are employed, to prevent wax deposition, hydrate formation and severe slugging for normal operation and during shutdown and startup.All risers are flexible and installed in a free hanging configuration due to the field water depth, the FPSO anchoring type and the pipe internal diameters ranging from 4in to 9.13in. Environmental conditions and FPSO motions were also relevant factors for flexible risers design definitions. All flexible lines were anchored by means of torpedo piles (free fall).This paper will describe the relevant aspects of Albacora Leste field development regarding the subsea system, artificial lift design and flow assurance issues, comprising the planning, design, qualification, manufacturing, and installation activities.IntroductionThe Albacora Leste field is located in the deep north area of the Campos Basin, offshore Brazil, approximately, 120 km off the coast, see figure 1. Water depths in this field range from 800 m to 2,000 m, and the oil densities range from 17 to 21 API degrees.The field development comprises 30 horizontal wells (16 production wells and 14 injection wells , three of which in a piggy-back configuration), tied back to a host FPSO (Floating Production Storage and Offloading Vessel) platform, P-50, by means of flexible risers and flowlines.Bending stiffeners and top risers accessories development and qualification represented an important and challenging success factor for the project. A new concept was developed and qualified for bending stiffeners hanging systems at bellmouth for the umbilical of the piggy-back wells. Three test benches were designed and assembled, in order to perform the long term fatigue tests for the gas export flexible riser and to validate the new concept of the stiffeners hanging systems. A fourth test bench was upgraded to re-qualify production and injection umbilicals submitted to higher laying loads.The FPSO will be moored at a 1,230 m water depth, using the innovative Differential Compliance Anchoring System (DICAS).The P-50 topside processing plant was designed to handle 180,000 bpd of liquid, 6,000,000 std m3/d of gas and 40,000 m3/d for water injection. The oil, after treatment and storage in the FPSO tank, is pumped to a DP shuttle tanker in a tandem configuration.

AB  - Abstract The use of multiphase transient flow models in pipes by PETROBRAS has increased since the early 90's. Most of its motivation came from the need for more accurate analysis of transient operations that naturally take place in offshore activities, such as gas-lift well startup and boosting techniques under intermittent flow. During the first years, the dynamic multiphase flow models were mainly used for providing qualitative analysis and had relatively little influence on project decisions. In the forthcoming years, the development of new deepwater fields in low temperature environment has brought the need for more sophisticated pressure and temperature predictions. In this scenario, the use of the complex and comprehensive transient multiphase models has become mandatory to mitigate risks in the development projects. Situations such as severe slugging, wax deposition, hydrate formation, shut-downs and start-ups are examples of transient multiphase flow conditions that must be fully evaluated and understood for a sound engineering design and safe operation. One of the key issues in using the available transient codes, either commercial software or in-house models, is the confidence in the results they generate. In order to validate the models, one needs to rely on the comparison of the theoretical predictions against experimental data, from both, laboratory and field. PETROBRAS has been making efforts in building a data base to allow field validation of the used models, despite the difficulties in obtaining reliable and good quality field data. This work aims at describing the experience accumulated in applying a commercial model to design and trouble shoot operations under steady and transient multiphase flow conditions in the Campos Basin. The model strengths and weaknesses, as currently seen by their users at PETROBRAS, based on the limited available field data, will be shown.IntroductionSubsea wells, manifolds and floating production units have been widely used in the Brazilian offshore production systems since the 1970's. Presently, the offshore fields share represents nearly 90% of the total oil production. Especially during the last years, oil and gas production from deep and ultra deep waters has increased considerably, mainly in the Campos and Espirito Santo basins. In this typically low temperature scenario, the acquisition and prediction of values for pressure, temperature, flowrates, holdup etc., are essential to the reservoir management and safety of the operations. Thus, in the absence of reliable information, even the most ordinary operational problems become difficult to interpret and wrong decisions may be implemented. That may be particularly true in situations involving startup and shutdown operations, in addition to some others that may lead to pipe blockage.Transient multiphase flow models - and their computational implementation - are important tools to predict operational problems, other than conceiving and testing mitigating procedures. They are available as commercial tools or as companies' in-house codes developed for specific applications. In order to evaluate the closeness between models and field data, three history cases were analyzed. The field data are compared the numerical predictions for ordinary operations involving shutdown, startup and pigging.

AB  - Abstract An integrated transient wellbore/reservoir model is described and applied to investigate the liquid loading in a gas well. The well produces from a storage reservoir with water coning from its aquifer.  The integrated model shows that the water cone causes the gas flow rate from each gas layer to decrease and the liquid holdup in the wellbore to increase. Depending on reservoir conditions, the well may enter into a mode of unsteady production during which the gas flow rate cycles over a period of several days. The reason for this unsteady flow is uncovered by the simulation. Simulation results are compared with operational experience and full field reservoir simulations. The integrated model provides more realistic results compared to methods where the reservoir and the wellbore are modeled separately.  Introduction Oil and gas production from the mature fields often encounters challenges as the reservoir depletes. Liquid loading in gas wells is one of them. Several techniques have been developed throughout the years to address the issue of gas well loading[1]. Though some of the techniques are well established, there is a growing demand for better simulation tools to optimize the operations.  For example, dynamic wellbore/reservoir integrated simulation is required when studying the transient liquid loading processes in gas wells. On the one hand, a reservoir model is needed to simulate the changes in well productivity and phase mobility as fluid saturations gradually change in the near wellbore area. On the other hand, a transient wellbore multiphase flow model is required to predict the onset of loading and the flow transients resulting from liquid accumulation. Furthermore the mechanisms of the many liquid loading mitigation techniques (plunger-lift, compression, pumping, and gas-lift) are dynamic processes where the variables are constantly changing and interacting with each other. In that context, it is becoming evident that the complete system from the reservoir to the receiving facility must be considered as a whole rather than each component being studied separately.    There are also some other dynamic situations where interactions between reservoir and wellbore are important: Severe slugging in pipelines and wells can cause fluctuations in bottom-hole pressure that affect the flow from the reservoir. Depending on the characteristics of the near-wellbore region the variations in the inflow can feed forward and aggravate the unstable behavior of the system. At low flow rates there can be slow liquid build-up in the wellbore resulting in either the liquid being lifted out in a steady or unsteady flow pattern or the well dying. During well shut-in, the pressure will build up more slowly in the near-wellbore reservoir than in the wellbore resulting in a delayed shut-in pressure peak and holdup buildup. At start-up, the well may produce a large slug or not be able to start flowing. Under case of density-wave instability or casing heading in gas-lifted wells, the near-wellbore region will interact with the flow in the tubing and may contribute to dampen or amplify the oscillations. Gas and water coning in the near wellbore region cause the inflow to change with time, which affect the operation of the downstream equipment. In all the above cases, a coupled model of the wellbore and near-wellbore reservoir is required to accurately simulate the dynamics, analyse the phenomena, and numerically test the remedial actions or control schemes. Some cases above are addressed in a separate publication[2] using the same integrated model introduced in this paper.

AB  - Abstract In [1] and [2], an automated surveillance and optimization system has been developed and deployed to multiple offshore gas lifted assets. In this paper, we will present key enhancements to the system that improve the detection and management of unstable flows in offshore gas lifted wells. The enhanced system provides engineers and operators with a comprehensive solution for well flow surveillance and optimization. Examples will be presented to show the successful implementation of quantitative slug scanning, gas lift multi-pointing diagnostics, and production surveillance for unstable flows. The slug scanning module supplements the pattern recognition and machine learning features in GLOWTM [1]. It scans the historical high-frequency pressure data, quantifies the amplitude and frequency of the cyclic oscillations, and then aggregates the data into bins of varying severity levels and a simple slugging index that can be used by operations for effective communication. To better understand gas lift multi-pointing that damages gas lift valves and harms production, transient flow models were developed with accurate modeling of gas lift valves, and then calibrated to historical well tests. Models accurately replicated the amplitude and frequency of pressures that may appear like hydrodynamic slugging, and revealed the open-and-close behaviors among multiple gas lift valves. Finally, the calibrated models were used to generate operational maps with different flow regimes, and such maps aid either asset staff or the GLOW™ system to optimize asset production while managing various types of unstable flows. The developed system combines data-driven and physics-based approaches for online advisories, and utilizes a novel history matching procedure to enhance the model's predictive capability for complex well behaviors. In summary, the system provides a comprehensive, robust, and integrated set of tools that meets the surveillance and optimization needs of asset staff.

AB  - AbstractA simulator has been developed to track two-phase slugs in pipelines transporting liquid and gas mixtures. The algorithm consists of close coupling of a one dimensional hydrodynamic slug flow model with an interface tracking methodology, and solving both simultaneously with an iterative procedure. The tracking scheme is based on propagating the fronts and backs of the liquid slugs to new locations during an incremental time step. New positions of the interfaces determine if a slug will enter the pipeline, exit the pipeline, collapse, merge with a slug ahead of it, or none of the above. The solution procedure determines the locations and the characteristics of all the slug units which exist in the pipeline at a given time.Data collected in hilly-terrain and horizontal pipes in a large-scale multiphase flow loop were used to validate the slug tracking simulator. The average absolute percent errors in predicting the maximum slug length and inlet pressure were 12.6 and 0.47 respectively. A case study with field data collected on a 14,762 feet, 16 in. pipeline showed that the simulator predicted the maximum slug length and inlet pressure with absolute percent errors of 11.6 and 4.3 respectively. The comparisons are good and provide confidence in using the algorithm and the simulator to model and track two-phase slugs in hilly-terrain pipelines.The simulator can be used to determine the characteristics of the slug unit used to design separators and slug catchers. It can also be used to analyze the impact of the flow and pressure transients on reservoirs, equipment, and structures, and study the effects of slugging on corrosion rates. The history of each slug in the pipe can be traced by determining if it will grow, shrink, collapse, or remain the same size as it traverses the pipe. During slug tracking, slug lengths are determined by the locations of interfaces instead of a correlation.IntroductionThe efficient and economic production of hydrocarbon reserves found in reservoirs located in marginal fields and hostile environments often require the transportation of unprocessed fluids. In the case where the fluids are hydrocarbon gas, hydrocarbon liquid, and formation water, a multiphase flow mixture is the result. A common occurrence in a pipeline transporting a multiphase flow mixture is the existence of flow patterns. These flow structures are characterized by a distribution of the interfaces separating the phases. Examples of flow patterns include churn, bubble, slug, and annular in vertical pipes; stratified, dispersed bubble, slug, and annular in horizontal multiphase flow. These flow structures are determined by, (i) operational variables, such as flow rates of fluids and pressure; (ii) geometrical variables, such as diameter and angle of inclination of pipe; and, (iii) physical properties of the fluids being transported, such as density and viscosity.Flow variables in multiphase transportation are dependent on the distribution of the phases. These variables include liquid holdup, gas void fraction, pressure gradient, and heat and mass transfer coefficients. Thus, it is necessary to know not only when these flow patterns occur, but also the characteristics associated with each flow structure.The slug structure is a common and complex two phase flow pattern. It consists of a region of liquid with entrained gases, referred to as the liquid slug body; a gas bubble or pocket, and a liquid film. Figure 1 shows the slug flow pattern in the case of horizontal flow.In multiphase pipelines, slugs can be differentiated according to its mode of formation. The slug flow structure may be initiated by flow instabilities, such as the Kelvin-Helmholtz instability. These are termed hydrodynamic slugs. In other cases, the geometry of the pipeline plays an important role in slug formation. An example of this is a pipeline-riser pipe system. At low fluid flow rates, there is blockage at the base of the riser leading to an intermittent flow behavior termed severe slugging. Slugs formed as a result of the geometry are commonly referred to as terrain induced slugs.

AB  - Abstract An offshore flow system is designed to operate at steady state. However, it is possible that this condition does not exist. The stability of an offshore flow system depends on the set of parameters that defines the operational state and can be numerically determined. The stationary solution is given as initial condition for the numerical simulation; if the numerical solution does not go away from the initial condition with time, the stationary solution is stable and it is the system steady state. If the numerical solution goes away with time, the stationary state is unstable, there is no steady state and an oscillatory solution develops. As a numerically cost efficient alternative to time simulations, the linear stability theory is a powerful technique to identify the stable and unstable regions. This paper presents the main features of a stability solver developed for oil production systems. Numerical results are presented for two oil fields. Stability maps are obtained and compare to field data. The comparison showed an excellent agreement with the operational conditions presented.

AB  - Abstract Due to its limited drainage radius, the sand face pressure in a hydraulically fractured, horizontal shale oil well will fall rapidly with cumulative production. Once the sand face pressure falls below the bubble point, flow instabilities will increase dramatically. The onset of instability can be predicted using a transient multiphase simulator such as OLGA1, and techniques to minimize instabilities can be quantitatively investigated through simulation. This paper describes flow instabilities in a typical horizontal shale oil well and demonstrates both causes and remedies for fluctuating production rates in the intermediate and latter stages of well life. Through the suppression of production instability, the ultimate recovery of reserves may be significantly increased. Introduction Through the use of horizontal drilling and hydraulic fracturing techniques, oil and gas reserves in previously un-economic, low permeability, shales can be recovered. Upon initial production, the reservoir pressure is frequently sufficiently high that the sand face pressure is above the reservoir fluid bubble point. The resulting single phase liquid flow in the wellbore can be produced at stable rates, simplifying the design and operation of surface facilities. Due to the limited drainage radius, however, the reservoir pressure will fall rapidly with cumulative production. As a result, sand face pressures may fall below the reservoir fluid bubble point within months of the start of production. When this occurs, a vapor liquid flow will occur in the horizontal section of the wellbore, possibly resulting in wildly unstable variations in fluid production rate. Even with hydraulic fracturing, the effective productivity index (PI) is low by conventional well standards, resulting in low reservoir fluid influx rates per foot of horizontal section. At the same time, the mechanical requirements of horizontal well drilling and hydraulic fracturing techniques require horizontal section liners of at least 4 in to 6 in. As a result, fluid velocities in the horizontal section are generally quite low, resulting in a stratified vapor-liquid flow in the horizontal section. This stratified flow produces a large, fairly stagnant, gas volume that can drive strong terrain slugging in the vertical section of the well through periodic gas accumulation and blow out. This vigorous, terrain-induced, slugging is an inherently transient process that depends on the details of wellbore geometry, reservoir fluid properties, reservoir pressure, completion and perforation details, production rate, and multiphase fluid dynamics. As a result, wellbore instability can be predicted only through a transient multiphase flow simulation. In addition, such a simulation suggests techniques for the suppression of the potentially severe fluctuations of well production rates.

AB  - The application of advanced control techniques in offshore oil production plants is a challenge. There are many changes in operational points in time, for example, the process is affected by the natural oil well's behavior dynamics. Besides that, limited instrumentation available has to be considered when thinking in oil optimization and control. In order to improve the scenario, taylor-made advanced control modules have been developed for those units. The present article will present development, implementation and results of anti-slug control for four platforms located at Campos and Santos basins. Severe slugging flow regimes are one of the major disturbances for the operation of offshore production platforms. Slugs can occur, for example, in pipeline-riser systems that transport oil and gas mixture from the seabed to the surface and they are characterized by severe flow and pressure oscillations, with moments of high instantaneous liquid or gas flow, which is then followed by moments of almost no flow. This cyclical phenomenon can cause many problems like reduction in process efficiency, and production losses due to many unplanned shutdowns. One of the ways to minimize issues associated with slugs is to use advanced control techniques in wells. These techniques utilize the available measurements, as downhole pressure (PDG) and top side pressures, to define a choke valve position that minimize or even eliminate slug instability. The objective is to have a stable flow together with the maximum possible production rate. One great challenge for this anti-slug control is how to deal with plant nonlinearity, because the process gain of the system changes drastically at different operating conditions. So, we will discuss in this paper different control algorithms to deal with this problem. This paper will present an anti-slug advanced control, which has three subsystems: one responsible to diagnose and identify slugs, considering some pressures patterns; other to control or minimize slugs; and finally one to protect the process plant in case of severe disturbances. Finally, this paper will show and discuss some economic and safety results of the implementations of these anti-slugs advanced control systems in offshore platforms, emphasizing the benefits obtained, which are related with stability, energy efficiency, and profitability due to a important decreasing in unscheduled compressor shutdown events, as well as increasing in operational efficiency. It will be shown that operators have well accepted this system and are maintaining this controller in automatic mode in more than 80% of the operating time.

AB  - Abstract In mature fields, wells and pipelines are often oversized for the current operating conditions. This is because they have been primarily designed to handle early and midlife production, which may lead to slugging issues in later field life. The resulting flow fluctuations frequently lead to liquid handling problems caused by excessive liquid levels and pressure surges in the first stage separator. This can be an important source of downtime due to facility trips and deferment from sub-optimal facility operations. Furthermore, slugs travelling through topside piping can cause integrity issues when they impact bends. In flowline-riser systems, riser-induced slugging can lead to large slugs, especially in deepwater systems. These can usually not be contained in a platform-based separator.  In such cases gas lift and conventional choking are often used to mitigate slugging. These two methods have drawbacks, however. For gas lift a source of compressed lift gas must be connected to the riser base and the volumes required to mitigate slugging may cause constraints in gas handling. Conventional choking leads to production deferment due to the backpressure imposed by a partially closed choke. In recent years “active” slug control methods have been developed to overcome these drawbacks. One such system is a relatively inexpensive solution developed by Shell Global Solutions known as the Smart Choke. This system has been installed at several locations worldwide and has been proven to be very effective in stabilizing slugging in flowlines and risers. Here, the topside choke is actively controlled to mitigate riser-induced slugging and acts only if flow surges are observed, reducing the peak flow rate into the separator. Between slugs, the choke opens, reducing the imposed backpressure. Since flow fluctuations are reduced, a flowline can be operated at higher average flow rate as the topside facilities can be operated at higher throughputs without risking excessive separator liquid levels. Field data from case histories in the GOM, Malaysia and Nigeria indicate that production gains of 10% are often possible. This paper presents the modeling, implementation and the data obtained from operations of the Smart Choke implementation for a deepwater facility in Nigeria. The objective of the Smart Choke is to stabilize the flow from the riser and to reduce the gas lift requirement. A feasibility study was performed to analyze the slugging behavior of the pipeline and the impact of no control, gas lift and, the combination of gas lift and Smart Choke. Upon favorable modeling results, the Smart Choke was moved to the project stage and implemented. Field data are presented to demonstrate how the Smart Choke was able to control the slugs, reduced gas lift rates and resolve separation issues. As slugging issues become more common worldwide, active slug control methods can provide a low-cost method to mitigate slugging. The effectiveness of such methods in flowline-riser systems has been proven in practice. This technology may provide effective slug mitigation in a wider range of applications in the future, such as horizontal wells suffering from terrain slugging.

AB  - Abstract The flow behavior in hilly terrain pipelines with low flow rates of gas and liquid is gravity dominated. For these conditions, steady or unsteady state flow can prevail, even for constant input gas and liquid mass prevail, even for constant input gas and liquid mass flow rates. The transient behavior of the flow is due to pipeline geometry and the compressible nature of the pipeline geometry and the compressible nature of the gas phase. The result is the occurrence of terrain induced slugging which can cause operational problems. problems. Severe slugging in a pipeline-riser system can be considered as a special case of terrain slugging in hilly terrain pipelines. For this case, the system consists of with a downward inclined section followed by an upward inclined section. Recently, an improved quasi equilibrium model has been developed to simulate the transient flow behavior in pipeline-riser systems. A new model is developed to simulate low velocity flow in hilly terrain pipelines by extending the improved severe slugging analysis. The model is based on fundamental principles and incorporates the physical phenomena. Flow instabilities can inherently physical phenomena. Flow instabilities can inherently be predicted by the model, and a separate stability analysis is not required. The new model developed for low velocity flow in hilly terrain pipelines can be utilized to predict the flow behavior under a wide range of flow conditions, including zero net liquid and gas flow, pipeline start up and shut down practices, the effects of pipeline start up and shut down practices, the effects of pipeline rupture, and variations of inlet flow rates or pipeline rupture, and variations of inlet flow rates or separator pressure. Simulation of a full scale field pipeline is presented to demonstrate the capabilities of pipeline is presented to demonstrate the capabilities of the proposed model. The results show that large amounts of liquid and gas can be produced in a short period of time due to the occurrence of terrain slugging, period of time due to the occurrence of terrain slugging, creating a potential operating problem at the outlet of the pipeline. Introduction Hilly terrain pipelines with low flow rates of gas and liquid are often encountered in nearly depleted fields and fields in their early development stage. The flow in these pipelines is gravity dominated. A description of the system configuration is given in Fig. 1. It consists of sections of upward inclinations (risers) followed by sections with downward slopes (downcomers). The inlet superficial velocities of the gas and the liquid are given by v sL1 and v sg1. The riser lengths are L r1, L r2, ...., L rn with inclination angles of 1, 2, ..., n. P. 25

AB  - A systematic experimental study on two-phase air-water was carried out to evaluate effect of well trajectory on liquid removal in horizontal gas wells. Experiments were conducted in a facility with a 2-in. ID and 62.6-ft. long lateral section and a 41-ft. vertical section, which mimics a horizontal well. Four well configurations were considered; namely, toe-down, toe-up, one-undulation with a sump and one-undulation with a hump. Additionally, different flow conditions were used to simulate the well production as the reservoir pressure depletes. The effect of well trajectory on the liquid removal was evaluated measuring the pressure gradient, liquid holdup, film reversal, and flow pattern. Experimental results indicate that under stable conditions, toe-up is the best configuration for the displacement of the produced fluids from the toe to the kick-off point. However, at very low gas flow rates, severe slugging is observed in this configuration. Furthermore, for the toe-down, one-undulation with a sump, and one- undulation with a hump configurations liquid loading is observed in both lateral and vertical sections of the well. Consequently, significant liquid accumulation and an eventual slugging condition are observed in the well. It was observed that the measured critical gas velocity to avoid liquid loading is lower than gas velocity at the minimum pressure gradient, indicating that minimum pressure gradient criterion is not enough to determine whether the well will be under stable or unstable conditions. Finally, toe-down configuration presents the largest liquid accumulation in the lateral section, indicating lower efficiency to remove liquids from the toe to the kick-off point.

AB  - This presentation was an SPE Distinguished Lecture during 2003-2004.AbstractThe production and storage of natural gas has become a primary focus for many petroleum engineers in all areas of the world. Because of its compressibility and low viscosity, gas is often produced at relatively high velocities, resulting in greatly increased risks of non-Darcy flow effects, friction losses, and erosion-corrosion than is seen in most oil wells.In addition, because of its high mobility, gas can be produced from much lower permeability reservoirs and finer microfractures than would contribute to oil production.This, together with pressure depletion, may lead to some gas wells being produced with relatively low velocities in the wellbore tubulars and flowlines and the associated problems of liquid holdup and severe slugging --- all of which means that gas development and storage operations provides great scope for the petroleum engineer to optimize completions and system operations in order to minimize energy losses and to maximize net present worth and recovery.This talk will address those opportunities and will be tailored to the prevailing conditions in the specific SPE region.

AB  - Abstract Slugging in pipeline-riser systems is becoming more common as the petroleum industry matures. Current trends of developing deepwater fields and producing from marginal fields via subsea tie-backs to existing facilities often lead to slugging. Slugging also occurs in fields approaching end of life, due to decreased gas coupled with increased water productions. Slugging is a major problem for offshore operations because it causes large fluctuations in gas and liquid production which may cause platform trips and riser vibrations. These will lead to production deferment, riser integrity/safety issue, and potential abandonment for fields operating near end of life. The most recent slug control technology in Shell is the Smart Choke. This technology utilizes a single control valve which is installed between the riser top and first stage separator. It is an active slug control device which regulates liquid and gas flow by manipulating the control valve opening. Compared to conventional slug management techniques which require large footprints and high capital/operating costs, Smart Choke is compact and cost-efficient.  Smart Chokes have been installed in the Gulf of Mexico, Nigeria and Malaysia. The pipelines had large fluctuations in pressure and gas/liquid flowrates due to hydraulically unstable flowline/riser system. The installed Smart Chokes were tested to be effective in suppressing riser-induced slugs and controlling slugs initiated within horizontal pipelines. Deployments to-date has shown for example field life extensions of over one year or production gains of about 5 to 10%. This paper presents the implementation of Smart Choke from feasibility study to site implementation in a Malaysian field. It is the first project that integrates Smart Choke control into a platform control system for easier operation. Field data are presented to demonstrate how Smart Choke has extended the field life through the control of slugs. As a result, the shut-in field which was planned for abandonment could continue production. Introduction Pipelines are used in offshore production to transport hydrocarbon fluids in multiphase flow i.e. gas, condensate/oil and water from satellite wells to topside facilities for processing. When producing hydrocarbons in multiphase flow, the outlet of the pipeline may encounter irregular production of the different fluid phases. This irregularity may occur due to changes in operating conditions as the fluid flows through the pipeline, geometrical layout and/or fluid compositions. Major process upsets may occur if the fluctuations in gas and/or liquid production at the end of the pipeline cannot be accommodated by the receiving processing facilities. Large fluctuations in gas/liquid production i.e. slugging, will lead to difficulty in controlling the liquid level at the first stage separator and increase the risk of liquid carryover into the downstream gas processing train. Production may have to be constrained to prevent the gas/liquid fluctuations from exceeding topsides facilities limit.  Severe cases of slugging may also cause platform trips and shutdowns due to high liquid level or high gas pressure, riser vibrations or impact the mechanical integrity of vessel internals. These will lead to production deferment, riser and mechanical integrity/safety concern and potential abandonment for oil/gas fields operating near end of life.

AB  - Abstract Integrated asset modeling has been used for the last decade with a wide technical application covering different challenges from field development to production optimization. Besides supporting the FEEDS and FEL studies for different purposes. Moreover, the technology has evolved in terms of integration and dynamic or transient simulation has been added as an extra element expanding the possibility to cover different challenges and workflows. The objective of this paper is to show how this dynamic integration (Dynamic integrated asset modeling) was applied to a common problem of several reservoirs that produce water and gas under different dynamic mechanisms (injection, aquifer and gas cap) to understand, from the reservoir perspective, the effects of gas and water conning over the entire production system. The methodology applied was using a refined sector model solved with numerical simulation and coupled with a transient multiphase flow simulator to see how pressure drop affect the contacts level and shape based on the petrophysical properties and under different production scenarios and generate different graphics to see how this phenomenon behaves. Besides a comparison with all the most analytical correlations used in the literature to identify gas and water conning was performed to see the differences among them and with this dynamic integrated approach. On the other hand, for the production side this coupled model was applied to an offshore facility to see these reservoir effects in the transport system and how they impact in the pipeline and riser due to this abrupt entrance of gas and water changing the flow conditions, flow patterns, pressure drop and creating some instabilities in the separators caused by severe slugging. The results of this analysis were very useful to understand the total production systems (reservoir-surface) behavior, predict the gas and water breakthrough, establish the critical rates to avoid these problems and see how the results differ in some cases with the common analytical correlations. Specific conditions in the pipeline and riser were established to quantify the slugging problems and evaluate different alternatives to eliminate the instabilities through proposing different scenarios such as gas injection in the riser, top side choking, etc. Application of this integrated approach has been very beneficial in recognizing the source of the problem, offer proper and feasible solutions in development and operational phases. In addition, validating and reducing uncertainty of related literature correlations and give to the production and reservoir engineers a quick and reliable way to know the critical rates that can support the decision-making process.

AB  - SummaryThis paper discusses the reasons for developing a pump capable of pumping gas/liquid mixtures. Preliminary trials that led to the design, construction, and testing of a full-specification pump are described.IntroductionAll oil wells produce a mixture of hydrocarbon fluids that, when reduced to atmospheric pressure, partially vaporize to give a mixture of gas and liquid. Until now, it has been common for the gas to be flared and only the liquid to be retained for further treatment. Finite energy resources, restrictions on flaring, and the increasing value of the gas frequently make such procedures unacceptable.The separation and treatment of gas/liquid mixtures close to the wellhead may be costly and operationally inconvenient. Transport in a multiphase pipeline to a central treatment station is possible but may require higher pressure than is available at the wellhead. In this case, it is currently necessary to separate the liquid and gas, pump the liquid, compress the gas separately, and recombine the streams.A multiphase pump offers an alternative that likely has a lower capital cost.Outline Requirements of the PumpA number of case studies suggested the following broad requirements. The pump should be capable of pumping up to 40,000B/D [265-m3/h] total suction volume. Its differential pressure should be up to 500 psi [3.45 MPa], and it should have an ANSI Class 900 casing-pressure rating. The pump should be able to withstand up to 260°F [127°C] pumping temperature. The pump should have a proven corrosion resistance against hot salt water with the presence of H2S and CO2 and a proven erosion resistance against small quantities of sand (up to 751bm/l,000 bbl [214 g/m3]). The pump should handle a gas volume fraction, defined as the volume of gas at suction conditions divided by the volume of gas plus liquid at suction conditions, of up to approximately 90%. The pump should withstand severe slugging.Selection of Pumping PrincipleThe high gas fraction immediately rules out the use of any kind of rotodynamic pump. In principle, any positive-displacement pump could handle gas/liquid mixtures, but the service conditions eliminate most pump types. Thus, for the required capacity, piston and plunger pumps would be very large and would need to be run slowly to avoid shock. The presence of sand rules out pumps that depend on a sliding motion in contact with the pumped fluid - e.g., vane pumps and screw pumps without timing gears-and the combination of capacity and differential pressure rules out gear and lobe pumps. The presence of hydrocarbons renders the suitability of progressing-cavity pumps with elastomeric stators doubtful. It is possible to use metallic stators for these pumps, but the necessary clearances involve a loss in volumetric efficiency. The required capacity would necessitate the building of a pump larger than any built to date. The twin-screw pump with timing gears had already been built for such capacities and differential pressures - e.g., for fuel oil in a U.K. power station. The casing-pressure rating was thought to be only a matter of designing a stronger casing than had been required previously.The use of external timing gears should minimize the wear of components by abrasives. Assessment of susceptibility to wear is difficult, but experience suggests that this type of pump has a reasonably long life in mildly abrasive environments. The use of external timing gears also gives it the ability to run dry.Thus, the twin-screw pump was felt to offer a suitable combination of properties. Although considerable development would be required, it would be less than for any other pump type. A further factor in the selection of the twin-screw pump was the existence of experience with gas/liquid mixtures.1,2Confirmation of Pumping PrincipleTo verify that twin-screw pumps would be capable of pumping mixtures with such a high gas fraction, a simple test rig was set up with a standard Size 95 (scroll diameter in millimeters) twinscrew pump, water as the test liquid, and air from the works compressed-air system as the gas. Trials supported the theoretically based expectations.1. Volumetric efficiency was similar to that on water alone at the same differential pressure. The volumetric efficiency of a positive-displacement machine is defined as the volume pumped measured at suction conditions divided by pump swept volume.2. Power consumption was not changed significantly by the presence of gas.3. Both of these statements were true up to the highest gas fractions tested (approximately 90%).Formation of Joint VentureAt this stage, potential business needs had been identified and the feasibility of pumping gas/liquid mixtures with a twin-screw pump had been demonstrated. A joint venture was therefore formed to develop the concept. Partners in the joint venture were BP Petroleum Development Ltd., Stothert and Pitt plc, Mobil North Sea Ltd., and Shell (U.K.) E&P. Financial support was also provided by the Dept. of Trade and Industry.

AB  - Abstract Flow assurance is critical and difficult for deepwater pipeline since the seawater temperature, surrounding pipeline, is usually much colder than the surface air temperature. In the deepwater, the fluid heat can be quickly lost to the water if there is no thermal insulation layer surrounding the pipe wall. When the inner wall temperature falls below the crude oil cloud point temperature, wax deposition occurs. Such problem starts when paraffin components in crude oil precipitate and deposit on the cold pipeline wall. Whereas wax precipitation during oil flow results in wax deposition and flow restriction, wax precipitation during a production shutdown results in problems when attempting to restart the flow.   In this review, wax deposition problem in flow and during the shut-in conditions are discussed. Also, proposed wax deposition physics and mechanisms are outlined. Furthermore, different wax deposition mitigation techniques are explained. These techniques include: Cold Flow, Chemical Additives and Different Pipes and Coatings Techniques. In addition, different wax deposition removal techniques are reviewed. These techniques include: Fused Chemical Reaction, Mechanical Techniques, Heat Application, Chemical Additives, Magnetic Fluid Conditioning (MFC) technology and Use of Microbial Products.   Introduction Risks associated with the transportation of multiphase fluids are the most critical operational hazards of offshore pipelines. When water, oil, and gas are flowing inside the pipeline simultaneously, few potential problems can occur. Such problems include, but not limited to: wax and asphaltene can deposit on the wall and may eventually block the pipeline. In addition, water and hydrocarbon fluids can form hydrate and block the pipeline, Furthermore, with high enough water cut, corrosion may occur. Also, scales may form and deposit inside the pipeline and restrict the flow. Moreover, with pressure and temperature changes along the pipeline and/or with incompatible water mixing and severe slugging may form inside the pipeline and cause operational problems to downstream processing facilities. The challenge that engineers will face is, thus, how to design the pipeline and subsea system to assure that multiphase fluids will be safely and economically transported from the bottom of the wells all the way to the downstream processing plant.

AB  - Multiphase flow-induced dynamic loads in rigid tie-in spool are mainly generated by fluid density variation, slugging, and direction change at bends. When the frequencies of the induced dynamic loads are close to the natural frequencies of the rigid tie-in spool, resonance will occur. This may cause significant strength and fatigue issues, and should therefore be included in the rigid tie-in spool system design. In this paper, a procedure for assessing structural response of a tie-in spool using fluid-structure interaction (FSI) method is introduced to investigate the internal multiphase flow-induced vibration and fatigue damage due to fluid density change, slugging, and direction change at bends. A numerical example to demonstrate the procedure are also included. In the procedure, the rigid tie-in spool structural mode shapes and natural frequencies are first determined by FEA. Then, the inlet slug frequencies are selected based on the natural frequencies of the tie-in spool. Finally, coupled CFD and structure analysis are carried out to calculate the stress and stress range at the critical locations of the rigid tie-in spool for strength and fatigue evaluation. In the coupled CFD and structure analysis, fluid-induced loads due to fluid density variation, slugging, and flow direction change at bends are all included. For the numerical example, a typical tie-in spool is selected. Star CCM is used as CFD software for multiphase flow-induced load analysis. ABAQUS is used as structure software for mode shape and FSI analysis for strength and fatigue evaluation. The proposed procedure together with the numerical example provides an in-depth understanding of the resonance effect on strength and fatigue for a typical rigid tie-in spool. It also demonstrates the importance of applying the FSI method to the rigid tie-in spool system design when slugging and resonance are expected.

AB  - This work is based on simulation of a typical deepwater oil field in West-Africa over 1000m depth, which is subject to hydrodynamic slugging at its early life. Sensitivity analysis was carried out to simulate the impact of increasing depth and diameter on the field with the same fluid composition and slight variation in pressure and mass flow conditions. Based on US MMS, fields found in water depth of 1000 ft (305m) and above are termed deepwater fields. Typically, for deepwater oil fields the ambient temperature is low giving room for formation of compounds such as hydrates and wax. Also of critical concern is the increasing depth associated with deepwater oil fields which leads to increasing hydrostatic pressure and its associated tendency for slugging formation. Increasing diameter has the tendency to lead to a drop in fluid velocity. However, there are still speculations as to the exact effect of increasing diameter on flow instability which is one of the main aspects of the present work [1]. An understanding of the multiphase flow phenomenon as well as the overall potential effects on the processing facilities is required in the design of the multiphase flowlines. An under-design or overdesign of the piping can be counterproductive and may significantly affect the process plant operability. Therefore emphasis is placed on understanding completely, flow assurance issues in the multiphase flow; especially slugging phenomenon as flowline-riser system diameter and depth is increased.

AB  - AbstractLedaFlow® is a new transient multiphase flow simulator which includes 1Dmulti-fluid models consisting of mass, momentum and energy conservationequations for each field (continuous, bubble and droplet), as well ascompositional tracking. In this paper, a new method called Slug Capturing isemployed for slug flow, and the results analyzed and compared with the fielddata of two different fields. Additionally, for some cases, differences betweenthe new simulator and another commercially available transient code results arecompared and analyzed.The first case corresponds to the production of a TOTAL-operated field in theUK. Produced fluids from the wells are transported through a 21 km long,16-inch multiphase flowline from the well platforms to the central receivingfacilities. The multiphase line (gas/oil/water) must be operated in a narrowrange of pressure and flow rate conditions in order to avoid severe sluggingissues. Flow patterns are compared for various water cuts and superficial gasvelocities. When severe slugging is observed, slug characteristics (frequency,length) are analyzed and compared to simulator predictions.The second case is from a CONOCOPHILLIPS-operated North Sea asset. The 3-phase,18-inch ID oil flow line runs 3.7 km from a wellhead platform to a centralprocessing platform. The line drops approximately 6 m over the last 3 km beforeflowing up a 130 m riser. The pipeline exhibits severe riser slugging which isnot adequately modeled by conventional transient models, due to the complexinterplay between hydrodynamic and riser slugging, as well as 3-phase effects.Slug frequencies and lengths are analyzed and compared to predictions.BackgroundThe LedaFlow 1D ModelIn this paper, the LedaFlow® 1D Slug Capturing model has been used to simulatethe field cases. The 1D model employs a three-fluid-nine-field modeling conceptto simulate the thermo- and hydrodynamics of the gas-oil-water three-phase flowin pipeline systems. In this approach, the various phases are assumed to flowin continuous zones and in the form of dispersed droplets within another zone.For instance, oil is transported in the form of continuous oil, oil droplets inthe water zone, and oil droplets in the gas zone. In a three-phase situation,the flow generally consists of three zones and nine fields. The momentum andenergy conservation equations are solved for each of the three zones, while themass equation is solved for all nine fields, yielding 15 conservation equationsaltogether.

AB  - AbstractA computerized monitoring system has been developed for the 48 kilometer long 20 inch TOGI gas condensate pipeline in the North Sea. The system, which is based on the transient multiphase flow computer code OLGA, provides means for forecasting pipeline behavior, simulating a 4 hour period ahead in time every 10 minutes. The real-time part of the simulator handles algorithms for leak detection, hydrate blockage detection, liquid inventory tracking and monitoring of a number of other parameters.The paper gives details on system design and algorithms used. IntroductionUnprocessed gas condensate well fluids have been transported in field flow lines for a number of years. In recent years the technology has been extended to transport unprocessed well stream over long distances with more complex fluids and in cold environments. Long pipelines carrying an unprocessed well stream are potentially prone to severe slugging and hydrate formation. Often such pipelines are designed such that operation must be confined to a narrow operational envelope in order to achieve smooth operation. For multiphase pipelines as for single phase pipelines it is also desirable to have leak detection as well as monitoring of pipeline operational parameters in general. Monitoring of multiphase pipelines is desirable both in terms of safety and flexibility. Monitoring systems for single phase pipelines are commercially available. For multiphase lines, however, the market for monitoring systems is meager. A computerized monitoring system based on the transient multiphase flow computer code OLGA has been developed to carry out monitoring of the Troll Oseberg Gas Injection (TOGI) pipeline in the Norwegian sector of the North Sea. The TOGI pipeline transports unprocessed gas from a sub sea installation at the Troll Field through a 20" pipeline 48 km to the Oseberg Field. There the gas is processed, compressed and injected into the gas cap of the Oseberg reservoir. The gas injection improves the total oil recovery by more than 7% over the originally planned water injection system. The fluid has a liquid drop out of approximately 4.5% (wt) at typical pipeline conditions. Liquid water is not produced, but is condensing out in the pipeline. Figure 1 shows the key parameters for the pipeline system. Production startup is planned for early 1991. System OverviewMultiphase Flow ModelThe flow model applied in the monitoring system is the transient multiphase flow simulator OLGA developed in the SINTEF-IFE Two-Phase Flow Research Project. OLGA is a dynamic one dimensional model for two-phase hydrocarbon flow in pipelines and pipeline networks [3,4]. The model is unified, handling four different flow regimes without user specified correlations. OLGA calculates the transient state all along the pipeline, such as pressure, temperature, liquid and gas flow, liquid holdup, flow regimes, etc. It is particularly well suited to simulate rather slow mass flow transients, and handles well the periodic phenomenon of terrain induced slugging. The implicit time integration scheme allows for long time steps, order of magnitudes longer than those of an explicit method. The model includes a pig tracking function.

AB  - This article, written by JPT Technology Editor Chris Carpenter, contains highlights of paper SPE 170731, “Increasing Production by Applying Field-Proven Active Slug- Suppression Technology,” by C.E. Lacy, SPE, G.A. Groote, and R. Chao, Shell; E. Osemwinyen, Nigeria NLNG; and F.A. Fleyfel, SPE, and O. Akinmoladum, Shell, prepared for the 2014 SPE Annual Technical Conference and Exhibition, Amsterdam, 27–29 October. The paper has not been peer reviewed. Active slug-control methods have been developed in recent years. One such system is a relatively inexpensive solution developed by Shell that has proved to be very effective in stabilizing slugging in flowlines and risers. Field data from case histories in the Gulf of Mexico (GOM), Malaysia, and Nigeria indicate that production gains of 10% are often possible. Introduction The active slug-control method in question uses a single standard control valve and pressure sensors immediately upstream and downstream of the valve. One advantage of this method is that a choke/ control valve is often already installed. If changes are required, these are often limited to the trim and actuator. Because only localized pressure measurements are required, this makes the technology a cost-effective solution with very limited added weight or space requirements. Another advantage is that the system acts on both liquid and gas surges of the multiphase fluid without the need for prior separation. It can thus stabilize the fluids arriving at the production facility, allowing for optimization and increased production. In this paper, a new application in Nigeria is discussed in which this active slug-suppression technology reduced the gas and liquid surges and lowered riser gas lift requirements. Riser-base gas lift is often used both to reduce hydrostatic head and to mitigate slugging in subsea applications. In this case, the asset was gas lift constrained and the gas lift was insufficient to mitigate slugging below a fixed flow-rate range. Lowering gas lift requirements meant more barrels could be produced across the asset. Reducing slugging would enable lower minimal production limits. Technology The concept of active slug control is several decades old. This latest technology, however, uses a single control valve— typically the boarding choke—located between the outlet of the riser and the first stage separator. A control algorithm especially designed for slug control was developed that incorporates the measurements of the pressure upstream and downstream of the control valve. The first objective of the control system is to suppress riser-induced slugging. Here, riser-induced slugging (sometimes referred to as severe slugging) is characterized by the formation of a blockage beginning at the riser base. As the blockage forms, the gas production starts to decrease at the top of the riser and may stop completely. Eventually, a liquid slug arrives at the facility followed immediately by a gas surge. Once the gas surge is produced, the cycle then repeats itself. The control system can be used to minimize the impact coming from many types of transient slugs. Transient slugs can occur for a variety of reasons. These include start-up or ramp-up slugs and slugs resulting from dips in the elevation profile allowing alternating accumulation and blowout of liquids and slugs from instabilities either in the horizontal flowline or vertical riser.

AB  - AbstractBijupirÃ¡ & Salema field is located in the Campos Basin offshore Brazil in water depths ranging from 600 to 800 meters. A consortium led by Enterprise Oil and its partners, Odebrecht and Petrobras, is developing the fields. The two fields will be developed as subsea tiebacks to an FPSO with offset distances ranging from 2 to 3 km. The system comprises subsea manifolds, flowlines and risers with capability for round trip pigging. The paper will provide a brief overview of the main flow assurance challenges. Two of the flow assurance challenges highlighted include hydrates management and liquid slugging.During various production operations, produced fluids can potentially be cooled by the surrounding cold water, resulting in gas hydrates. Such blockages can plug the bore of the subsea tree, tree piping, well jumper, manifolds, flowlines and risers, causing loss of production and inability to open or close subsea valves. The hydrate management philosophy for this project considered the following: Use a combination of chemical injection using either ethanol or methanol and thermal insulation. Thermal insulation on subsea production system to provide sufficient cool down time without operator action. For long-term unplanned shut down, flowlines and risers can be depressurized and displaced. Circulate "dry" hot oil in the flowlines and risers prior to re-start. Hydrate inhibitor injection into the subsea system during start up and shut down.Liquid slug behavior is another important consideration in the design of the production system. Large liquid slugs arriving at the FPSO can cause several problems, such as exceeding the capacity of the topsides separators, impact loads on topsides piping and swivels, vibration of risers, and erratic well flow behavior. Severe slugging is likely in the Salema flowlines due to the combination of downhill profile from the manifold towards the riser base and the potentially low flow rates expected.This paper will present an overview of the selection and design process adopted to manage hydrates and liquid slugging for this field development considering system thermal and hydraulic performance, cost and ease of field installation and production operations.System OverviewBijupirá and Salema fields are located in the Campos basin offshore Brazil located approximately 250 km East of Rio de Janeiro. Water depth in the field ranges from 600 to 800 meters. The fields combined have estimated recoverable reserves of around 170 million barrels of oil in place and associated gas. The undersaturated reservoirs are at around 2,900 meters below the seabed. It is considered a "lowenergy" reservoir. Therefore, the development includes combination of water injection and gas-lift to produce the wells at the target rates.Figure 1 shows an overall field layout of the subsea system. Bijupira field is being developed with six producers plus one contingency and four water injectors. Salema field consists of three producers and two water injectors. The FPSO is positioned approximately in the middle of the field with offset distances between the subsea drill centers ranging from 2 to 3 km.

AB  - ABSTRACT Slug flow continues to be a disruptive influence on both design and operation of multiphase pipelines and risers. In the past, the focus was largely on slugging cycles driven by the riser or driven by large scale terrain effects which were ultimately accommodated through slug catcher design, gas lift deployment, passive or active slug control measures. The current challenge is to resolve the much higher frequency hydrodynamic slug flow in order to support fatigue analysis within mechanical design of free spans, and risers, which have low tolerance to cyclic loads. This paper will examine the use of tools capable of predicting the formation of hydrodynamic slugs within a production system and following their evolution with length and interaction with terrain. The challenges of routine deployment of such methods in support of design or operations will be considered. INTRODUCTION In the past, the need for modelling slug flow was largely focussed around modelling severe slugging cycles and large scale liquid movement events due to restart, ramp-up or pigging, in order that the behaviour could be aligned with the capability of the downstream process plant. Such slugs, and event driven liquid movement, may be accommodated using large vessels, mitigated through operating procedures which change the system in a more gradual manner, or managed using gas injection or other active or passive slug control systems [1].

AB  - ABSTRACTThe present work investigates the ability of the available 1D multi-phase flow simulators MAST [1] and OLGA [2] to reproduce measured field data on the offshore Heidrun oil field located in the North Sea. The production is tied back from two subsea templates through two 5km long 10’’ near horizontal pipelines and two ~400 m high risers to the Heidrun TLP. Several tests were conducted at different separator pressures (32-52 bara) and inlet oil flow rates (3000-4700 Sm3/d) by applying a gamma densitometer downstream the riser top, just upstream the separator. For the range of test conditions the reported flow regimes are wavy-stratified flow, hydrodynamic slugging and severe slugging. For the slug flow regimes the gamma densitometer traces are used to back-calculate the relevant slug characteristics, such as the slug void, the slug body and unit length, slug velocity and frequency. When slugging occurs, analysis of the data indicates that the aeration in the slug is fairly high, around 50%, indicating that the gas entrainment into the liquid slug plays an important role in determining the relevant features of the resulting slug flow regime. Detailed flow simulator analysis of the field data show that a one-dimensional description of these phenomena can lead to a fair agreement with the data provided that the adopted closure laws are appropriate for the physical problem under investigation.

AB  - ABSTRACT Predictions from multiple industrial simulators of multiphase pipeline flow are compared to field data for a hilly terrain, gas-condensate pipeline with three-phase flow. Field conditions studied include quasi-steady flow and ramp-up slugging. Some models predict excessive terrain-induced slugging for which there is little evidence in the field. The models that do not predict such predominant slugging are less accurate than others in predicting the timing and volume of ramp-up slugs. It is argued that these deficiencies of model prediction result from insufficiently accurate calculation of even steady-state holdups under conditions of large pipe inclination and three-phase flow. Other comparisons across simulators, and against experimental or field data, suggest that divergences in prediction are attributable to a few aspects of modelling, such as regime transitions, interfacial friction, and liquid-liquid dispersal.

AB  - SummaryThe aim of the Good-fellow Assocs. subsea production (GASP) project was todevelop a sub-sea production system for use in the development of marginalfields. The project was divided into three phases that culminated in testing aprototype system in a dry dock. The GASP system enables manifolding ofproducts, separation of gas from produced liquids, and transportation of gasand liquids through separate lines. The produced liquids are pumped with asingle-phase pumping system that is highly modularized for ease of installationand retrieval of key components. GASP is suitable for deep-water applicationand development of marginal fields far from the host platform. The economicswere assessed with probabilistic methods to weigh the uncertainties. Developingmarginal fields with the GASP system looks attractive, offering a developmentcost of $2.50 to $5.50 per barrel in many typical instances.IntroductionGASP was a joint industry project supported by the European Community andeight major oil companies: Agip (U.K.), Chevron (U.K.), Conoco (U.K.),Elf(U.K.), Norsk Hydro, Phillips Petroleum (U.K.), Statoil, and Texaco (U.K.).The project was developed under three phases. Phase 1. Nov. 1986-Nov. 1987:conceptual development of the subsea production/process system. Phase 2. Nov.1987-Feb. 1989: detailed design of prototype system and material procurement.procurement. Phase 3. Jan. 1989-May 1990: installation and testing of theprototype system in a dry dock.ObjectivesThe main objectives of the project were (1) to develop a subseaproduction/processing system suitable for development of marginal fields; (2)to identify the key components of the system, their requirements, and the stateof the an for their application; (3) to address all major operational aspectsto establish the viability, applications, and limitations of the system; (4) touse the GASP system to prepare a cost estimate for the development of a fieldand to establish the economic viability of the system; and (5) to demonstratethe operation and control of a prototype system to confirm system viabilityprototype system to confirm system viability and to identify areas requiringfurther development or modifications for future field applications.Why Subsea Production and Processing? Production and Processing? Developmentof marginal fields with conventional bottom-supported jackets and floatingproduction systems, in most cases, is uneconomical because of their highcapital cost. The economics are affected further by the development of fieldsthat are located in deep waters and have one or more of the followingcharacteristics: (1) reservoir conditions demanding several satellite wells forthe recovery of field reserves; (2) low production rates associated with lowPI; (3) production rates associated with low PI; (3) limited total recoverablereserves, typically ranging from 10 to 100 million bbl oil; (4) low productionpressure and rapid pressure decline, requiring water injection and gas lift asan additional aid to enhance recovery; and (5) high water cut, reaching 70% to80% oftheproductionneartheendofthe field life. These conditions can beaggravated further by uncertainties in reservoir behavior, the presence of H2Sand CO2, waxy crude oil, and production of sand. An economic solution is tominimize the capital cost and to use the existing nearby facilities as much aspossible. This approach entails transporting the products for processing andexport to the host platform. processing and export to the host platform. Ainmost cases where production from several wells is involved, manifolding theproducts subsea becomes necessary to save the cost of pipelines over longdistances. Transporting well products in a multiphase (gas and liquids) stateover long distances poses a number of problems, including severe poses a numberof problems, including severe slugging and pressure fluctuations. Theseconditions also have an affect on the design and capacity of the topsideprocess facilities that need to cope with the expected slug and plug flowconditions. plug flow conditions. Loss of pressure along the pipelines as aresult of friction and head losses often limits the production life and subseaboosting of the products becomes necessary. Near the end of the field life, ahigh water cut means that head losses dominate. For deepwater production, wherea significant difference production, where a significant difference exists inseabed elevation between the sub-seaproduction system and the host platformhead losses may form more than 90% of the total losses along the line. Notethat for deepwater fields, even if conventional production platforms are used,head losses along the riser will restrict the production rate through theentire life of the production rate through the entire life of the field unlesssome form of downhole or sub sea boosting is included. In most cases, theproduced hydrocarbons are well below their produced hydrocarbons are well belowtheir bubblepoint when they reach the wellhead, and gas/liquid ratios can rangefrom 3% to greater than 90% during the production life of the field.

AB  - AbstractDue to tubular corrosion of a gas lifted completion on the Arbroath field, the well was unable to flow due to the well shallow gas lifting through holes in the tubing. Since the Arbroath platform is a rigless platform, a full workover was considered a costly operation with prohibitive lead times. For that reason less costly and innovative through tubing repair options were considered to allow the well to be returned to production. After considering several options a coiled tubing straddle insert was chosen as the preferred repair method to meet the success criteria for the job.The straddle consisted of 3 1/2" coil with hydraulic set packers at either end and was successfully run inside the existing 4 1/2" completion to seal off the corroded section of tubing allowing the well to return to production. This paper describes the repair options considered, the design, planning and installation of the coiled tubing straddle and the subsequent post repair well results.IntroductionThe Arbroath Field lies in the central North Sea in Block 22/17 next to the adjacent Montrose field. It is an undersaturated oil reservoir and produces a 38 deg API oil from the Forties sandstone. Pressure maintenance is by means of water injection and natural aquifer support. The field currently has a total of 17 wells, 14 producers and 3 injectors with all the producers with the exception of one being produced using gas lift. Current production is around 45,000 b/d of oil and 11,000 b/d of water.The Arbroath platform was designed as a not normally manned platform remotely controlled from the neighboring Montrose platform although it is currently permanently manned. It is a minimum facilities platform with the bulk of processing taking place on the neighboring Montrose platform. There is a single separator on the Arbroath platform where two phase separation takes place. Oil/water and gas are then sent via separate pipelines to the Montrose platform. for further processing. Injection water and gas lift gas are supplied via two further subsea pipelines from the Montrose platform making a total of four subsea pipelines running between Montrose and Arbroath.The Arbroath platform was designed without a permanent rig onboard. The initial platform wells were drilled using a Giant Jack-up which was situated alongside the platform to allow the rig to skid across to the platform.Arbroath Well CompletionA typical Arbroath well completion is shown in figure 1. It is a gas lift completion with gas lift gas injected down the 9 5/8" casing to tubing annulus. It comprises 4 1/2, L80 tubing with primary components of a production packer, expansion joint, shallow set annular safety system and tubing safety valve. The wells are installed with 7 gas lift mandrels fitted with annulus pressure operated gas lift valves and an orifice valve at the operating depth. The wells are operated with a surface gas injection pressure of 1500 psig. The wells originally flowed naturally from production start-up in 1990 but were put onto gas lift in late 1993/early 1994.Background to Production Problems with Well T4 During late 1994 well T4 developed severe slugging problems and had great difficulty in flowing especially after a shutdown. T4 was flowing at around 3000 b/d of oil and a water cut of 30%.P. 335

AB  - Abstract A mechanistic model has been developed for the rate of initiation of hydrodynamic slugs and has been coupled with improvements in the closure models for slug flow. The resulting Slug Tracking simulator is capable of predicting the slug frequency and slug length distribution, and their evolution along a long pipeline. The simulations are validated against published laboratory data, against data from the large scale Tiller loop, and against field data. For field cases, computed slug lengths and frequencies are typically within a factor of two of measured values; the frequencies compare favourably with the best available correlations. Introduction Slug flow is a commonly occurring phenomenon in hydrocarbon production pipelines and many other process applications. Slugs can form for a variety of reasons, including operational slugging, terrain and severe slugging, and hydrodynamic slugging. Dynamic multiphase flow simulators for long flowlines typically operate with a coarse grid (spacing of order 100 times the pipe diameter or more) and correspondingly large time steps. Nevertheless, they can generally capture phenomena associated with operational, terrain, and severe slugging, since the associated time and length scales are large. In contrast, hydrodynamic slugs arise from short length-scale phenomena, developing from large waves with steep gradients over length scales of the order of the pipe diameter. Even though hydrodynamic slugs are initially quite short, the distribution of slug lengths can evolve substantially as the slugs propagate through long, undulating pipelines, sometimes leading to the formation of very long slugs, with associated problems at the receiving facilities. Furthermore hydrodynamic slugging can interact with terrain slugging in complex ways, leading to difficulties in predicting the onset and amplitude of large-scale flow instabilities. Additionally, all slugs, short or long, lead to unsteady loads on pipes and equipment, which can contribute to fatigue failure. For these reasons, it is very important to have accurate predictions of slug length and frequency. Some progress has been made with “Slug Capturing” approaches, which attempt to resolve the two-fluid equations on a fine grid (1, 2, 3), 4, 5, 6). However, the underlying mathematical model is only conditionally well-posed, so that a mathematical solution may not exist, and the simulation results may not converge as the grid is refined. The model can be made well-posed by adding interfacial pressure or diffusion terms, but these modify the short-lengthscale features of the flow in a way that may not be physically realistic. Furthermore, the application of these simulations is severely limited by the very large computational cost for simulation of full-scale pipeline systems over operational timescales.

AB  - AbstractFlow Assurance started to be a concern in PETROBRAS in the mid 80's, with the development of the Albacora Field, which was the first field produced at a water depth below 400 meters in Campos Basin. Since that time, PETROBRAS relies heavily on technological research and development to provide solutions that can grant the safe, continuous and optimized operation of its subsea fields. This paper reviews the efforts regarding Flow Assurance Management in Campos Basin, under a historical point of view, following the new challenges that were posed as water depths became deeper and deeper, and the techniques and practices developed to face them. Also are reported here the current R&D efforts under the PROCAP- 3000 program, aiming to address Flow Assurance Management in water depths up to 3,000 meters (9,840 ft). IntroductionSince Flow Assurance started to be a concern in PETROBRAS in the mid 80's, with the development of the Albacora field, large investments have been made in R&D, through the PROCAP program, aiming to make viable the production and pipeline transportation of oil in this harsh environment, at water depths below 400 meters in Campos Basin. This scenario is where the occurrence of waxes, hydrates, asphaltenes and scale become a critical issue. The first challenge faced in the beginning of the production of the Albacora Field was to keep the continuous operation of the pilot production system, which was not originally designed to handle the large degree of wax deposition that was taking place in the production lines. The first solution was to change the production line, which was very expensive and did not really solve the problem. This challenge was overcome with the in-house development of the thermo-chemical method known as SGNTM ?Nitrogen eneration System. The lessons learned with this pilot system were the driven forces of the development of methods to predict and prevent wax deposition, which will be discussed in this paper. These methods incorporated a new way to design the production system, and were eventually used with success in the development projects of subsequent fields in Campos Basin, such as Marlim and Roncador. When the development of Marlim took place, in the early 90's, already reaching water depths of 1,000 meters (3,280 ft) and below, cases of hydrate formation started to appear, initially in the completion phase. With the increase of the BSW in the production phase, hydrate formation in production lines and subsea equipment also became a problem. Taking a similar strategy to the one used for dealing with wax deposition in Albacora, PETROBRAS invested in the research and development of methods to predict, prevent and control hydrate formation in the production of deep offshore fields. Nowadays in PETROBRAS, and particularly in Campos Basin, Flow Assurance is still a problem and a challenge for this production scenario. But the learning process and the investment made in R&D turned the Flow Assurance Management a well-developed and successful issue, which extends its scope beyond the waxes and hydrates formation phenomena, dealing also with strategies to control scaling, emulsions, asphaltenes and severe slugging as well.

AB  - AbstractRiser base gas-lift is one of several methods that have been proven to work in subsea developments for production enhancement. In addition, gas-lift can be used as an effective method to suppress severe slugging that usually occurs in flowlines with downhill inclination. In some cases, gas-lift can be used to increase feasibility of blowdown for hydrate prevention.Meanwhile, the necessity of gas-lift application is not always obvious because gas-lift effectiveness depends on reservoir performance, fluid properties, seabed terrain, subsea architecture, and flowline and riser specifications. In many cases, gas-lift for production enhancement is only needed at late life production, when oil production rates are low and water rates might be high enough. It is clear that the necessity of gas-lift, optimal operability and system design should be assessed from various aspects, including flow assurance. Whether gas-lift suitable as an artificial lift method and where the lift-gas should be injected needs to be evaluated very early in the project development lift cycle. Often, decisions need to be made with a very limited analysis to screen different development concepts, and whether to use gas-lift or not is one such decision.based on the past experience of riser gas-lift applications for different deepwater subsea projects and based the associated multiphase flow phenomena, a generic set of guidelines was developed. These include when gas-lift is beneficial for production enhancement, for flow stability and for flow assurance. Also, factors affecting the selection of a location for lift-gas injection, and the nature of the lift-gas supply method (dedicated vs. shared gas-lift risers, insulated vs. noninsulated gas-lift systems and gas-lift system functionalities needed) are discussed. IntroductionThis paper discusses the riser base gas-lift used in deepwater, subsea oil production systems. The information presented here is drawn from currently producing subsea systems as well as from those that are still in design stage. This paper does not discuss downhole gas-lift used in DVA (direct vertical access) or subsea wells, where challenges with regard to gas-lift application may appear quite different from those that are in the riser base gas-lift. The primary focus of this paper is to describe how flow assurance concerns affect various engineering decisions, in designing a gas-lift system.Riser base gas-lift is injection of a pre-determined rate of gas into the production flowline (or riser) on the sea floor. Obviously, this applied to oil producing systems only. This injected gas is provided from the host facility, through a gaslift riser. The reasons for gas-lifting can vary, but the most important with regard to flow assurance are: Production enhancement Flow stabilization Flowline depressurizationGas-lift for production enhancement is usually used for cases where water cut is high and/or the reservoir fluid GOR or reservoir pressure is low. Lift-gas decreases the liquid holdup in the riser, and thus reduces the hydrostatic pressure in the flowline.

AB  - AbstractThis paper presents and discusses the results of field testing gas injection into a hilly terrain crude pipeline, and applicable transient multiphase flow simulations. Field testing was conducted to evaluate the effectiveness of using gas injection into a multiphase pipeline operating under severe slugging to reduce pressure losses and increase well rates.Transient flow simulations were used to predict pipeline pressure losses and select a line for testing. The gas injection method effectively decreased the pipeline pressure about 20 % at the inlet, allowing increased oil production from wells connected to the pipeline inlet. Predicted pressure drop reduction closely matched measurements. The drop in pressure losses is due to reduced liquid holdup in the uphill sections of the line.Hydrostatic and frictional pressure drops need to be carefully considered to properly operate pipelines under slug flow. Injecting gas into oil pipelines experiencing slug flow can improve oil transport efficiency by reducing pressure losses, increase well rates productivity, and mitigate slug effects on receiving producing facilities. A transient multiphase flow simulator (TMFS) can accurately predict crude oil pipeline pressure drop improvement prior to gas injection.IntroductionThe field topography is composed of stable sabkhas (flat surface portions of different sizes and shapes fully surrounded by sand dunes), and sand dunes up to 200 meters high. The sabkhas are identified with a serial number and used as drilling islands to spot horizontal wells and other producing facilities. Wet crude is free-flowed from producing wells to three Gas Oil Separator Plants (GOSPs) located at sabkhas in the north, south and central part of the field. Produced crude free-flows from wells through a network of flowlines and trunklines to three processing facilities located at the north (GOSP-1), south (GOSP-3) and the Central Processing Facility (CPF).The north and south satellite GOSP's have one-stage and the CPF has three-stage separation capacity. The three processing facilities receive crude into High Pressure Production Traps (HPPT) to separate gas from the oil at 280 psig. The reservoir driving mechanism combines solution gas, a large gas cap and partial water drive; in addition, the separated gas is re-injected into the gas cap. Reservoir rock quality tapers off from north to south, which further emphasizes the pipeline high pressure drop's negative effects on the lower producers located in the southern part. This study will focus on the trunkline G2ST4 crossing Sabkha Nos. 70, 62 and 57 (S-70, S-62 and S-57).The slug flow resulting from terrain elevation changes increase the wellhead back pressures in the oilfield abnormally, particularly at low flows (rates) and at remote locations, sometimes limiting low pressure producers. Severe slug flow regime produces irregular periods of low liquid and gas production into the separator followed by very high liquid and gas rates when the liquid slug is being produced. Slug flow behavior has detrimental effects due to large pressure and flow rate fluctuations it produces. The large liquid production is controlled by slug control valves installed near the crude pipelines outlet. The valves are partially closed on a fixed position to prevent the possible overflow and subsequent shut down of the separator. The large pipeline pressure drop and pressure fluctuations can sometimes reduce the wells production capacity.A range of solutions have been considered to reduce the high wellhead back pressures. And only the gas injection method is evaluated here.The objectives of this study are, as follows:To determine whether gas injection can reduce pressure losses in slugging crude pipelinesTo evaluate effects of gas injection into crude pipelines under severe slug flow.Pipeline Gas Injection Technology ReviewNo studies could be found presenting pressure drop reduction by gas injection in hilly terrain pipelines transporting crude (oil, gas and water) under severe slug flow regime in the literature.

AB  - ABSTRACTHeavy slugging was observed in a well-pipeline-riser system connected to the Statoil operated Åsgard A production ship offshore Norway. Large variations in pressure, temperature and rates both in the well, the pipeline and in the topside processing facilities caused several problems. Downhole pressure variations concerned the reservoir engineers while temperature variations in the pipeline gave concerns related to hydrate formation. An effective project organisation was formed to find a solution promptly. Control engineers, reservoir engineers, process engineers as well as control room operators had to work effectively together, and difficulties between land and offshore based organisations must be overcome. The concept of Integrated Operations forms a basis for streamlining work processes across disciplines both onshore and offshore. The slug control project presented was conducted according to the philosophy of Integrated Operations. This was possible by utilizing the real-time Onshore Support Centre for the Halten Nordland area. Costs were saved by avoiding offshore trips for land based personnel, and creative solutions to unforeseen problems were formed.The technical solution to the problem is presented. The heavy slugging was effectively removed by an automatic slug control system based on feedback from the well pressure. The implemented solution opens up for increased production and recovery, since it is possible to produce close to actual constraints, for example bubble point pressure, max sand free rate and hydrate temperature.

AB  - Abstract In this work, to the knowledge of the authors, it is the first time that an analytical solution demonstrates how the pressure profile changes with frequency and when this change takes place. Case studies are also presented to analyze the impact of different pressure profiles on well deliverability. Reservoir pressure profiles associated with steady-state, pseudosteady-state, and transient flow for a constant pressure drawdown were derived decades ago. These profiles, however, may not be applicable near the end-life of a well due to the unstable nature of fluid flow in the wellbore (e.g., liquid loading, slugging), and could explain why certain wells stop flowing before predicted. This paper shows how the flow instability changes the reservoir pressure profile and what consequences that change might bring to well production. Previous publications have shown numerical and experimental evidences that not only the pressure profile in the reservoir changes when there is an increase in the frequency of oscillation in the bottomhole pressure, but also that understanding this phenomenon is fundamental to reliably predict the time-dependent deliverability of wells.

Introduction Flow assurance is an engineering analysis process to assure hydrocarbon fluids are transmitted economically from the reservoir to the end user over the life of a project in any environment. The term "Flow Assurance" was first used by Petrobras in the early 1990s, it originally only covered the thermal hydraulics and production chemistry issues encountered during oil and gas production. While the term is relatively new, the problems related with flow assurance have been a critical issue in the oil/gas industry from very early days. Hydrates were observed causing blockages in gas pipelines as early as the 1930s. Another problem is slugging and liquid handling. The occurrence of slug flow in a transportation pipeline and a gathering system can cause many problems in design and operation processes, which include kinetic force on fittings and vessels, pressure cycling, control instability and inadequate phase separation. Slugging affects greatly the design of receiving facilities. In gas condensate systems, larger lines result in more liquid being retained in the pipeline at low rates. When the flow rate is increased, much of the liquid can be swept out, potentially overwhelming the liquid handling capability of the receiving facilities. The facilities can be flooded and damaged if the slugs larger than the slug catcher capacity. Therefore, quantifying the slug size, frequency and velocity is necessary prior to equipment design.

AB  - Abstract Flow assurance is an engineering process provides comprehensive analysis to assure hydrocarbon fluids are transported through pipelines (small lines or trunk lines) in an economical and safe manner from the producing wells to the treatment plant. Thus, flow assurance covers the whole range of possible flow problems that can trigger in pipelines such as hydrate formation, erosion, and severe slugging or back pressure to the old producing wells if they are connected to the same network. This paper introduces a case study done on a new gas field named "Denise-B?? located in the Mediterranean Sea, Egypt.This field is planned to be on production after finishing drilling and completion phases of three wells (Denise-4, Denise-5 and Denise-S4). The main scope is to optimize the whole network to select the best development rates of the new field without any back out from the old producing ones. At the same time, overcoming any flow problems like hydrate formation since offshore wells and offshore transmission lines may be operating under conditions where hydrate formation is favorable. The paper highlights that the change of inhibitor from di-ethylene to mono-ethylene glycol has a significant impact on the required injection rates. It is found that using mono-ethylene glycol compared to di-ethylene glycol can save up to 45% of the required volume rate to lower the hydrate temperature with 5 0C margin with flowing gas temperature. This is also is linked to properly design the injection pump capacity. Hence; it enhances the confidence and supports the decision to use mono glycol as hydrate inhibitor at low injection rates in offshore gathering networks while reducing the operating costs. Introduction Some of the most severe production-operation hazards are risks associated with the transportation of fluids. When condensate, water, and gas simultaneously flow in a well or pipeline, a number of potential problems can arise. These problems can be related to flow instability, erosion, and solids formation (like hydrates) and can lead to serious risk of leakages or blockages. The pipeline simulation tools can be used to simulate the steady state of the gathering network that collects the production of fluids from different gas or oil fields. Thus; it can provide a quick but efficient view of the system highlighting its criticalities that require more attention from operational point of view.

AB  - Abstract As a common occurrence in production operations, liquid-rich horizontal gas (and gassy oil) wells in unconventional plays develop severe instabilities at different stages of their well life. In this novel work, we first quantify the three-phase gas-oil-water multiphase flow behavior leading up to the characteristic severe loading signatures in order to better understand the dynamic heel-dominant liquids loading. Then, we demonstrate how a simple analytical diameter-and-inclination-dependent critical gas velocity equation can be used to determine the onset of the severe loading instabilities in a variety of artificial lift/liquid loading mitigation strategies, namely end-of-tubing landing (EOT), tubing/casing sizing, gas lift variations and tail pipe/dip tube. Actual high frequency bottom hole pressure data along with measured surface conditions will be used to evaluate the slugging behavior and recreate using analytical multiphase flow simulator. The flow conditions will be extrapolated to the heel/near lateral section of the well and simulated for various lift strategies.

AB  - Abstract Flow assurance problems related to flow slugging, hydrates, and wax gelling lead to this study, post two integrated oil pipelines clogged in the Caspian Sea during the winter season. The methods and proposed solutions will be further deliberate, which includes the development of operating envelope to ease implementation. The overall methodology is based on dynamic flow assurance simulation and mathematical analysis, which was adapted depending on the problem being studied. Reduced production and terrain undulations had caused severe slugging in both pipelines which are flowing multiphase fluids. The bifurcation analysis of slug control valve will be discussed to determine the best choke opening that can eliminate slugging. The flow slugging also caused hydrate risk that was made worst during shutdown. Few strategies of hydrate mitigation including implementing extra heat insulation at riser air gap, gas flaring, optimised and overdose injection of mono ethylene glycol (MEG) were considered. Hydrate mass was evaluated for all the mitigations and requirement to inject lean MEG immediately after shutdown or prior start-up was identified. In terms of wax management, lower Flowing Tubing Head Temperature (FTHT) from wells added a challenge with limited facilities capability to operate more than the wax appearance temperature (WAT). Operating envelope of crude oil heater under heating limitation will be clearly shown to avoid operating in wax region. The development of operating envelope had enabled Operations personnel to know the safe condition to operate both pipelines during critical scenarios. The approach has changed the way the company operates, to ensure production is protected and maintained with minimal disruption caused by slugging, hydrate and wax gelling events.

AB  - ABSTRACTThe severe slugging flow instability in flowline-riser systems is an upstream compressibility problem, where trapped gas upstream the riser base can be compressed and eventually cause blow out of the accumulated liquid in the riser. For the case of a very long riser, flow instabilities can be induced by gas expansion in the riser itself. Even small amounts of trapped gas can cause flow instabilities, as the accumulated gas is flushed through the bend at the riser base and into the riser. Small scale air-water experiments have been carried out to illustrate this phenomenon in an 8m long vertical riser with an internal diameter of 16mm. Constant inlet pressure is obtained by an overflow arrangement for the liquid. The gas is injected in a small undulation upstream the riser base. Unstable production has been observed both for continuous and non-continuous liquid production at the outlet, and the experiments have successfully been simulated by a Lagrangian slug tracking code.

AB  - ABSTRACTWe have carried out laboratory experiments for the phase split of a gas-liquid flow from a single flowline to a dual riser. The facility used for the experiments is the air-water loop at the Shell Technology Centre in Amsterdam. The 2” diameter loop consists of a 100 m long flowline followed by a dual 15 m high vertical section. The two risers are connected to the same separator at a platform that is operated at atmospheric pressure. The set-up includes a non-symmetric side-branch T-splitter, of which both the side arm and the run arm result in a vertical riser (Riser 1 and Riser 2, respectively). All experiments were conducted with slug flow conditions in the incoming flowline. It has been observed in the experiments that the liquid phase preferentially flows into Riser 2, while the gas phase is predominantly diverted through Riser 1. However, due to the vertical orientation of the risers, this maldistribution can result in gravity dominated flow in Riser 2. As a result, quasi-stable modes form in the dual riser system. These can imply extreme situations, like a fully liquid-filled Riser 2 or partial separation of the phases over the two risers. Each mode has a typical riser base pressure. It was observed that manual choking can influence the phase split (albeit to a limited extent), and is capable of switching the system between the quasi-stable modes. For specific combinations of valve openings and flow rates, Riser 2 experiences a severe slugging cycle. As a result, the phase split shows strong transient behaviour, either with constant cycle times or with an irregular time dependence. Also here manual choking can influence the characteristics of the cycle and is capable of completely suppressing it.

AB  - AbstractSubsea operations represent a critical component in the production value chain of most Gulf of Mexico Deepwater assets. These operations provide many unique challenges, including flow assurance of the production streams. Complexity in production fluid chemistry, avoidance and management of problematic production conditions (slugging, gas lift control, hydrates, wax, asphaltenes, etc), and management of the overall subsea facilities for optimum production are all parts of the subsea flow assurance area. The main objective of this paper is to describe the work that was performed during a pilot test of a real time based flow assurance tool built for operations support. The tool consisted of a real time information system kernel coupled with anoffline model for 'what-if' scenarios and automatic lookahead functions. The simulator supports operations through intelligent alerts to operators and technical subsea experts. The tool entitled, 'Advanced Warning System (AWS),' was built and tested on-line for several weeks at one of Na Kika's oil loops.IntroductionSubsea operations represent a critical component in the production value chain of most Gulf of Mexico Deepwater assets. Flow assurance of the production streams constitutes one of the many unique challenges these assets face. Avoidance and management of problematic production conditions such as slugging, gas lift control and hydrates are flow assurance issues that deserve special attention.With this motivation, a BP Gulf of Mexico Deepwater project team initiated a pilot project to implement an online tool coupled with alarm systems and independent analytical tools to run non-specific scenarios. The Na Kika North Oil Loop was chosen for this implementation due to its unique configuration, complexity and level of instrumentation.Field DescriptionThe Na kika base development consists of five oil and gas fields in the Mississippi Canyon area of the Gulf of Mexico tied-back to a central floating oil and gas processing facility. The water depths for each of the fields range from 5,800 ft to 7,000 ft and are offset between 6 to 13 miles from the facility.The individual fields are named Ariel, Kepler, Fourier, Herschel, and east Anstey. Additionally, the fields aredeveloped utilizing three unique gathering flow loops with their produced fluids routed back to the floating production facility.The Ariel and Kepler oil fields were developed with a 10' x 16' pipe-in-pipe (PIP), 25-mile flowloop to the northwest of the production facility. These fields include five subsea oil wells (i.e. Ariel: A1, A2 and A3 and Kepler: K1 and K2); each one of them daisy-chained within the northern loop route. The north loop is unique as the flowline route is generally downhill towards the host. The water depths along the route range from approximately 5,800 ft (shallowest) at the well locations to 6,340 ft at the host. This oil loop was selected for the pilot.

AB  - Abstract In this paper we present an automated surveillance and optimization system for gas lifted wells. The system integrates flow instability diagnostics, steady-state flow models, and transient multiphase flow models to provide engineers and operators with a complete solution for well flow surveillance and optimization. This system is a significant enhancement to the Gas Lift Optimization Workflow (GLOW™) that was developed and deployed to multiple assets including a platform in the Gulf of Mexico. The system calibrates the models to match flowrates and pressures from multiple well tests. The calibrated models are then used to produce operational maps that provide accurate and robust flow instability recovery recommendations and stability constraints for optimization routines. We will show an example implementation of the system for a gas lifted well from an offshore platform. In most cases, the calibrated transient flow models accurately replicated the amplitude and frequency of pressure and flowrate oscillations for two types of flow instability: casing heading and hydrodynamic slugging. We also compare transient flow and steady-state models, and discuss the use of both to maximize computing efficiency. The developed system uses multiphase flow transient models, in an automated way, to produce operational maps that can aid either asset staff or the GLOW™ system to optimize production while steering away from unstable flow. In summary, the system provides a comprehensive, robust, and integrated set of tools for the surveillance and optimization needs of asset staff.

AB  - Abstract Some cases of marine operations with pipes conveying multiphase flows can show structural movements depending on the internal flow dynamics. A floating pipe conveying two-phase gas-liquid flow is an example where a two-way coupling between the internal flow and the structural dynamics is needed. The objectives of the paper is to demonstrate a method for dynamic coupling of slug flow and pipe structure simulations by comparing numerical results with small scale experiments on flexible pipes. Two small scale experimental setups for two-phase slug flow in floating and submerged flexible pipes were prepared. The experiments were designed to give unstable flows. The air and water flow rates were measured and the pipe movements were video recorded. A new coupled model was established, in which a structural dynamic model has been implemented into a dynamic slug tracking model. Forces due to the internal flow such as fluid weight, friction and centrifugal force were included in the structural model, as well as external fluid drag and soil contact forces among others. The implemented model can reproduce fairly well the dynamic forces due to the internal flow as well as predict the associated pipe deformations and movements. Slug flow can potentially have an impact on pipe dynamics, in particular for cases where severe slugging can occur.

AB  - AbstractIt is sure that production equipment has to handle solids, which are released from the reservoir rock during hydrocarbon extraction. Subsequently it is necessary to define all operational consequences and circumstances at an early project stage. But solids released during well intervention operations or disposal of any kind of fluid through the flowlines strictly have to be avoided or taken care of by special actions. This is especially true when rotating equipment such as twin-screw multiphase pumps are part of the downstream production train.Operation parameters mostly influencing the wear, such as axial fluid velocities and product viscosity are outlined. The wear pattern due to erosion as well as abrasion occurring in Multiphase Pumps with its effect on boosting operations is described. Increasing suction pressure and pump temperature definitely are a sign for a decreasing capacity of the pump so that production forecast can not be met any longer. Excessive leakage from the mechanical seals are another one.Preventive measures are to be taken in case of solids transport anticipated. Material selection, but moreover surface treatment of the effected pump internals offer a variety of chances to reduce the wear. But neither can such wear be excluded nor avoided as it is the same for any other equipment used in such environment.Special attention is given to the mechanical seals, whose wear sometimes can stop operations immediately. Different material selections for this equipment seldom offers improvement, and may even lead to a worse situation. Equipment used to filter the fluid stream can be used. It is necessary to design them for multiphase flow with sometimes severe slugging to occur. Strainers (at least temporary) are a must after any work on the flowlines to the pump.Examples from field installations will finalise this paper outlining the experience gained under a variety of operating parameters, surface treatments, mechanical seal arrangements, and filtering equipmentIntroductionMultiphase boosting or pumping has widely been accepted as an alternative to traditional production scenarios. More than 90% of the pumps used in this service are of the positive displacement type, and again about 75 % of these are twin-screw pumps. This pump type already plays a major role whenever heavy crude oil has to be moved. From this point of view it is only naturally that operators of Venezuelan heavy crude oil can be seen at the forefront of users of multiphase boosting. Whenever hydrocarbons are extracted from the reservoir, they mostly are accompanied by (sand) particles, although no efforts are spared to leave them behind. Once in the well bore flow, those particles make their way, and there are limited reasonable possibilities to eliminate their unpleasant characteristics. This paper looks after the practical side of multiphase boosting applications for twin-screw pumps and does not want to compete in any way with elaborates made by specialists of various disciplines. Aspects in front of, in, and behind the pump will be dealt with, with no guarantee to cover all of them.

AB  - ABSTRACTFlow assurance is an engineering process provides comprehensive analysis to assure hydrocarbon fluids are transported through pipelines (small lines or trunk lines) in an economical and safe manner from the producing wells to the treatment plant. Thus, flow assurance covers the whole range of possible flow problems that can trigger in pipelines such as hydrate formation, erosion, and severe slugging or back pressure to the old producing wells if they are connected to the same network. This paper introduces a case study done on a new gas field named “Denise-B” located in the Mediterranean Sea, Egypt. This field is planned to be on production after finishing drilling and completion phases of three wells (Denise-4, Denise-5 and Denise-S4). The main scope is to optimize the whole network to select the best development rates of the new field without any back out from the old producing ones. At the same time, overcoming any flow problems like hydrate formation since offshore wells and offshore transmission lines may be operating under conditions where hydrate formation is favorable. It is found that using mono-ethylene glycol compared to di-ethylene glycol can save up to 45% of the required rate to lower the hydrate temperature with 5 °C margin with flowing gas temperature.

AB  - Technology Focus Since I began writing this feature 2 years ago, I have purposely avoided discussing the elephant in the room, but it seems that now the time is right to give the topic its due. Just as the unconventional revolution has transformed our industry during the past decade, it has also dominated the world of artificial lift. In fact, it can be difficult to find an artificial lift paper or presentation these days that does not address, in some way, the design and operation of artificial lift systems in unconventional shale oil wells. Challenges abound for operators attempting to deploy artificial lift systems in unconventional applications. As always, operators set a variety of challenging business and operational goals for themselves: minimize capital and operational expenditures; maximize drawdown over the well’s life; and minimize downtime, failure frequency, and intervention frequency. The unique nature of these wells can make it challenging to achieve many of these goals, let alone all of them. Because the wells are drilled directionally (and often in a hurry), the wellbore may feature small-diameter casing, high dogleg severity, and high tortuosity. The production profile of these wells can vary dramatically over a short period of time—wells initially producing over 10,000 STB/D can produce as little as 50 STB/D just a few years later. Further complicating matters, unconventional wells often produce fluids with high gas/liquid ratios and require pumps to be set above the producing interval, making gas handling a challenge. To make matters worse, the wells typically pro-duce solids early on, and they may suffer from a variety of flow-assurance issues, including asphaltenes, paraffin deposition, hydrates, and severe slugging. All of these can make it extremely challenging—if not impossible—to achieve reliable operation with downhole pumping systems. For this reason, something surprising has happened: Gas lift has emerged as the lift method of choice in new onshore completions in these basins. While gas lift may be the “easy button,” it is not without its share of challenges. In many areas, there is a lack of adequate supply gas or compression equipment. Hydrates are common in the winter months. Limited injection pressure combined with a rapidly varying production profile can lead to frequent, costly interventions. Because the gas lift method is new to these producing basins, there is often a lack of local expertise needed to support such systems. Although gas lift may be relatively immune to the previously mentioned operational challenges, it generally provides less drawdown than what might be achieved with an optimally sized pumping system. If I sound overly pessimistic about the prospects for artificial lift in unconventional wells, I’m actually not. Engineers thrive when they have challenging problems to solve, and unconventional resources provide artificial lift engineers with ample opportunities for innovation. In recent years, I have witnessed a windfall of new technologies, including improved electrical-submersible-pump stage design, the use of permanent magnet motors, improved downhole gas-separation techniques, tailpipe systems for slug management, a variety of new automation techniques, surface-controlled gas lift valves, modular high-pressure compression systems, novel downhole completion designs, and more. I am thrilled with the array of new artificial lift technologies that the unconventional revolution has prompted, and I can’t wait to see what the future holds.

AB  - Abstract Severe slugging occurs in different parts of the total production system. Slug flow is a major, expensive headache for oil producers and it has a negative impact on the operation of onshore and offshore facilities. It causes reduction on separator efficiency and unnecessary shutdowns. The study presented in this paper covers the total process to analyze slug flow pattern in a network and possible ways of mitigation. The oil and gas distribution networks are complex and each present distinct but sometimes overlapping flow assurance challenges that will change over time. In this paper developed a workflow that simulate slug flow. The novelty of this workflow is the ability to perform a slugging analysis with different scenarios that mitigate slug flow. The fluctuations frequently lead to a reduction of separator efficiency caused by excessive liquid levels and pressure surges in the first stage separator. This solution, can provide a relative low-cost method to mitigate slugging and can help the operator to anticipate further decisions based on forecast production, although each system needs to be examined in detail to understand the current operation and the future performance changing the production conditions.

AB  - Ageing offshore oilfields with increasing water cuts can suffer from severe slugging and liquid hold-up in subsea flowlines. Excessive liquid loading in flowline and riser sections results in unstable processing condition on the topside; potentially leading to off-spec crude oil and produced water and in extreme cases to production deferment due to level alarm and trips in production separators. Recently, a novel black oil foamer (BOF) application in the GOM was able to mitigate slugging in a deepwater subsea tieback. The oil based foamer is designed to transition the flow regime from slugging to dispersed flow, allowing gas to sweep liquid to the surface. This paper will describe how steady state multiphase modeling was used to verify if foamer application can result in a reduction of liquid hold up and, hence, production improvement. Additionally, the modeling results will be compared to the recent field trial. Multiphase flow modeling has been performed for fluids of 23-37 API with a GOR of 400-4,000 scf/bbl with a flowline water cut between 16% and 50%. The fluid data were incorporated in the model with the pipeline geometry and topography, or suitable approximations when data was unavailable. The simulation results provided insight into the flow regime for various production scenarios, and thus, suitability of the oil based foamer technology. The simulation results showed that the riser switches between slug flow and bubble flow regimes. The mechanism of oil based foamer technology for slugging elimination is a transition from slug flow to annular dispersed flow. Fluid flow models shows good match with slugging seen in field without foamer. Additionally, fluid property was adjusted to incorporate foamer effect on lowered liquid density. This case mimics application of oil based foamer and results in no slugging regime for GOM case, hence improved production rate. This novel use of multiphase modeling for foamer applications will allow to more accurately identify opportunities for oil based foamer applications, and eventually be able to predict the effect of foamer on system slugging and production enhancement.

AB  - Abstract Steam piping and pipeline whipping, bowing, buckling and jumping are some of the phenomenon observed in the field due to improper design and inadequate commissioning procedures. As a result, ‘steam flood', ‘cyclic steam stimulation' and ‘SAGD' operations experiences long steaming hold??ups, extended shutdowns, production losses and environmental clean??up Steam pipelines up to 32?? diameter and 30 km length, with 11 ?? 15 MPa design pressure and 250??340 deg C design temperature for quality of steam from 80 to 100%, are being designed with high strength material and thin wall designs. Although, designs are robust and utilizes proven stress analysis tools, but are often fail to address the common field issues of unequal warming, condensate buildup and severe slugging encountered during the commissioning and at the start of the new steaming cycle. Also, piping connections lack the provision to accommodate requisite thermal growth and/or the unequal thermal growth between steam piping, production piping, well heads, batteries headers, leading to severe steam leaks. Steam pipeline and piping are designed with anchors and guides to deal with thermal growth in the horizontal plane. When steam is charged at the ambient temperature, the cooling of the steam in long length pipelines and resulting condensate build up cause thermal gradient in the pipe wall. This thermal gradient coupled with transition in the piping and pipeline elevations are mainly responsible for the bowing, jumping and whipping phenomenon. Pressure, temperature and strain gauge instrumentation should be installed at strategic location to closely monitor and execute uniform warming up to avoid whipping, bowing, buckling and jumping of steam piping and pipelines. Every incident of whipping, bowing, buckling and jumping of steam piping & pipelines requires detailed integrity evaluation of the affected sections, prior to putting back into operation. Detailed assessment of wall thinning, ovality, dents and other mechanical damages are mandatory to comply with thin wall designs. The result in most incidents is complete replacement of the affected sections, requiring prolonged and costly shutdowns and risk to the producing reservoir due to lack of pressure.

AB  - The objective of this work is to present a new IPR model for transient well simulations that gives precise results without the high computational costs of the reservoir finite difference simulation. The limitations of using conventional IPR models for transient well simulations, specifically for oscillatory wells experiencing severe slugging or casing heading phenomena, are evidenced. The flow rate calculated with the IPR might significantly differ from the results obtained with the reservoir finite differences model for periodic bottom-hole pressures. Analytical solutions of a radial homogeneous reservoir were developed (both in time and Laplace domain) and they were used to generate its frequency response. A low order transfer function that approximated this frequency response was generated, which was named “Dynamic IPR”. Adequate boundary conditions are essential to obtain a precise result for transient well simulations. The conventional IPR models are frequently employed as the bottom-hole boundary conditions to represent the reservoir response even in transient simulations. Another possibility is to couple the reservoir finite difference model with the well and solve them simultaneously, when the IPR transient response is known to be inaccurate. A new alternative approach, the Dynamic IPR, is presented as a low order system of ordinary differential equations that can be applied for oscillatory wells and supposedly for any transient simulation without complex reservoir behavior such as coning for example. The Dynamic IPR was compared with the two analytical solutions (the deconvolution of the Laplace domain solution was performed with the Iseger algorithm) and the conventional IPR. A sinusoidal bottom-hole flowing pressure was assumed and the corresponding liquid flow rates were calculated. The liquid flow rates determined from the transfer function were almost identical to the exact results and the computational costs incredibly lower than performing finite differences in cases in which the conventional IPR presented poor results. This work emphasizes that there are some situations for which the IPR are inadequate and presents simple procedures to determine when that is the case. Most importantly, the proposed Dynamic IPR can be easily included in any transient simulation and greatly improve the results.

AB  - AbstractThe composition tracking approach allows an improved estimation of the local fluid properties. It enables computation of the local thermodynamic equilibrium. An optimized two component representation of the fluid is shown to be sufficient in a number of applications. This paper illustrates possible applications of the composition tracking approach as applied to production allocation problems. In this case more than two components are used to describe the two-phase flow mixture. IntroductionThe TACITE code developed by I.F.P., ELF and TOTAL is a compositional transient multiphase flow simulation tool, for the design and control of oil and gas production pipelines and wells. One of the main objectives of this code is to predict accurately the propagation of liquid slugs. These slugs may occur during transient flow due to boundary conditions modification such as inlet flowrates variation, outlet depressurisation, shutdown or restart. They may also appear due to transients created by heavy topography changes: terrain slugging or severe slugging phenomena.In the first version of TACITE and in other transient simulation codes for multiphase flow in pipelines such as OLGA. PLAC the fluid properties and thermodynamic equilibrium are based on a fixed inlet global composition.This papers presents the TACITE composition tracking feature. This approach allows a local determination of the fluid composition, hence it provides a better estimate of the fluid properties and local equilibrium conditions, possibly leading to the formation of hydrates, and/or wax deposition.The main advantages of this approach are as follows:Variations of sources composition versus time can be taken into account. For network simulations, it accounts for the varying compositions in the different links. The code provides the liquid and gas compositions at the outlet of the pipe, which can be useful for allocation purposes or downstream plant operation. The use of an internal flash algorithm ensures robustness and accuracy of the simulation, in particular for conditions lying in the vicinity of the phase envelope (bubble or dew lines). Phenomena such as local accumulation of the heavy components in the low points of the line and subsequent changes in the fluid properties can be predicted through this compositional approach. For coupled simulations between the reservoir and flowline, or between the flowline and process facilities, the compositional tracking approach makes better use of the information already available when the other code operates in compositional mode. The first commercial version of TACITE computes a lumped composition with two pseudo-components. The algorithm uses compositional lumping as a pre-processor to optimize the characterisation of the pseudo-components. The version under development of TACITE can take more than 2 components into account.In the first part of this paper we describe the lumping method. Then we present the mathematical model: transport equations for mass, momentum and energy, closure laws (hydrodynamic and thermodynamic models), and the treatment of initial and boundary conditions. Next, the main resolution algorithms are presented. Finally, the numerical scheme that has been chosen is presented briefly.

AB  - ABSTRACTSevere slugging is reported from some field operations, when an increase in the production rate leads to a transition from steady stratified flow to slug flow in the pipeline. The slugs can be longer than anticipated for normal hydrodynamic slugging and the flow transients can then be a limitation for the production capacity of the system.>Long initial slugs at the transition to slug flow has been demonstrated in air-water laboratory experiments earlier, where a delay in the stratified-slug transition causes excess liquid buildup in the stratified layer, which blows out as a long plug at the time of slug initiation. >New experiments have been made in order to investigate this flow phenomenon at high pressures. The slug initiation at low pressure has also been studied with a slug tracking code, allowing numerical experimentation to be carried out.>The flow experiments were conducted at the SINTEF Multiphase Flow Laboratory (69 mm inner diameter, 100 m long, inclination -0.10, gas densities 1, 19, and 46 kg/m3). Liquid height was measured with gamma densitometers at four axial locations. Two different inlet flow conditions were applied to the test section (slug flow or stratified flow) in order to promote early or delayed flow regime transitions. Transient experiments were made, in which the gas flow rate was kept constant, and the liquid flow rate carefully increased across the flow regime transition.>In the low pressure experiments, the first observed slugs at the point of transition could become very long, but the subsequent slugging after the initial slugs was less severe. Long initial slugs were not observed in the high pressure experiments. The phenomenon can be reproduced by a slug tracking model, provided an appropriate slug initiation model is applied.

AB  - Abstract Artificial Lift Case Study: A Mississippian Lime well was tested on an electrical submersible pump (ESP) after previous installations were unsatisfactory. The three main objectives of the test were: (1) to determine if the run life and production of an ESP system could be increased on a gas-slugging well; (2) to implement a downhole recirculation system inside an artificial sump; and (3) to monitor the economic impact of the installation of the ESP unit to the well. The challenges for the ESP system for this specific test included: (i) low liquid inflow during severe gas slugging; (ii) high gas/liquid ratio (>800 SCF/BBL); (iii) difficult startup conditions; (iv) thermal and mechanical damage to motor lead extensions. Due to these challenges, using traditional gas-separation and gas-handling technology was considered a disadvantage. A downhole recirculation system inside an artificial sump was used as an alternative method to prevent potential gas locking, to circulate fluid to keep the motor cool, and to enhance reservoir drawdown. This paper presents basic principles of the application of ESP systems in a gassy and gas-slugging well, principles of implementing a downhole recirculation system, and uncommon techniques to effectively operate an ESP unit in gas-slugging wells. Historical design challenges system-specific design/operation, and production results of the tested well are also presented. Introduction The Mississippian Lime was a conventional play that is being revitalized with horizontal drilling technology. The application of unconventional technology enables operators to access oil and gas reserves that were previously uneconomical to produce through vertical wells. The Mississippian Lime has produced for more than 50 years from mostly traditional, vertical wells. According to the Kansas Independent Oil and Gas Association, more than 4,000 vertical wells have been drilled in the Mississippian Lime. While vertical wells have proven to be unreliable and marginal producers in the play, the fact that the formation is relatively shallow, can be drilled horizontally1, and can benefit from hydraulic fracturing has given this play new potential. Gas-handling capacity is likely the most complex and challenging issue in artificial lift. Production in these wells varies significantly due to the evolution of the reservoir. A typical scenario is an operation starting with high liquid rates while handling some gas. Over a period of a few months production rates fall and gas production rises, making reliable and steady operation a struggle.

AB  - SummarySlug flow is a flow pattern commonly encountered in offshore multiphase flowlines. It is characterized by an alternate flow of liquid slugs and gas pockets, resulting in an unsteady hydrodynamic behavior. All important design variables, such as slug length ad slug frequency, liquid holdup, and pressure drop, vary with time and this makes the prediction of slug flow characteristics both difficult and challenging. This paper reviews the state of the art methods in slug-character sizing and slug-volume predictions. In addition, history matching of measured slug flow data is performed using the OLGA transient simulator.This paper reviews the design factors that impact slug-tracking option under a process-control system. The slug-tracking option of the simulator is applied to predict the slug length and the slug volume during a field operation. This paper will also comment on the performance of common empirical slug-prediction correlations.IntroductionThere is an increasing need to develop more oil and gas design and development of economical offshore production fields in harsh offshore environments. The special problems associated with offshore operations pose new challenges in the systems. In an offshore environment, the transient effects during startup and shutdown of the production system become more pronounced. New transient simulation tools, such as OLGA and PLAC, are being used more in the design and modeling of these transient effects.Slug flow is one of the most common flow patterns. It is characterized by an unsteady, alternating flow of liquid slugs and gas pockets. Because of its highly complex nature, the prediction of slug length, slug frequency, and pressure drop by theoretical means is almost impossible. Because of its importance to oil and gas production operations, many studies have been carried out and empirical and mechanistic models have been developed. "Steady-state" slug flow can be classified as either hydrodynamic or terrain-induced slugging. "Transient" slugging can also occur in pipelines as a result of changing operating conditions, pigging, or during startup operations. Empirical correlations based on field or laboratory data have been developed to predict the transition to slug flow, the slug velocity, the slug length, the slug frequency, and the statistical distribution of slug lengths.Hydrodynamic slugging is the normal slugging pattern encountered in flowlines. Most of the empirical methods developed for predicting the transition to slug flow were developed for horizontal or near-horizontal pipes. The most often used slug-length prediction methods in the industry for large pipe diameter are the Brill1 correlation and its revisions, such as the Norris2 correlation and the Scott et al.3 correlation. Terrain-induced slugging is induced by low points in the flowline that may shrink or grow after the dip. It is more dynamic and less understood compared with hydrodyanmic slugging. Every flowline through hilly terrain has its own elevation profile, and therefore, has its own slugging characteristics. The worst kind of terrain-induced slugging is severe slugging, caused by an abrupt change from the horizontal to vertical flow directions. Severe slugging is frequently seen in risers. This usually occurs when both gas and liquid flow rates are relatively low.

AB  - Abstract For many years, the pipeline industry has worked on leak detection technologies to accurately predict and mitigate the occurrence of leaks in pipelines. However, this is not an easy task since many systems have different characteristics and the existing technologies have specific ranges of applications. Nevertheless, the technological progress has reduced the gap between accurate leak predictions and false alarms in single-phase systems. A new challenge has been growing leak detection technologies with multiphase production systems since many of the current leak detection techniques limit their applications to single-phase systems. Although, there are some technologies that claim multiphase capabilities; it is not clear yet how they overcome the challenges imposed by the hydrodynamics of a multiphase system. Therefore, the main objective of this paper is to assess a multiphase system and simulate leak events to gain a better understating of its hydrodynamic behavior during the transient leak event. The studied multiphase system operates with three phases: oil, water, and gas; thus, flow patterns vary from stratified to severe slugging for some operating conditions and locations. The 30-in. pipeline system starts from an offshore production-separation platform which is located approximately 55 miles offshore and delivers its production to a separation processing plant on-shore. A leak condition was simulated in the middle of the trunkline to determine its effect on the hydrodynamics of the system and both ends facilities. Different gas oil ratios (GOR) and pipeline pressures were evaluated to determine the effect of those conditions on the leak detectability. One key parameter to accurate determination of a leak is to precisely differentiate or filter a leak signal (pressure, flow rate, pressure wave, etc.) from normal pipeline data noise. In this case that was even more challenging since a slugging condition was observed in the normal operation of the multiphase system which generates flow and pressure fluctuations that could overlap the leak data. This paper presents the results obtained for the steady-state prior leakage and transient leakage cases. In addition, a sensitivity analysis of different gas oil ratios is presented as well to map out its effect on the leak detectability. Introduction and Background A concern for operating a multiphase production system under higher pressures and gas-oil-ratios was expressed during a capacity increase study since that would reduce its reliability and integrity while increasing the operational risk. The offshore field demonstrated a potential for producing 5-7% more crude oil and gas than that of its original design capacity and the capacity study indicated a good feasibility of operating at those conditions. Therefore, a risk assessment of the system was required to ensure it function within safety compliance and quantify the risk associated with these new operating conditions. In addition, a part of the IMP possible mechanical failures (leaks) and their effect has to be evaluated to determine the consequence of a leak and how to better control it. Consequently, a leak simulation analysis was conducted to understand how the system will behave under leak conditions, to estimate the time to possibly detect a leak with the current technology, and to get an approximation of the amount of product spill for mitigation actions.

AB  - Abstract The Banzala Field (Block 0, Angola) has produced oil with horizontal wells and ESP's as the artificial lift method for more than seven years. These wells were drilled with large sinusoidal undulations intentionally to cut the pay section a number of times. Banzala "A?? horizontal wells underperformed expected production, possibly due to downhole slugging. In addition, declining reservoir pressures, rising GOR, and rising water-cut have also adversely affected production. The objective of this simulation study of wellbore transient flow is to understand past production performance and to find ways to mitigate adverse well behavior.  Simulation showed that low ESP efficiency could be related to down-hole slugging. GOR was the most significant factor for slugging and increasing water cut made slugging worse. The sinusoidal wellbore trajectory was studied to optimize ESP operating conditions. It was found that reducing sinusoidal amplitude by half and flattening the heel-end entrance angle from 79 deg. to 86 deg. would suppress slugging significantly. Background Banzala Field. The Banzala "A?? Jacket includes thirteen wells producing from the Mesa and Lago reservoirs. These wells were drilled with large sinusoidal undulations intentionally to cut the pay section multiple times. BZ-A10 is a sinusoidal well in the Lago reservoir, see Fig. 1 excerpted from the reservoir simulation model. Since BZ-A10 is located close to the water injector BZ-A14, it had a higher water cut than other production wells. It also has a high-amplitude sinusoidal shape. BZ-A10 had an abrupt production drop accompanying increasing water production. Therefore, BZ-A10 was selected for a more-detailed study. No PLT logs have been run yet to measure downhole flow distribution and characteristics; however, it is possible that poor well deliverability was caused by water accumulating in wellbore low spots and gas in higher points. This would not only have choked the flow but also caused worse slugging and unstable production. The use of ESP's could further complicate matters. Low ESP efficiency may relate to the gas-handling ability of the specific equipment used and the actual GOR. Wellbore transient flow simulation was carried out to understand what was going on during the historical production period and to find mitigating solutions.  Dynamic modeling was required to capture possible slugging.  Horizontal wells1, especially sinusoidal ones6, may generate severe slugging which is not predicted by conventional NODAL analysis. If the wellbore geometry, flow velocity, GOR and WC fall into certain operating ranges, severe slugging may occur during which liquid accumulates in the low spots in one period and flushes into the ESP in another period. Banzala A-10 Production Performance. Fig. 2 gives liquid flow rate QL, GOR, and WC history. Liquid rate is based on well test data. Note that the allocated production rate was about 20% lower than the well test rate. Analysis indicated that the well-test rate was more reliable and thus it was used. Fig. 3 shows ESP downhole sensor measurement data (SCADA) for the BZ-A10 well. The entire production history from Feb. 2000 to Feb. 2006 can be divided into three different stages, as shown in Fig. 2 and Fig. 3.

AB  - This article, written by Technology Editor Dennis Denney, contains highlights of paper OTC 18820, "The Use of Subsea Gas Lift in Deepwater Applications," by Subash S. Jayawardena, George J. Zabaras, SPE, and Leonid A. Dykhno, Shell Global Solutions, prepared for the 2007 Offshore Technology Conference, Houston, 30 April-3 May. The paper has not been peer reviewed. Riser-base gas lift is used in subsea developments for production enhancement. It is an effective method to suppress severe slugging that occurs in flowlines with downhill inclination. In some cases, gas lift can aid blow-down for hydrate prevention. Gas lift is not always needed because its effectiveness depends on reservoir performance, fluid properties, seabed terrain, subsea architecture, and flowline and riser specifications. The need for gas lift, optimal operability, and system design should be assessed from various aspects, including flow assurance. A generic set of guidelines was developed on the basis of past experience with riser gas lift applications for different deepwater subsea projects and associated multiphase-flow phenomena.    Introduction This paper discusses riser-base gas lift for deepwater subsea oil-production systems. The focus is how flow-assurance concerns affect various engineering decisions in designing a gas lift system. Riser-base gas lift is injection of a predetermined rate of gas from the host facility into the production flow-line (riser) at the seafloor. The reasons for gas lifting can vary, but the most important pertain to flow assurance, production enhancement, flow stabilization, and flowline depressurization. Why Gas Lift Is Needed The stages of a field’s life should be studied to determine when to install and operate the gas lift system. Gas lift is not always beneficial; in some cases, increasing the gas rate may be detrimental to the performance of the subsea system. Production Enhancement. Gas lift for production enhancement lowers the flowline pressure. Typically, gas lift is needed with high water cuts in the flowlines, low-GOR fluids, and low-to-moderate production rates. The effectiveness is higher in systems with low production-system-inlet pressures. One major advantage of gas lift for production enhancement is that there are no moving parts in the subsea system, apart from valves and chokes. Compression for gas export is almost inevitable in any subsea development; therefore, the supply of lift gas during production is not a major issue. When to use gas lift for production enhancement should be determined by use of integrated (reservoir/wells/flowline) production modeling. The study also should include the water/gas injection to the reservoirs. Accuracy of flowline/riser pressure-drop and liquid-holdup calculations in multiphase-flow models and the accuracy of pressure/volume/temperature predictions are crucial. This accuracy becomes more important in larger-diameter flowlines with deepwater risers in which the multiphase behavior is different from that in smaller-diameter systems.

AB  - AbstractIn a flowline/riser system large liquid slugs and surges can be formed by operational changes or due to the flow conditions and physical characteristics of the flowline. These liquid slugs and gas surges may result in large oil and gas production losses when they arrive at a production platform. Slugging may cause high-level trips in separators and lead to unstable operation of topside facilities. The S3® Slug Suppression System provides a reliable solution to the slugging problem.In 2002 Dril-Quip (Europe) Ltd delivered the first two commercial S3 units to Shell UK Exploration and Production (Shell Expro). The first unit was designed for the Otter development (TotalFinaElf) in the North Sea and installed on the North Cormorant platform (13 km flowline, 12" riser diameter, 18 bara separator pressure). In October 2002 the unit was successfully commissioned and is presently operating. The second system has been installed on the Brent Charlie platform in the North Sea, and is used for the Penguins development (64 km flowline, 14" riser diameter, 35 bara separator pressure). The unit was commissioned in January 2003. The commissioning results prove that the S3 can control liquid slugs and gas surges. The operational data shows that the control strategy is robust, flexible and capable of operating within all flow regimes encountered in the flowline.The S3 system consists of a small separator with dynamically controlled valves at the gas and liquid outlets. The system is placed just upstream of the production separator. Shell Global Solutions developed the system with advanced control algorithms over the past years. The new technology was successfully tested at a test rig in Amsterdam and during field trials at the Shell Expro Gannet Alpha platform [1]. Operation of the S3 system was also extensively simulated with the dynamic numerical tools Traflow and Olga2000 and compared to other slug mitigation methods. An exclusive license was granted to Dril-Quip (Europe) Ltd to manufacture and supply the S3. Based on the field experience with the system, the S3 has proven to control/mitigate slugging.IntroductionIn a flowline/riser system two types of slugging are distinguished: severe and transient slugging.Severe slugging is the worst case of gravity-induced slugs. Gravity induced slugs are formed in the low points of a pipeline, where liquid accumulates and blocks the line. If the hydrostatic pressure build-up exceeds the gas pressure build-up in the flowline, the inclined part of the line will be filled with liquid before the gas pressure will drive the liquid slug out of the line.Transient slugs have another origin compared with gravity-induced slugs. A transient slug can be generated by an operational change (e.g. the increase of production which may effect the gas-liquid ratio in the line) or by instability of the gas/liquid interface. The pipeline is not necessarily blocked by the liquid, but a region with a higher liquid hold-up travels like a wave through the pipeline. Transient slugs, which are generated by instability of the gas/liquid interface, can occur in separated flow conditions and may be stable and increase in size.The main impact of slugging is production deferment caused by:platform trips as a result of slugsinefficient utilization of the first stage separator, since part of its volume is needed for slug catchingprocess instabilities, which decrease separator efficiency and cause unsteady operation of compressors, heat exchangers etc.slow well bean-up to avoid the formation of large slugstop-side choking to restrict the liquid productionThe standard approach to the liquid slugging problem is the installation of a large slugcatcher or topside choking. Sometimes an "intelligent choke" is applied that is placed upstream of the production separator and maintains an acceptable liquid level in the production separator.
