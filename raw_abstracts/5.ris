AB  - Abstract A population of over 270 wells, including over 80 Marcellus wells, was investigated to assess the impact of various early production management strategies, with attention given to the time delay between stimulation and first production, often referred to as the "resting?? or "soak?? period and the effect of subsequent shut-ins.  Subsets of this population were used to perform the various evaluations.  Four significant control factors became apparent.  The use of non-volatile interfacial tension management chemistry and the rate of change of the surface flowing pressure significantly impacted the long-term performance of the wells.  The use of the IFT chemistry significantly mitigated, but did not prevent, damage arising from delay to first production or shut-ins. Based on the performance metric used, delay to first production is not beneficial.  However, based on other data, the probability of improvement with IFT management was less than one in four and without IFT management was about one in eight.  Once on production, the rate with which the flowing pressure was decreased had an important impact on the reservoir / wellbore connectivity.  If the rate of surface flowing pressure decrease was greater than about 250 psi per day, the loss of connectivity was obvious.  The last control factor was the benefit derived from using high conductivity proppants, in conjunction with the IFT management achieved with persistent Interfacial Tension Modifier fluids. Introduction The practice of delaying first production after fracture stimulation of the multi-stage horizontal well completions is widely perceived as a beneficial operating strategy.  The same practice was historically used in vertical wells (11). The subsequent events of intentional or unexpected shut-ins are a part of everyday well operations.  A modest body of current literature is being developed regarding the management of first production (1 - 7).  However, there is very limited literature on the impact of either delay to first production or the impact of shut-ins (12, 13).  There may be other literature, but it was not obvious from an inspection of the SPE One Petro library.  However, from the examination of a relatively large group of wells, it has become apparent that the well performance metric of connectivity between the reservoir and the wellbore, as measured by the "apparent fracture length??, suggests that the delay or soak time post-stimulation and the frequent shut-ins are, in fact, detrimental, rather than the perceived beneficial strategy.  High rates of wellhead pressure change during the first production period are obviously detrimental.  And the use of high conductivity proppants in conjunction with interfacial tension management is clearly beneficial. Methodology The analysis of this body of data relied on the availability of hourly rates and pressures when available and daily data in all cases.  The well's performance and performance metrics were determined using methods previously published (9 - 11).  The primary metric used for this assessment will be referred to as the "apparent fracture length??, realizing that the number is not indicative of any measurable entity in the reservoir or adjacent to the wellbore.  It is a surrogate for describing the degree of connectivity between the reservoir and the wellbore, nothing more.  Three major discrepancies arise from its use: 1) the metric's "length?? is dependent on the actual and unknowable fracture height contribution as the square root of that contributing height, 2) the computation of that "length?? is predicated on the assumption that the fracture is efficiently voided of liquids, which is not the case in any of the wells in this study and 3) the overprint and contribution of the natural fracture system.  Nevertheless, it is felt that the metric still provides a meaningful relative indicator of that connectivity.  If for those reasons alone, there should be no expectation that the calculated values resemble any expected "fracture length?? value.

AB  - ABSTRACT: The Khuff gas is the main source or energy in the State of Bahrain. The production from Khuff reservoir was started in 1969 when the country decided to embark into a major industrialization program. Since that time, 20 wells were drilled and completed in the Khuff zones and all these wells have been producing smoothly and without any major producing smoothly and without any major mechanical failure. Recently, the later stage wells which are mostly in peripheral locations have exhibited some problems like relatively low deliverability compared to other Khuff wells, high H2S production and downhole scaling problems. problems. This paper discusses the recently detected problems and suggests remedial work. Also, problems and suggests remedial work. Also, it proposes modifications in the current completion or Khuff wells specifically the completion design, completion fluid, sequence or perforation, testing and stimulation or the producing zones Introduction The first commercial development Khuff Wells in Bahrain Field were drilled in 1969 to meet the demand for a newly constructed aluminium smelter with an initial production of 50 MMSCFD. The gas production then started to increase to meet the continual expansion or power plants and gas-dependant industries. Over the last two decades gas consumption has increased at an annual rate or 15 percent. Therefore 18 additional wells were drilled during this period to cater for this rapid increase. Four more Khuff wells are to be drilled in 1991/92 to meet the ever-increasing gas demand on the island. An alternative and more economically attractive way or increasing the Khuff gas supply is to improve production from existing Khuff wells. The deliverability of Khuff wells varies based on location and zone(s) or completion. Over the last twenty years, the production from Khuff wells has been very production from Khuff wells has been very smooth with no major mechanical failures. Only five workover jobs were performed, all aimed at isolating tubing to annulus communication. However, some of the last batch or wells drilled in peripheral locations, specially in the northern side are showing relatively higher H2S production, downhole scale build-up, and consequently, lower production. The productivity or these wells can be significantly improved by cleaning out wellbores, performing acid stimulations and perhaps by workovers. This paper will present the completion policy or Khuff wells in Bahrain, production performance, the problems associated with performance, the problems associated with existing wells and the steps taken or planned to improve production or low producers. RESERVOIR and FLUID CHARACTERISTICS: The Khuff Formation is or middle and late Permian age with the top at around -9000'. It Permian age with the top at around -9000'. It consists or 2100' or dolomitized carbonate rocks with thin beds and modules or anhydrite. It is overlain by the Triassic Sudair Formation. The lower contact is marked by an unconformity. The Khuff formation is divided into four zones, KO, I, II and III with KI and KII being the principle gas producing zones in the field. The KO is the uppermost unit. It has an oomoldic porous zone and usually contains several thin stray intervals. The KI is about 500 feet thick having extreme vertical variation in porosity and permeability. permeability. P. 875

AB  - AbstractLaboratory studies and field case histories are presented that demonstrate enhanced well productivity when selection and formulation of solids-free, high density completion fluids are optimized prior to field use. Results of return permeability studies and compatibility tests between completion fluids and formation fluids are presented. These results illustrate the tendency for high density completion fluids to form stable emulsions with certain crude oils. Studies supporting the treatment of these fluids with non-emulsifiers, surface tension reducing surfactants or mutual solvents to reduce formation damage are discussed. Preliminary data describing unique chemistry of calcium chloride, calcium bromide and zinc bromide solutions are provided. These properties influence recovery of high density fluids from oil or gas formations.IntroductionThe chloride and bromide salts of calcium and zinc are highly soluble in water. In combination, solutions of up to 19.2 pounds per gallon (ppg) density can be obtained. These solids-free solutions, commonly referred to as high density (HD) brines, are widely utilized in completion and work-over operations. The ability to achieve hydrostatic well control without solids has made HD brines the work horse of the completion industry. As pure solutions, HD fluids are inherently stable and relatively compatible with both well operations and petroleum bearing formations. Nonetheless, HD brines are most economically utilized when completion and work-over operations are engineered to minimize fluid losses to the productive interval. Reduced fluid costs and enhanced well productivity are the result.One objective of this paper was to provide experimental data not previously published and that may impact the interaction of HD fluids with formation matrix. Load water recovery, fluid-fluid compatibility and shale/clay stability are areas of particular interest. Data presented in this paper include: (l) activity of water for various HD solutions, (2) viscosity of brines as a function of composition and temperature, (3) surface tension of typical HD brines, and (4) capillary suction time (CST) after exposure to clay minerals. Core flow studies using field and Berea cores were conducted to evaluate recovery of reference fluid (formation water, oil or gas) after saturation with HD completion fluid. In all core flow studies, fluid permeability was calculated. Several tests included ion analysis of the core effluents by inductively coupled plasma emission spectroscopy (ICP).

AB  - Abstract Due to "condensate blocking" near well-bore, well deliverability in the gas condensate reservoir often decreases from initial value. This deliverability loss has been investigated by conducting a series of compositional simulations with an actual reservoir data. The well gas productivity index (PI) at initial reservoir pressure of 4750 psia for a single-phase gas flow was found to drop rapidly approximately 10% to 35% due to single phase transient effects. As the reservoir pressure drops below the dew point pressure, this PI drop slows down but continually losses for 20% till movable oil saturation reaches in reservoir. Then another further rapid loss of about 20% of the initial gas PI occurs due to the oil flow and later a continued loss come in PI as reservoir pressure declines. The gas PI at a reservoir pressure of 2000 psia is only 10-20% of the initial value (at reservoir pressure 4750 psia). We also found that both fluids PVT and absolute permeability of the reservoir have significant influences on the well productivity. IntroductionIn gas condensate reservoirs, when the flowing bottomhole pressure falls below the dew point pressure of the reservoir fluid, condensate liquid starts to drop out from gas and a relatively high liquid saturation builds up near the wellbore will occur. This liquid saturation build-up leads to a reduction in gas relative permeabilities and thus a loss in gas well productivity. This effect is referred to as "condensate blocking" in the literature (1, 2, 3) . Due to this "condensate blocking" near well-bore, well deliverability in the gas condensate reservoir often decreases from initial value. This deliverability loss has been investigated by conducting a series of compositional simulations with an actual reservoir data in this paper. Gas Condensate Flow Behavior A model that describes the subsurface gas condensate flow recognizes the existence of three regions, as presented in Figure 1. Whitson (3) divided the flow in the condensate reservoir into following three regions. Region 1: An inner near-wellbore region where both gas and oil flow simultaneously at different velocities. This region has a constant flowing Gas-Oil ratio (GOR) equal to the producing GOR. The size of region 1 increases with time and stabilizes when the single phase gas entering this region has sufficient mobility for it to flow without any net accumulation. Region 2: This region defines the net accumulation of condensate in sections of the reservoir where the pressure is below the gas dew point pressure. There is only gas flow (no liquid) in this region as the condensate is immobile. This is a region of liquid saturation build-up. Region 3: This region consists of single phase gas as the pressure in this region is above the dew point pressure. There is no hydrocarbon liquid in this region. Model DescriptionIn order to investigate factors contributing to gas-flow impairment due to condensate buildup, single-well radial compositional reservoir simulation models were extracted from the earth model with an out boundary of 3000ft.

AB  - Summary With the growing interest in low-permeability gas plays, foam fracturing fluids are now well established as a viable alternative to traditional fracturing fluids. Present practices in energized fracturing treatments remain, nonetheless, rudimentary in comparison to other fracturing-fluid technologies because of our limited understanding of multiphase fluid-loss and phase behavior occurring in these complex fluids. This paper assesses the fluid-loss benefits introduced by energizing the fracturing fluid. A new laboratory apparatus has been specifically designed and built for measuring the leakoff rates for both gas and liquid phases under dynamic fluid-loss conditions. This paper provides experimental leakoff results for linear guar gels and for N2/guar foam-based fracturing fluids under a wide range of fracturing conditions. In particular, the effects of the rock permeability, the foam quality, and the pressure drop are investigated. Analysis of dynamic leakoff data provides an understanding of the complex mechanisms of viscous invasion and filter-cake formation occurring at the pore scale. This study presents data supporting the superior fluid-loss behavior of foams, which exhibit minor liquid invasion and limited damage. It also shows direct measurements of the ability of the gas component to leakoff into the invaded zone, thereby increasing the gas saturation around the fracture and enhancing the gas productivity during flowback. Our conclusions not only confirm but add to the findings of McGowen and Vitthal (1996a, b) for linear gels and the findings of Harris (1985) for nitrogen foams.

AB  - SPE Members Abstract A computer model based on the Darcy solution to the Radial Diffusivity Equation was written to evaluate perforated oilwell completions. The model was verified using standard well testing techniques and compares favorably with similar models written previously. The results of this study clearly point to these conclusions: 1. Normal amounts of well and perforation damage reduce four shot per foot (0.305 M) productivity to an unacceptable level. Twelve shots per foot (0.305 m) is recommended for future completions. 2. Gun phasing affects productivity. Sixty degree phasing gives the best results, with productivity reductions for larger angles. 3. Perforation length should be maximized at the expense of hole diameter, down to a diameter of 0.25 inches (0.64 cm). 4. Gun standoff decreases penetration of small diameter, through-tubing guns. These should be avoided where possible. Introduction The chief purpose of this study was 0 evaluate the perforated oilwell completion computer modeling fluid flow through a porous media into a wellbore. We developed a three-dimensional computer model (dimensions r, 0, and Z) that simulates flow through a multi-layered cylindrical reservoir. Perforations were modeled by setting the porosity equal to 1.0 and the permeability equal to 1,000,000 darcies in the permeability equal to 1,000,000 darcies in the perforation blocks. Radial permeability damage perforation blocks. Radial permeability damage surrounding the wellbore and a thin zone of reduced permeability around each perforation can also be included. Each perforation's length can be varied independently to simulate the effects of gun standoff. The model was used to evaluate perforated well completions, particularly the effects of radial well damage, the near-perforation crushed zone, and vertical-to-horizontal permeability ratios less than 1.0. The individual effects of these parameters are fairly well documented. However, to our knowledge no one has modeled the cumulative effect of these variables. We also studied the effect of ultra-high density perforating. Previous authors modeled a maximum perforation density of eight shots per foot (0.305 m), but did not spiral the perfs in a realistic phasing pattern. Our study perfs in a realistic phasing pattern. Our study investigated the performance of eight, twelve, and twenty-four shots per foot (0.305 m), all with realistic phasing and spiraling. We also modeled the effects of 9, 180, 120, 90, and 60 degree phasing. We found that productivity continues to increase up to a level of at least twenty-four shots per foot (0.305 m). Also, smaller phasing angles increase productivity, although the differences are minimal for angles smaller that 180 degrees. Finally, we analysed the effect of penetration loss due to gun standoff on overall well penetration loss due to gun standoff on overall well productivity. Small diameter through-tubing productivity. Small diameter through-tubing guns experience reduced penetration unless the gun is within one half inch of the casing. if the gun is significantly smaller than the casing, some standoff is inevitable. Penetration loss due to gun standoff can significantly inhibit well performance. P. 375

AB  - Abstract Artificial lift systems (ALS) should be thoroughly analyzed to minimize non-productive time, increase production and reserves, reduce cost and failure, and maximize capital efficiency. This work proposes a novel systematic for ALS analysis approach that implements data analytics for historical performance tracking and benchmarking, heuristic diagnostics for suboptimal identification, and reliable model-based solutions for opportunity evaluation. The proposed methodology follows the principles of integrated reservoir management and greatly reduces the time to manage ALS systems by combining expert knowledge, data analysis with model-based calculation in pursuit of extreme efficiency and high accuracy. Our efficient workflow builds from intelligent data pre-processing capabilities, which facilitate fast and structured analysis of complex datasets. The metrics and scoreboard are intuitive, comprehensive and unique, and are scarcely documented in technical literature. These evaluations from various aspects generate different paths for asset management with diversified views. By following a very systematic approach and incorporating industry standards and propriety analysis and metrics, this workflow leads to fast delivery of analysis/results that enable production engineers to make smarter decisions faster. Our solution makes the analysis unbiased, and integration of new datasets super easy. This could greatly benefit executive decision-making and operational practices in a field.

AB  - SPE Members Abstract Gas condensate wells, producing at a flowing bottom-hole pressure below the dewpoint suffer a more rapid decline in productivity than that predicted in theory for dry gas wells. The loss in productivity is caused by a liquid hydrocarbon accumulation near the wellbore. A compositional one-dimensional radial model has been used to predict the performance of a gas condensate well . The effect of composition (fluid properties, liquid dropout rate) and gas-oil relate properties, liquid dropout rate) and gas-oil relate permeability on gas productivity have been permeability on gas productivity have been investigated. Results show that relative permeability data is the most sensitive parameter in determining productivity loss. The predicted productivity decline of a productivity loss. The predicted productivity decline of a gas condensate well using drainage and imbibition relative permeability data vary considerably. Introduction Production data for some gas condensate producing wells have shown that the productivity is producing wells have shown that the productivity is severely curtailed when flowing bottom-hole pressure falls below the dewpoint pressure of the fluid in place. It is generally accepted that this reduction place. It is generally accepted that this reduction is caused by condensed liquid near the wellbore. The purpose of this paper is to: (1) show the effect of condensate accumulation on well productivity; and (2) evaluate the dependence of productivity; and (2) evaluate the dependence of predicted productivity decline on phase equilibrium predicted productivity decline on phase equilibrium data and relative permeability characteristics. To accomplish the objective a compositional numerical simulator was used to construct a radial flow model representing a single well in an infinite acting reservoir. MODEL DESCRIPTION The simulator used for this study was the Intercomp SSI Comp II equation of state compositional model. Comp 11 uses a cyclic IMPES (Implicit Pressure Explicit Saturation) formulation and is Pressure Explicit Saturation) formulation and is capable three dimensions and three phases. The equation of state for phase phases. The equation of state for phase equilibrium data provides smoothness and consistency to fluid properties. A one-dimensional radial model was constructed with a single producing well located at the center. The grid is composed of logarithmically distributed radial nodes. The innermost node size is .25 ft (.076 m), while the outer node is 2,970 ft (905.2 m) wide. The single productive layer is 25 ft (7.6 m) thick, with a porosity of 16 percent, and absolute permeability of 10 md. To reduce the complexity of permeability of 10 md. To reduce the complexity of three phases in the model, the immobile water saturation is eliminated by using an effective hydrocarbon porosity and permeability. The model was verified by matching an analytical solution having a dimensionless radial distance (rD) equal to 2.0 (Figure 1). One objective of this study was to investigate the sensitivity of liquid accumulation and productivity decline to composition. Two gas compositions productivity decline to composition. Two gas compositions were investigated. The measured properties were matched using an equation of state program. Table 1 summarizes the fluid properties for compositions A and B. The maximum volume percent liquid ranges between 5 and 22 percent (Figure 2). The initial liquid yield of the two fluids investigated is 90 (5.0 X 10-4 m3 /m3 and 200 bbl/MMscf (1.11 x 10-3 M3 /m 3) (compositions A and B respectively.) Another factor influencing the productivity decline of a gas condensate well is gas-oil relative permeability data. permeability data.

AB  - Abstract Reported are the results of an experimental programme to investigate the influence of mud composition, pressure and temperature on the properties of filter cakes formed during static filtration. Three water-based muds were tested at pressures up to 4.2 MPa and temperatures up to 93C. The spurt loss, cumulative fluid loss, cake thickness and porosity were measured and, using a modified static filtration equation, the cake resistance and compressibility were calculated. The results clearly illustrate the highly compressible nature of filter cakes formed from drilling muds. Also shown is the profound influence of barite and temperature on the cake properties and fluid loss. Using expressions developed in the general field of solid-liquid separation for the variation in porosity within the filter cake, the behaviour of highly compressible cakes under pressure has been illustrated. Introduction The filtration properties are an important characteristic of all drilling fluids. The leak-off of filtrate into the formation can substantially reduce the permeability of the near-wellbore region by a number of mechanisms; most importantly particle plugging, clay swelling, particle migration and water blocking. In addition the nature and thickness of the filter cake deposited on the borehole wall will influence the potential for differential pressure sticking to occur. Usually only the 30 minute fluid loss, at either ambient or elevated temperature and at a single pressure is measured. Little is known about the properties of the filter cake and their dependence on the mud constituents, pressure and temperature. This paper discusses some of the results of a large experimental programme designed to investigate in detail the relationship between the cake structure, as characterised by the cake compressibility and resistance, and fluid loss, spurt loss and cake thickness and the influence of pressure, temperature and mud component concentration. THEORY Flow Through Filter Cakes As suspended solids are deposited during cake filtration, liquid flows, as a result of the hydraulic pressure gradient, through the cake interstices. A drag force is therefore exerted on the solid particles and is cumulative as liquid moves towards the filter medium. On moving through the cake from the surface towards the filter medium the drag pressure, Ps, increases and the hydraulic pressure, PL, decreases. If the cake is incompressible then no compaction of the solids occurs as a result of the drag pressure and the porosity is constant throughout the cake. However, virtually all filter cakes do undergo some compaction of the solids as Ps increases. These compressible filter cakes exhibit non-linear permeability and porosity profiles, with the porosity a maximum at the cake surface (Ps = O) and a minimum at the filter medium surface (Ps = P). Average Specific Cake Resistance and Porosity The theoretical treatment of filtration is based on the following concepts: (1) Flow through filter cakes is laminar (2) All of the factors contributing to the resistance of the filter cake to fluid flow can P. 705^

AB  - Abstract An alternative system to conventional HEC (hydroxyethylcellulose) and particulate fluid loss materials has been developed for fluid loss control in high permeability Gulf of Mexico Flexure trend completions. In offshore operations, the problem of controlling fluid loss to the formation is critical in achieving successful gravel pack completions. The problem is magnified in this environment because of the use of expensive high density brine, lost rig time, and increased standards for well control and safety. A newly developed fluid loss system which consists of a crosslinkable, derivatized HEC incorporating a branched functional group on an HEC backbone has been evolving in the industry. The functional group provides a nonionic reaction site which allows the polymer to be crosslinked at a low pH, and broken in a controlled manner using a newly pH, and broken in a controlled manner using a newly developed breaker. Other fluid loss control systems used in Flexure trend completions exhibit specific problems which can be attributed to (1) physical properties of the particular material, and (2) the method of application. For instance, in many high permeability wells, noncrosslinkable HEC pills have permeability wells, noncrosslinkable HEC pills have proven inadequate for controlling fluid loss to an proven inadequate for controlling fluid loss to an acceptable level, and in some cases have allowed significant invasion of HEC, thus potentially resulting in permeability impairment. Particulate fluid loss materials present other problems in that they can be difficult to remove from perforations. Laboratory and field tests demonstrate efficient fluid loss control and potential for reduced formation damage with this new crosslinkable HEC (CLHEC). Internally broken crosslinked gel has shown more favorable return permeability in core tests than regular HEC polymer commonly used in the industry. The CLHEC system deposits a thin, crosslinked polymer filter cake which helps prevent fluid loss, but which can be removed by means of an internal breaker, an acid wash, or both. Subject paper presents laboratory and field data illustrating paper presents laboratory and field data illustrating properties of the new fluid loss control system in properties of the new fluid loss control system in high density brine applications. Introduction Fluid loss control in offshore gravel pack completions has become an important subject in recent years with the increased awareness of the adverse effects inadequate fluid loss control and some fluid loss materials can have on gravel placement and well productivity. productivity. Controlling fluid loss rate before, during, and following gravel pack placement is essential in Flexure trend completions to prevent (1) formation damage, and (2) loss of expensive high density brines used to provide well control in high permeability unconsolidated sandstones. This situation is compounded by the relatively high overbalance pressures required to control high pressure pressures required to control high pressure formations. Excessive fluid losses in this environment can lead to unsafe well conditions. Conventional fluid loss control systems applicable to gravel pack completions can be grouped into two general categories: particulate systems and gel systems. Particulate systems may include oil, acid, or water-soluble, properly sized particles. Gel systems can include a number of high viscosity gel pills. A crosslinkable HEC fluid loss control system has recently been applied to Gulf of Mexico Flexure trend completions as an alternative to conventional methods of fluid loss control which is especially applicable, but not limited to these high productivity Gulf of Mexico completions. productivity Gulf of Mexico completions.

AB  - AbstractAs drilling and completion technology advances, the trend to exploitation of gas reservoirs exhibiting ever lower permeabilities continues. This paper discusses issues associated with the identification of productive, low permeability, gas-producing formations and the successful completion and production of these reservoirs. For the purposes of this paper, a very low permeability gas reservoir is defined as a formation having an in-situ matrix permeability to gas of 0.5 mD or less. Criteria are presented for identifying economic absolute permeability cutoffs for low permeability gas-bearing formations. Very low permeability gas reservoirs are typically in a state of capillary undersaturation where the initial water (and sometimes oil) saturation is less than would be expected from conventional capillary mechanics for the pore system under consideration. These formations are commonly referred to as dehydrated or desiccated formations and have been documented on a worldwide basis. Retention of fluids (phase trapping) is discussed as one of the major mechanisms of reduced productivity, even in successfully fractured completions in these types of formations. As well, a variety of diagnostic and remedial treatment options are presented. IntroductionAs the oil and gas industry matures, ongoing reservoir targets move towards more challenging applications commonly exhibiting low permeability and often low pressure. One particular area which has received increased emphasis in recent years is the production of gas from extremely low permeability formations. Considerable effort has been expended in a number of areas in the Deep Basin area in Canada, the Powder River Basin in the Central United States and in the Permian Basin in the Texas area in attempting to exploit gas reservoirs with average insitu permeability in the 100 micro-Darcy (0.1 mD] or less range. This paper details a number of issues which center around the ability to first diagnose whether a particular reservoir will be an economic candidate for viable gas production and secondly, to evaluate what are the best drilling, completion, and ultimate production practices for such wells to obtain the maximum flow rates and ultimate recoverable reserves of natural gas.What is a Low Permeability Gas Reservoir?The definition of a low permeability gas reservoir is arbitrary but, for the purposes of this presentation, we will consider such a reservoir to be a reservoir matrix which has an effective insitu permeability to gas of less than 0.5 mD and contains a potentially mobile gas saturation. Extensive reserves of natural gas are present on a worldwide basis in both sandstone and carbonate formations which exhibit these properties. Although such permeabilities would be prohibitive for the economic production of conventional crude oil, they may still be feasible for gas production. In many situations, due to the low inherent viscosity of natural gas, the high initial pressure of the producing formations, if sufficient reservoir penetration and exposure to the low permeability producing zone can be obtained in an economic fashion, long-term production of significant volumes of gas may be realized.When addressing the potential productivity of the low permeability gas reservoir, three major issues are of paramount concern. 1. Does the reservoir exhibit sufficient initial permeability and pressure to facilitate economic gas production rates, even in the presence of a successful large-scale stimulation treatment?2. Are the initial water and liquid hydrocarbon saturations that are trapped within the reservoir matrix low enough to create sufficient gas reserves in place and adequate initial permeability for economic gas production? 3. What potential forms of formation damage can occur during drilling and completion operations or subsequent production operations, that may reduce the ultimate productive capacity of the reservoir?

AB  - Abstract While production from shale formation has been made possible mainly by advances in horizontal drilling and hydraulic fracturing, there are still many challenges in production from these reserves. While slick water fracturing technique stimulates a large reservoir volume through generation of complex fracture systems, very sharp production decline has been observed in many reservoirs. One of the main reason for this rapid decline is the limited contribution to flow from smaller fracture networks generated, which do not received much proppant. These proppant-less artificial and natural fractures heal up once the net pressure in the fracture goes below the closure stress and hence reduce the producible region only to the primary fractures. To make the production from the shale plays sustainable over the life of a well, there is a need to make sure that the network of natural fractures, secondary, and tertiary artificial fractures are conductive and remain productive even after increase in closure stress. While generation of massive fracture system will not be possible without low viscosity slick water, proppant placement will be limited only to the primary fractures with this technique. In order to overcome this challenge of low conductivity fracture network, we tested a technique of combining reactive fluid with slick water fracturing.

AB  - Abstract The following paper will detail the use of a high angle electric submersible pump (ESP) tangent in Northern Oklahoma Horizontal Oil and Gas Wells to maximize ESP drawdown at the sandface by enhancing gas separation at the ESP intake. ESP performance expectations in horizontal wells can be severely diminished due to gas interference which can cause rapid head degradation in the ESP system. Understanding how the gravitational effects on the fluid stream can alter flow patterns in a horizontal wellbore is paramount to achieving the most cost effective solution for avoiding gas at the ESP intake while maximizing drawdown. Failure to consider how changes in wellbore deviation may alter fluid flow in deviated ESP operations before a well is drilled and completed may result in a completion design where the ultimate hydrocarbon recovery is partially inhibited due to gas interference. Results detailed from Northern Oklahoma Horizontal Oil and Gas Wells indicate that the use of a high angle pump tangent in ESP operations was able to help accomplish greater than 90% gas separation at the intake of an ESP at bottom hole pressures less than 100 psia and gas-to-liquid ratios in excess of 2000 scf/bbl. The application of advanced horizontal well technology has increased the demand for cost effective and reliable ESP solutions which mitigate the negative economic effects of prolonged downtime and repair costs associated with the challenges of operating in the modern horizontal wellbore environment. Conventional ESP design methodology for effective gas avoidance and deliquification in the vertical wellbore environment does not address the changes in multi-phase fluid behavior and flow patterns that are encountered as the wellbore is deviated in excess of 85 degrees from vertical.

AB  - AbstractThe productivity of the wells in a moderately rich gas condensate reservoir was observed to initially decrease rapidly and then increase as the reservoir was depleted. All wells in the field showed the same response. Compositional simulation explained the reasons for these productivity changes.During early production, a ring of condensate rapidly formed around each wellbore when the near-wellbore pressures decreased below the dew point pressure of the reservoir gas. The saturation of condensate in this ring was considerably higher than the maximum condensate predicted by the PVT laboratory work due to relative permeability effects. This high condensate saturation in the ring severely reduced the effective permeability to gas, thereby reducing gas productivity.After pressure throughout the reservoir decreased below the dew point condensate formed throughout the reservoir, thus the gas flowing into the ring became leaner causing the condensate saturation in the ring to decrease. This increased the effective permeability of the gas. This caused the gas productivity to increase as was observed in the field.There were also changes in gas and condensate compositions in the reservoir which affected viscosities and densities of the fluids. These effects also impacted gas productivity.This work is another step forward in our understanding of the dynamics of condensate buildup around wellbores in gas condensate fields.IntroductionWells in gas condensate reservoirs often experience rapid decline when the near wellbore pressure goes below the dew point pressure. Several investigators1-6 have reported on well productivity of gas condensate reservoirs. Radial compositional simulation models were often used to investigate the problem of productivity loss1-5. These models clearly showed that the loss in productivity was due to liquid drop out around the wellbore. This so called condensate blocking (increase in condensate saturation around the wellbore) reduces the effective permeability to gas and results in rapid decline in well productivity once the near wellbore pressure drops below the dew point. The effect of condensate blocking is more evident in low permeability reservoirs. Barnum et al.7 have noticed that the recovery factor of gas condensate wells is only affected by condensate blocking if the well's kh is less than 1,000 md-ft. For higher quality reservoirs, productivity loss is not very severe.Figs 1, 2, and 3 show the performance of three different wells producing from the same reservoir. They show the rapid decline common to most gas condensate wells when they go below the dew point. However, they all show approximately stable gas production after the period of initial decline and, more importantly, a subsequent increase in gas production rate. The increase in rate is not due to any improved recovery technique since no fluid injection and no changes in operating conditions have ever taken place in this reservoir.History Match with a Compositional Simulation ModelWe constructed a radial, single-well compositional model to investigate the behavior of one of the wells (well A). The model consisted of one layer with 36 grid blocks in the radial direction. We started with a 0.5 ft. grid block near the well, increased the size logarithmically to gird block 10, and then used uniform grids of 100 ft. afterwards. A 9-component equation of state (EOS) formulation was used. An imbibition gas-oil relative permeability data set in presence of irreducible water was used (Fig. 4). History matching was performed in an attempt to explain the uncommon behavior of the well. The model was constrained by gas rate while reservoir properties were changed to match average reservoir pressure and condensate production rate. Fig. 5 shows the match between actual and simulated condensate production rate. Permeability, porosity, and permeability distribution of the model were altered to achieve this match.

AB  - Abstract There is not yet a defined relationship between stimulation volume and long term producing volume in low permeability (nanodarcy scale) “reservoirs”. To quantitatively describe producing volume, we define the distances at which stimulated horizontal wells show sustained connectivity by interpreting field pressure data to understand communication with neighboring wells over a series of time steps at 2, 6, 8, and 12 months after completion. We show how to design and execute pressure transient tests, how these field results yield conclusive evidence of proper well spacing, and how other methods to assess stimulated reservoir volumes compare. Our procedure takes weeks to perform, and may be applied to make unplanned shut-in events useful reservoir characterization tools. Coordination between geology, reservoir engineering, and field engineers is required to successfully execute these tests. The results show we have a powerful tool for tuning of development plans well in advance of years' worth of production commonly used for such decisions. From frac hits, microseismic, and tracer results we observe a continuous reduction in the stimulated volume around horizontal wells from the instant of completion through early production. To describe the continued evolution of the producing volume, we define producing volume half-lengths at 2, 6, 8, and 12 months. Armed with measurements of half-length stabilization in the early months of production, we confidently define the upper limit of well spacing for future development. Although we cannot yet define economically optimal overlap between producing volumes, this upper limit allows operating groups to set the correct length scale for future investigations. Results from our pressure communication studies are compatible with other methods of greater uncertainty, longer timelines, and higher cost. Traced fluid and proppant, microseismic events, and frac hits represent stimulation that may not relate to long term productivity. Pressure communication between stimulated wellbores defines the capability of the stimulation to maintain permeability at the test production time step. However, these other measurements do help bound the evolution of stimulated reservoir volumes in a manner compatible with our pressure communication results.

AB  - The article describes a computational technology to optimize a reservoir development system with known well locations. It includes a number of algorithms for determining the optimal options of setting injection and production wells or well perforation intervals. The proposed technology is based on a combination of the Lagrange-Pontryagin formalism, the analytical solutions of flow equations, and a "greedy" algorithm. Such an approach to the problem ensures a hugegain in computation time, even for fields with a large number of wells. The best well perforation intervals were determined in terms of oil recovery or the development system economics, or well perforation intervals in symmetric elements of different well patterns with a nonuniform distribution of flow properties using real fields. The computational efficiency of the proposed algorithms was studied and their benefits in comparison with existing analogues were demonstrated. It has been found that the algorithms allow to get one of the most favorable options of the development system or well perforation intervals in a practicable time.

AB  - Abstract   Banyu Urip Field is a newly developed oil reservoir located in between Central and East Java provinces, Indonesia. The field is currently producing in an early development phase. There are 4 producer wells, 1 gas injector and 1 water injector. The six wells are located on one well pad and production flows to temporary facilities operated by another party.  Two years after starting production, inflow capacity began to rapidly deteriorate in one of the producers; resulting in a decline in overall field deliverability. The declining well is a deviated well which had experienced massive lost circulation while being drilled. The well initially produced at the highest rate among the 4 producers. However after the rapid production decline it produced at the lowest rate of the four producers. This paper describes steps taken in evaluating the root causes of the decline in well productivity. Research and screening mitigation options are also discussed in this paper. Lost circulation materials, plugging, and scale/wax build-up are suspected as potential root causes of the decline in productivity.  Acid stimulation, coiled-tubing cleanup, and re-perforating were identified as possible mitigations. The workover was divided into 2 phases; phase-1 was conducted for data acquisition and phase-2 for execution. Furthermore, this paper continues with describing the well work execution and challenges.

AB  - Abstract There have been various observations about the merits of increasing the proppant volume during hydraulic fracturing of source rocks. A general recommendation has been that larger proppant volumes can help in maintaining fracture flow capacity. In this study, we present data on actual cases related to more than 104 wells producing from the Bakken formation. Two parameters of interest were used as measures of well productivity. First was the average initial flow rate of the well, represented by the cumulative production during the first three months, and then was the production decline represented by the cumulative volume of oil produced in 180 days. Both of these parameters were tested as a function of corresponding sand/liquid ratios for similar completion practices and in the same reservoir. In all cases, we observed an an optimum value for the proppant liquid ratio related to the best case scenarios. Beyond that optimal ratio, the well performance show a deterioration. We attribute this to an overall reduction in fracture conductivity caused by packing of fractures, potential proppant plugging and slurry dehydration under excessive proppants placement.

AB  - Abstract High pressure, low permeability reservoirs have been encountered in various parts of the world within the past few years. Commercial development of these reservoirs may require high drawdowns, possibly in excess of 6,000 psi. The impacts of drawdown in this range are: 1) increases in near wellbore temperatures due to Joule-Thomson expansion of the reservoir fluids and, 2) significant reductions in oil viscosity. The effects of large drawdown are evaluated with a transient, single-phase thermal simulator in which the oil viscosity is modeled as both temperature and pressure dependent and Joule-Thomson expansion of the reservoir fluids is considered. Results indicate near wellbore temperature increases of 4 to 24 ºF for drawdowns between 2,000 to 10,000 psia due to Joule-Thomson expansion of the reservoir oil and connate water. Furthermore, if oil viscosity is not modeled as pressure dependent productivity indices will be under predicted and analysis of well tests will result in estimated skin values lower than actual. Temperature profiles within the formation are presented for a range of rates and drawdowns. Additionally, a comparison of maximum wellbore temperatures and profiles between transient, steady state and macroscopic energy models is presented. Technical rationale is also presented to explain the transient heating or cooling phenomena which occur immediately after a rate change. Synthetic well tests are generated to illustrate the impact of high drawdown on well test interpretation. These tests show a region of improved mobility in the near wellbore region due to the reduction in the oil viscosity. Introduction Commercial production rates for deep, high pressure and low permeability reservoirs may require high drawdowns. This is particularly true if stimulation techniques such as hydraulic fracturing or acidizing are not feasible due to technical limitations, operational constraints or cost. Oil viscosity must be modeled as a function of pressure, and to a lesser extent temperature, for accurate productivity predictions and well test analysis. While the dependency of oil viscosity on pressure and temperature is well established (Bird et al. 2002), applications to drawdowns in the range of 6,000 to 10,000 psi have rarely been considered. The definition of drawdown considered in this study refers to the difference between the pressure at the reservoir outer radius and the wellbore flowing pressure. It does not refer to pressure gradients within the near wellbore region. Drawdowns of this magnitude constrained to the near wellbore region would certainly be catastrophic for either the completion equipment and/or the formation. Joule-Thomson expansion thermal effects within a reservoir are rarely considered as drawdowns are generally not high enough for Joule-Thomson expansion effects to be significant. Most commonly, Joule-Thomson expansion effects are considered as part of wellbore and completion modeling where pressure drops can be considerable (Ouyang and Belanger, 2006). This includes flow within the wellbore, through perforations, liners and sand control equipment. An early study by Steffensen and Smith (1973) discussed Joule-Thomson heating in relation to water injection wells and Joule-Thomson cooling in relation to gas wells. Their objective was to improve the interpretation of temperature logs by accounting for the impact of Joule- Thomson expansion thermal effects on the measured temperatures. They developed a steady state model to predict the temperature change within the near wellbore region due to Joule-Thomson expansion but ignored the heat capacity of the formation. As part of a horizontal wellbore modeling study, Yoshioka et al. (2007) developed a transient, coupled reservoir and wellbore model to predict the temperature changes caused by water or gas entry into the wellbore. However, reservoir drawdowns investigated in this study were low, ranging from 100 to 500 psi, which are typical horizontal well operating conditions.

AB  - Abstract Complex well configurations with long openhole sections are often left unprotected for a long time under various conditions. Oil-based and synthetic-based drilling fluids are very well suited for drilling these long sections down to reservoir formations, providing high rates of penetration, excellent lubrication properties, and wellbore stability. The enhancement in wellbore stability and lubricity as well as reduction in differential sticking, mud losses, and formation damage can be directly influenced by fluid-loss control and filtercake properties. As an example, formation damage is largely caused by solid invasion occurring during the first step of filtration, perhaps adversely affecting the porous media permeability/stability, and consequently, reservoir productivity. Both good fluid-loss control and minimum formation damage are required for drilling and completion fluids. A synthetic polymer, based on a unique microgel structure, has been designed to provide excellent fluid-loss control and low formation damage in OBM/SBM. Optimization of polymer morphology and fluid solubility gives a very versatile and cost-effective fluid-loss additive. The unique microgel structure allows the polymer particles to swell and stack up, forming a thin and efficient filter cake. The ability of the microgel particles to deform under shear stress allows them to be back-produced from the formation more effectively than non-deformable additives, thus reducing risks of formation damage in the pay zone. The polymer also may contribute to the rheology of the mud by providing low shear viscosity under demanding conditions. This paper reviews the effectiveness of the organosoluble polymer by presenting evidence of low formation damage illustrated by good return permeability data from both field and laboratory applications. Finally, data will be presented on new developments based on similar chemistry, allowing applications into more extreme conditions of temperature. Introduction Owing to their excellent lubricity, high rate of penetration and outstanding thermal stability, synthetic-based mud (SBM) and oil-based mud (OBM) systems are often used to drill difficult wells, such as long sections of high angle and/or HTHP wells. However, the risks of having mud loss or invasion into reservoir rocks thus hampering production may become elevated because of long exposure time with the producing zone under overbalanced conditions. Formation damage is largely caused by solids invasion that occurs during the initial stages of filtercake establishment when an internal filtercake is formed. The formation of an impermeable external filtercake is considered essential for minimizing formation damage, and this should take place as soon as the reservoir rock is penetrated. Once the filter cake is established, the filtration process is controlled by the cake itself rather than by the rock. Different additives may be used in OBM/SBM formulations to enhance cake properties and minimize formation damage. These additives may be either dispersed or solubilized in the oil phase.1,2 A new class of synthetic polymers that functions as fluid-loss control and bridging agent is described in this paper. The synthetic polymer represents a range of organosoluble microgels based on a unique microstructure design. The polymer's morphology, solubility, and crosslink density have been optimized to enhance fluid-loss-control performance while maintaining cost effectiveness. The performance of the synthetic polymer in terms of fluid-loss control and formation damage is compared with traditional additives including gilsonite and amine-treated lignite (ATL). Filtration Mechanisms and Characterizations The drilling fluids filtration process is composed of two distinct stages. The first stage (also known as spurt) corresponds to the inception of filtration. It is characterized by a rapid invasion of the porous media by the drilling fluid. During this period, the solids present in the fluid invade the rock. An internal cake is built in the first few centimeters of the invaded formation and the invasion rate will decrease rapidly with good bridging. It has been previously shown that when no interactions exist between the filtrate and the reservoir fluids, the initial spurt loss is the damaging phase and that further fluid loss of the oil filtrate does not change the level of damage imposed by the drilling fluid.3

AB  - Abstract Acidization by HF-containing acids can drastically reduce both the physical strength of synthetic ceramic proppants and the permeability of gravel packs and propped fractures that utilize permeability of gravel packs and propped fractures that utilize these materials. The strength of most acidized ceramics will decrease at a rate faster than implied by weight loss. It is therefore misleading to use weight loss as a measure of stability of ceramic proppants to HF-containing acid. Even seemingly mild acid treatments (low temperature and closure stresses) can have a negative impact on proppant strength and performance. Laboratory measurements on proppant acidized performance. Laboratory measurements on proppant acidized with HCl-HF acid at 176 deg. F. (80 deg C) and 64 deg F (18 deg C) verify major strength losses of synthetic proppants even under mild temperature conditions. These results are supported by observed degradation of intermediate strength proppant (ISP) recovered from an acidized well in a shallow, low-temperature formation. Introduction Previous work has documented dangers of exposing ceramic Previous work has documented dangers of exposing ceramic materials to HF-based acids during well treatments. However, widespread use of ceramic media for sand control (or combined propped fracture/sand control) increases the risk that these materials will eventually be exposed to HF. T his, in fact, did occur. Lack of stimulation of a well that was acidized after being fractured and gravel packed with ISP led to pulling of the gravel pack and examination of the considerable fill found inside the wire-wrapped screen. The fill included a mix of undersize whole and fragmented ISP grains and some unusual crystalline flakes. This study was conducted to determine whether such fill could have arisen from HF acid contact with ISP, and to compare acid sensitivities of various ceramic proppant materials. The HF-based acid examined in this study is a mixture of hydrochloric and hydrofluoric acids (HCl/HF). Fluoboric acid (HBF4) was used in a few experiments. Both were used in the above well. Fluoboric acid hydrolizes to form hydrofluoric acid. At low temperatures this process is slow enough to allow deep penetration into the formation prior to consumption of the generated HF, hence the designation "retarded acid". In both cases the acids are meant to dissolve troublesome silicate minerals in the formation. The most common oilfield HF-acid mixture is HCl/HF. At full-strength the mixture is typically 12 wt % HCl/3 wt % HF, although lower concentrations are often used. The silicate- dissolving component is HF, while HCl increases reactivity of the HF acid and helps keep precipitates from forming by maintaining a low pH3. The mixture is prepared by addition of ammonium bifluoride to HCl acid. Fluoboric acid is prepared by mixing boric acid, ammonium bifluoride, and prepared by mixing boric acid, ammonium bifluoride, and HCl. The final solution is nominally about 7.8 wt % HBF4, and when mixed in the field usually has about 0.6 wt % free HF. MATERIALS Following are described four common gravels/proppants used by the oil industry and in this study. The same materials are used for gravel pack sand and fracture proppant. In this paper we use the term "proppant" to indicate both applications. Nomenclature was chosen to be consistent with previous work. Compositions of the proppants as provided by manufacturers are given in Table I; complex stochiometries have been simplified to their single-oxide percentages. 1. Monocrystalline Sand The most commonly used proppant is quartz sand. The Ottawa sand used here is monocrystalline, i.e., there are no grain boundaries along which acid can attack. It was found to be the most HF-resistant material in our study. 2. High-Density Ceramic This is often referred to as "sintered bauxite", because it is made from bauxite (mixed with additives, including silicates) that has been treated at high temperatures. Properties of such proppants are determined by components in addition to the proppants are determined by components in addition to the alumina into which the bauxite is converted. For this study we refer to these as High-Density Ceramics (HDC). These materials can be distinguished by a specific gravity in the range 3.45 to 3.65, and often, by their dark color. Normative composition (expressed in terms of theoretical constituent metal oxides), for HDC's is over 80% (wt.) Al2O3. HDC's are generally used only under conditions where the earth stresses are very high.

AB  - AbstractThis paper describes overbalanced perforating and surging operations as apretreatment to hydraulic fracturing for the Romeo interval at Prudhoe Bay.Operation conditions are presented and discussed, as well as surface andbottomhole pressure measurements. Well productivity and the amount of proppantplaced are compared to results in offset wells where the technique was notapplied.The paper shows how the use of the technique allows placement of small,highly conductive fractures in intervals that were not previously consideredfracturing candidates due to the close proximity to the gas/oil contact (GOC).The paper also shows pressure transient analysis affirming the technique as astand-alone stimulation. It is shown that the use of extreme overbalancedperforating and surging treatments prior to hydraulic fracturing produces asubstantial increase both in the success rate and the efficiency of thehydraulic fracturing operation and in the production rate of the wells that arepretreated.Finally, a comparison between pressure data and a new radial fracturepropagation model shows a good match. The model demonstrates that high-energytreatment can significantly increase the extension and the height of thefracture; this was corroborated by downhole pressure measurements recordedduring one overbalance treatment and by well logs.IntroductionIn 1990 an aggressive hydraulic fracture stimulation program began in thePrudhoe Bay Unit's Sadlerochit reservoir. This paper is limited to theARCO-operated portion of the field or the Eastern Operating Area (EOA). NorthSlope wells, like offshore wellbores, are drilled from a central location.These extended reach wells present difficulties for hydraulic fracturingoperations because of shear stresses associated with wellbores that do notalign with one of the principal in-situ stresses.The fracturing campaign was highly successful and has resulted in anincremental oil rate of 180,000 barrels of oil per day (BOPD) from 1990 through1993 - Two hundred thirty-three wells were hydraulically fractured in the EOA,with a comparable number fractured in the Western Operating Area (WOA). Theprimary hydraulic fracture stimulation zones are the Romeo and the Zulu. Ofthese EOA wells, 34% were stimulated in the Romeo formation, 56% in the Zuluformation. Even though the zones are in the same reservoir there aresignificant differences requiring different hydraulic stimulation approaches.This paper addresses the more difficult to fracture Romeo interval by firstdescribing the problem of Romeo formation fracturing followed by a discussionof the extreme overbalance (EOB) operations done at Prudhoe Bay. The impact ofthese pre-treatments is discussed on subsequent fracturing treatments and onthe well productivity. Several case histories are presented that furtherillustrate the technique. Stimulation benefit of stand-alone extremeoverbalanced perforating treatments is also investigated using bottomholepressure data. Finally, fracture propagation model predictions of surface andbottomhole pressure are compared with surface and bottomhole pressure recordedduring the EOB with fast-response pressure transducers.Formation Description. The Zulu is a clean sand several hundred feet thickencased between large shales. These thick shales adjacent to the Zulu allowlarge fractures to be placed without fracturing out of zone.On the other hand, the lower Romeo sands are less continuous, lesspermeable, finer grained, and are thin sand/shale sequences.

Abstract Gravel packs in cased perforated zones in unconsolidated sand formations often contribute to well impairment. Several of the important factors leading to the impairment are considered here. Techniques to minimize their influence are suggested. A mathematical model of gravel packed well productivity, which incorporated nondarcy flow through packed perforations, is developed. The model shows the importance of perforation size and density, as well as gravel size on well productivity in an idealized situation. Pertinent experimental data is presented for the pressure drop due to gravel filled perforations, for a range of flow rates likely to be encountered in actual operation. The model results generally show that larger perforations should be used for typical Gulf Coast gravel packs, for example, 3/4" or more instead of the commonly used 3/8 to 1/2 inch sizes. An experimental study illustrates packing in new zones which have not produced sand and which will not allow much gravel to be placed beyond the perforations. The effect of gravel placement conditions on pack respon to production shows that flow should be maintained through the perforations with certain specifications for flow rate and gravel concentration. The gravel pack in perforation tunnels responds poorly to production when gravel is placed at low flow rates or circulated into place with no perforation flow.

AB  - AbstractInjection of seawater through pipelines subject to corrosive conditions may lead to the introduction of dissolved and particulate iron which may cause formation damage and loss in injectivity.This study addresses the estimation of damage potential by a combination of modeling and laboratory testing. The specific goal of the proposed program is to create a database of acceptable iron contamination in injection water, and, injection rates for targeted reservoirs in Kuwait.Past studies show that iron concentration in injection water fluctuates due to seasonal temperature variations which control the corrosion rate inside pipelines.Conventional methods for quantifying formation damage due to seawater injection do not accurately reflect the processes occurring in the field, such as the variation of iron concentration with temperature.Traditional "rules-of-thumb" for predicting the lifespan and performance of injection wells ignore the contribution of temperature fluctuations on iron concentration in the injection water.This study proposes a procedure to estimate the potential and tolerance for formation damage in injection well systems due to uncontrolled introduction of iron and other particulate in the injection water.The proposed experiments include:study of the dry rock samples; study of reservoir brine and injected water; and, study of the fluid-rock interactions.Study of reservoir-rock utilizes routine core analyses to obtain the petrophysical parameters.SEM/ EDS are proposed as tools to characterize mineralogy and pore-morphology.Porosimitery is proposed for obtaining the pore size distributions and the mean hydraulic radius, MHR.Fluid Characterization involves the analysis and interaction of formation brine and the injection fluids.Knowledge of rock mineralogy and pore throat size distribution is expected to help in estimating the acceptable solid and iron concentration in the injected water.Characterization of rock-fluid interactions involves the injection of water with a range of solids and iron concentration in the reservoir cores to identify potential formation damage.IntroductionFormation Damage is defined as a reduction in permeability around a well bore. This reduction in permeability is the consequence of drilling, completion, injection, attempted stimulation or production of that well(1).Formation Damage can cause significant decreases in well productivity and loss in production equivalent to billions of dollars in lost revenues per year worldwide.One goal of this study is the identification and prediction of formation damage problems due to iron contamination during seawater injection into the reservoir.Iron particulates are suspended as fines in the seawater and are likely to cause blockage of pore throats in reservoir rocks.The potential for such formation damage problem may be identified using specialized laboratory equipment such as water analysis, routine core analysis, critical velocity analysis and SEM based pore and grain size Analysis.Fine particles present in the injection seawater and migrating clay fines, such as kaolinite, present in some rock matrices, are usually investigated for sources of fine migration(2).Formation damage due to iron contamination is one phenomenon that is usually not investigated in existing laboratory analyses for the source of formation damage.In Kuwait, seawater is used as one of the main sources of injection water(3).Iron particulates, which originate in long distance pipelines and transported through the potentially corrosive seawater needed for injection, are speculated to be the source of iron contamination that blocks pore throats in the formation.Seawater composition, by itself, is considered very corrosive to pipelines.However, there is another hidden factor that can cause iron contamination - the temperature variation due to seasonal change.The iron corrosion due to temperatures variations in injection water pipelines in Kuwait is well documented(4).

AB  - Since the global financial crisis of 2008, the global shipbuilding industry has changed considerably and placed major Korean shipbuilding companies (mostly common carrier builders) in a precarious position. Current competitiveness in the global shipbuilding industry has been attracted by low labor costs in China. The Korean shipbuilding industry, with heavy industry as the central figure, is attempting to increase its share of offshore plant construction to develop deep-sea resources. This highlights the most outdated part of offshore plant in Korea, the development technology, which includes front-end engineering development and deep-water floaters, unlike in more advanced companies in the United States, where development technology has advanced rapidly. This has prompted the Korean government to invest most of its R&D funds in the areas of product and equipment development. However, mega shipbuilders such as Samsung, Hyundai, and Daewoo have incurred considerable losses at construction stages because of major delays in production. By contrast, international engineering companies have supported development engineering. The considerable financial losses incurred by mega shipbuilders are believed to be caused by a lack of quality management with respect to the massive production quantities and complexities involved in outfitting topside structures. This study investigates a strategy to advance production management specialized for the offshore plant business and describes a robust and sustainable technical roadmap based on current information technologies (IT) and simulation-based management methods

AB  - Description The Command Activated Sandface Valve (CASFV) was developed to significantly improve productivity by enabling improved wellbore clean up, particularly in high angle and open-hole completions. Inefficient wellbore clean-up of highly deviated completions is common in production wells. Current solutions include smart well technology or time consuming clean up procedures that are both expensive and difficult to implement, leading to loss in well productivity, restricted access to reserves and in some cases a requirement to sidetrack the well. Challenge An operator in the UK had observed no flow from the toe of the well while experiencing high drawdown at the heel section due to the dominance of high productive intervals. This threatened the economics for the field development. The CASFV was then developed from the operator’s requirement for more control when selectively cleaning up/flowing the reservoir sections. The key objectives of the valve were to allow sequential clean up of the reservoir section from the toe to the heel without intervention or incremental rig time. The valve had to be remotely activated by a pressure recognition signal and also had to deliver the functionality of a sliding side door for future water shut-off capability along the well bore. Result Development of the valve was closely monitored by the operator which included a technical assurance review and failure mode and effects analysis process. The result is a successfully field proven completion tool that is the basis for a new completion technique for a more optimal production regime and increased oil recovery. The increased production and increased recovery from using this technology made the field development economically feasible. The Sandface Valve technology has now seen 75 valves installed with a functional 100% success rate.

AB  - SPE MembersAbstractThe adverse effects of inadequate fluid-loss control associated with gravel-packed completions is well known. Controlling fluid losses to the formation before and after pack placement is critical to ultimately achieving optimum productivity from a given well for the following two reasons:-Fluid-loss control is necessary to prevent losses of expensive high-density brines, sometimes used for well control in high-permeability, unconsolidated formations. The costly loss of expensive brines can also lead to critically unsafe well conditions, where high overbalance pressures are required to control highly geopressured zones.-Dense brines have been reported as being difficult to unload from formations once losses have occurred. Calcium and zinc-bromide brines can form highly stable, acid-insoluble compounds when reacted with some formation brines. Because of the high density of these brines, stratification tends to further inhibit their removal. The most effective means of preventing the formation damage described is to limit completion brine losses to the formation.IntroductionA variety of fluid-loss control materials have been used and evaluated, including foams, oil-soluble resins, acid-soluble particulates, graded salt slurries, linear viscoelastic polymers, and heavy metal-crosslinked polymers. Their comparative effectiveness is well documented. Most attain their fluid-loss control from the presence of solvent-specific solids, or from hydrated linear polymers that rely on filter-cake buildup and on viscoelasticity to inhibit flow into and through the formation.Oil-soluble resins generally clean up well when they are thoroughly contacted with solvent. Tests have shown, however, that such resin, lodged in perforation tunnels, may remain isolated from solvent for extremely long periods, thus restricting well production.Recent testing has shown that particulate systems, i.e., graded salt slurries, particularly those using polymers and gums for particle suspension, can be quite damaging to formations and difficult to remove from perforation tunnels. Himes et al. reported less than 10% regained permeability after treatments into a Berea core with a salt system containing graded salt in a xanthan gum base in a 10% NaCl solution.P. 743

AB  - ABSTRACTA feasibility study on the application of several kinds of rapid cure coating system to water ballast tank was conducted in terms of curing characteristics and coating performance. The coating systems employed in this study were three types of solvent free rapid cure epoxy coatings, an isocyanate curable polyurethane coating and a polyurea coating system. Polyurethane and polyurea coating were especially formulated for sea water ballast tank service. Based on the study of curing characteristics and coating performance of the polyurethane and polyurea coating system, it was found that lower adhesion strength of the coatings over power tool treated surface and lower surface profile was the result suggesting that additional primer application is needed in order to obtain required adhesion strength. Moreover corrosion resistance of the fast cure coatings especially in water immersion was inferior to that of the required epoxy coatings.INTRODUCTIONIn order to meet recent international rule and regulations, such as VOC regulations, 15 years target useful life of ballast tank; high solid, high performance coating systems are required. Furthermore shipyards are looking for ways to speed up the painting process or reduce the number of steps in a painting operation to improve productivity.In new shipbuilding industries, conventional solvent-born coatings require multi-coatings systems and longer curing period at low temperature season, which creates the needs for fast cure coatings to meet work schedule. The drying times of coating are affected to a significant degree by weather conditions. Delays due to unfavorable weather create subsequent delays in additional tasks, whether they are additional painting, structural repairs, or equipment installation.On the contrary to solvent borne epoxy coatings, isocyanate curable coatings can be sprayed a single coat system (a single application product with shorter production cycles). This will improve productivity with speed up the painting process and reduce the number of steps in a painting operation. Ultimately, this can lead to lower overall costs for the end-user. In coatings work, reducing the number of steps means using a single- or two-coat application of paint, rather than a multi-coat system; speeding up the process means achieving a fast cure and a rapid return to service1.The selected polyurea and polyurethane coatings system are newly developed and modified for WBT service and can cure quickly, at a wide range of temperatures in the presence of moisture. They can be sprayed to a desired thickness in a single application with plural component spray equipment. Several characteristics of these newly developed isocyanate curable coatings system are evaluated, such as drying time, adhesion, water immersion, condensation, salt spray, edge retention and cathodic disbondment in order to understand feasibility of the coatings for the application to the sea water immersion environment.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURE1. Coatings and specimen preparationSeveral epoxy and isocyanate curable coating systems were selected for evaluation with possible application for water ballast tank. For further performance test, specially designed urethane primer for polyurea coating system was applied because of its weak surface tolerance in wet condition.

AB  - SPE Members AbstractAchieving effective fracture lengths in carbonate formations by fracture acidizing has long been a recognized industry challenge. Severe fluid loss is generally considered a major factor limiting the effectiveness of acid fracturing treatments. A unique new acid fracturing fluid has been developed to control fluid loss. It has been tested in numerous laboratory and field studies. Test results confirm that this new fluid system improves live acid penetration in carbonate reservoirs by controlling acid fluid loss. This paper discusses the technical basis for the development of this new fluid system. Laboratory test' results are included. It also describes the results of field case histories in which the new system was successfully utilized in the Permian Basin of West Texas and the Williston Basin of North Dakota to control acid fluid loss in carbonate acid fracturing. Production comparisons show a substantial improvement in well performance from these wells following treatments that utilized this new system. IntroductionThe purpose of an acid fracturing treatment in a carbonate reservoir is to maximize well productivity. In order for the treatment to be successful, it must achieve effective fracture conductivity and effective fracture length. Fracture conductivity is easily obtained in most carbonates when HCl acid is used because of the acid's high reactivity. Achieving effective fracture length is usually much more difficult. There are two main problems associated with obtaining effective etched fracture lengths with acid fracturing: 1. At high bottomhole temperatures, etched fracture length is, to a large extent, reaction-rate limited. The acid spends very rapidly in the fracture near the wellbore, resulting in limited penetration of live acid and short, etched, fracture lengths. This problem requires some form of retardation of the reaction rate of the acid. There are several additives and acid systems available in the industry to obtain retardation, such as surfactant retarders and emulsified acids. P. 601^

AB  - Abstract Currently, there is an industry assortment of production analysis methods ranging from traditional decline and type curve matching to rate-pressure normalization techniques and detailed production history matching.   Yet despite its many limitations, conventional decline analysis is still commonly used in gas (and oil) production analysis due to its minimal data requirements and ease of application (regardless that without modification the method cannot be used to estimate reservoir properties or formation damage).   As a result, this paper presents an automated computer method for estimating original gas-in-place and other reservoir flow parameter for conventional and unconventional gas reservoirs. This procedure overcomes the limitations of convention decline in which the analyst must properly select the type of decline to avoid erroneous forecasts, as well as more exotic methods requiring iterative computational procedures. Onshore and offshore case studies and examples presented in this paper will demonstrate that a modified decline and production analysis procedure will allow for proper identification of flow regimes, reliable evaluation of drainage area and OGIP, and the prediction of future deliverability and depletion.  Case studies will also show that up-scaled and aggregate reservoir properties can provide a real measure of gas well deliverability and therefore a simpler, time-efficient model analysis can be used.  Data uncertainty, PVT error, stimulation appraisal, gas storage system (free or complex mechanisms such as absorbed gas) and other factors will be discussed in the context of the case studies, and general reservoir management. When used appropriately, the approach is generally accurate and robust enough that it can provide valuable information in circumstances of poor data quality.  Finally, the procedure is extremely simple and can be implemented in desktop applications or spreadsheets with minimal computational effort. Introduction Decline curve analysis has been used worldwide (particularly for single phase fluid flow) for forecasting future production from oil and gas fields since Arps [1945] formularized the technique during the 1940's.   Allegedly, the procedure can be applied to production data for any reservoir drive or mechanism, and has been shown to be suitable for both vertical and horizontal wells [Dou et al. 2009].  Fetkovich [1968] actually established guidelines about how decline curvature can indicate different reservoir systems.  However, despite its simplicity (and limitations of constant flowing pressure and fluid properties), analysts typically want more information without having to incur more time consuming and costly processes; for example, they are interested in reservoir permeability, formation damage (wellbore skin), and original fluid-in-place (OFIP) in addition to expected ultimate recovery (EUR) generated from conventional decline.    Furthermore, there is a desire to use the aforementioned information to generate production forecasts, and evaluate varying operating conditions such as compression.  As result, Fetkovich [1968] later proposed a substantial improvement in decline curve analysis by matching production data onto specialized type curves for reservoir characterization: the procedure (which is a powerful diagnostic tool), used the Arps depletion stems to analyze boundary dominated flow, and the van Everdingen and Hurst [1949] constant pressure type curves for transient production.  Al-Hussiany et al. [1966] later improved type curve analysis by addressing the effects of pressure dependant gas properties viscosity and supercompressibility through the use of pseudo-pressure, while Agarwal  [1979]  presented a pseudo-time function for incorporating pressure dependant properties gas viscosity and compressibility.

AB  - Abstract In traditional Digital Oilfield programs, it is assumed that increasing production from any given well has a positive impact on the operator&apos;s bottom-line.   In fact, optimum profitability for a field is dependent not just on production volume, but also on the individual contribution of each well to the overall profitability of the organization. Understanding the contribution of each well, and operating based on this knowledge, can provide significant benefits over and above traditional production optimization techniques.  Specifically, it can allow the field operations team to prioritize highest profitability wells - rather than just highest flow wells - and can even allow the identification of seemingly ‘productive&apos; wells which actually have an overall negative contribution to the organizations bottom line. To calculate well -by-well profitability, operators must not only be able to accurately measure/allocate production volume, but must also consider other factors such as water handling cost, ongoing maintenance cost , production sharing agreement impact, short and long-term pricing contracts, etc.   These and many other factors all contribute to the financial benefits accrued from a given well. Understanding the contribution of any well or group of to the profitability of an operator is therefore more complex than simply calculating the production flow for the day and multiplying by the prevailing price for WTI or Brent. The data necessary to calculate well-by-well contribution is spread across many siloed systems, including production, maintenance and financial applications.  At best, operators review production volumes monthly to produce revenue figures when some sort of contribution figure may be possible to calculate.  However it rare for any operator to manage cost information at the resolution necessary to calculate P&L accurately, so there has not been the ability to manage daily operations based on well-by-well profitability.  Instead, operators have typically calculated a broad ‘field lifting cost&apos; and applied this across wells. Clearly, with the high-well counts and heterogeneous production fields that are increasingly common, the potential value to manage wells on a full fiscal calculation rather than just cost can offer significant benefits.

AB  - U.S. shipbuilding productivity is significantly less than that of Japan and some European countries. The traditional view has either minimized the importance of the difference in productivity between U.S. and the best foreign shipyards, or focused on the lack of opportunities for U.S. yards to build in long series. As a result of research since 1977—much of it conducted under the auspices of the Maritime Administration National Shipbuilding Research Program—a new view of the productivity difference has developed. Several studies have established that the productivity difference is very large. A number of studies have related this difference to new methods and systems of shipbuilding developed abroad. Based on a review of the literature, this study describes these methods and systems and examines obstacles to their adoption in the United States. Implications for public policy are discussed. Some current efforts of U.S. shipbuilders to improve productivity and Maritime Administration and Navy programs of technology promotion are referenced.

AB  - Summary This paper presents a new numerical model of inflow to a well with a zone of damaged permeability. It is built on the principle of dividing the wellbore and damaged permeability zone into numerous segments. Simultaneous work of the segments is modeled with the method of velocity-potential theory. The model is applicable for wellbores of different trajectories including horizontal and multilateral wells. The model is focused on the extended application of results obtained during laboratory core testing that include a return-permeability (RP) profile of the core and cleanup parameters. The developed solution includes the effects of anisotropy, reservoir-boundary conditions, and a nonuniform distribution of formation damage in both radial and axial directions. The paper presents the new approach to include depth-variable distribution of damage in skin-factor models. The approach provides for the evaluation of pressure drop in a depth-variable damage zone by the resulting permeability that is defined by flow regime. Laboratory-obtained overall core permeability is associated with a linear flow, and when applied to a zone near the wellbore with radial or elliptic flow, it causes an error because of the depth-variable distribution of damage. The provided numerical simulations show that the impact of this factor on horizontal-well productivity is significant. The developed model is compared with existing analytical solutions of Furui et al. (2002) (FZH) and Frick and Economides (1993) (FE) for the case of a horizontal well with a cone-shaped damaged zone. The results show that a skin-factor transformation originally proposed by Renard and Dupuy (1991) for a case of a uniformly damaged well can be used successfully for the referred-to analytical solutions, which makes them applicable for wells with an elliptic drainage area. In this paper, we also suggest an approach whereby we relate the characteristics of the cleanup of the region near the wellbore to laboratory-testing conditions.

AB  - Abstract The validity and sensitivity of using a fracture geometry model in combination with a finite difference reservoir simulator for the analysis of fractured gas well productivity are examined in this paper. The validity of combining the Khristianovich-Zheltov fracture growth model with a single phase, gas reservoir simulator is established by comparing field data in low, moderate, and high permeability gas reservoirs with calculations. It is shown that all aspects of well behavior including drawdown, buildup, production flowmeter, core data, and finite reservoir size can be quantitatively modeled. The sensitivity, or uniqueness, of the fit to field data is demonstrated by computer-generated studies of a typical 2-dimensional-acting gas well, and by a similar analysis applied to one of the field data sets. The paper contains a complete set of data for four wells that were fractured with eight fracture treatments. The data are in a form that can be readily used by anyone wishing to apply an alternative analysis. It is concluded from the evaluations in this paper that a 2-dimensional fracture shape model is adequate to quantitatively describe fracture dimensions for use in either long-term well productivity extrapolations or in optimal fracture treatment design. Introduction The modeling of hydraulic fracture growth has been pursued for at least the last 30 years by many investigators. The ultimate goal has always been the development of a quantitatively correct model so that one can accurately select the optimal fracture treatment and closely estimate long-term well recovery. Several fixed-height (2-dimensional) shape models have been developed and extensively discussed in the literature, in terms of their underlying assumptions and adequacy to describe real fracture growth behavior. Recently several 3-dimensional models have been developed with potential for increasing the accuracy with which fracture growth can be modeled. Arguments abound in the literature on specific technical details of one model with respect to another, and workers in the field are not in agreement that any one model is best for general use. If one model were universally agreed to be appropriate, everyone would use it to design an economically optimal treatment and to estimate future well recovery for planning purposes. This paper will show that one fixed-height model fulfills most of the needs if fracture height is known or can be reasonably estimated. It will be shown that the Khristianovich-Zheltov, K-Z, model seems to estimate fracture shape with sufficient accuracy that all of the well's production behavior can be closely modeled. Selection of the K-Z model was based on practical engineering considerations rather than on technical details. The rectangular cross-section of the K-Z model is most easily adaptable to proppant transport modeling and is as good as any shape at modeling the effective cross-sectional shape of the complex, irregular-width fractures that are observed under field conditions. Gas wells were exclusively studied in this paper because gas reservoirs have a well-defined drive mechanism (gas expansion) that will minimize the potential for misinterpretation of drive effects as fracture shape effects. It is reasoned that if a fracture shape model can be verified in gas reservoirs, it should also be valid in oil reservoirs since the fracture treatment itself is little affected by in situ reservoir fluids.

AB  - In this paper, first, using production data from more than 40 wells with 5 years or more history and from a number of shale plays, we demonstrate the serious short comings of commonly used decline curves. Besides a critical evaluation of various regression methods used in decline analysis, we demonstrate forecasting scenarios using flow modeling approaches that can best honor the responses from hydraulically fractured wells. Our study focused on bench mark modeling relating the changes in production decline focusing on the integrity of the fracture network system. We modeled and analyzed the negative impact of fracture closure caused by proppant embedment or proppant crushing. We also examined various physics including fracture closing and boundary effects associated with the rate of decline observed after the initial flow period and were able to detect reservoir heterogeneity effects including fracture quality and well productivities. We used monthly production data from wells with long history producing from Marcellus, Eagle ford, Barnett, Bakken & North Shafter reservoirs. We concluded that decline curves do not honor the physics of flow and may result in erroneous estimates of EUR. However the same production histories examined based on the modeling of flow regimes and fractures closing are quite diagnostic. Further we did bench mark studies using simulation modeling on the anticipated responses and ruled out the applicability of desorption in most case, as some use, to explain the constant production from unconventional reservoirs. Case studies for 40 wells are included to demonstrate the application of our bench mark modeling work .

AB  - SummaryFluid-loss additives are frequently used in completion fluids and pills to reduce fluid costs and formation damage, but many of these additives create more damage than they prevent. Common recommendations are to use fluid-loss additives that will be dissolved by the produced fluids, acid, or water so that they may be readily removed after a job. Typical additives are oil-soluble resins, calcium carbonate particles, and salt suspensions.It is particularly important that soluble additives be used for wells that are to be gravel packed because the gravel will trap insoluble solids in the well. Evidence indicates, however, that even these soluble products remain in perforation tunnels and impair productivities of wells. Examples of wells indicating this effect during post-gravel-pack acid treatments are discussed. The theory of why this occurs and calculations of pressure drops through perforations filled with fluid-loss additives are presented.It has also been found that excess fluid-loss additives prevent complete coverage of a zone with gravel, because of either inadequate leakoff to the formation or partial plugging of the screen. Therefore, it is imperative that these additives be removed by acid, water, or solvents preceding the gravel slurry; however, if their removal causes loss of circulation, the results may be equally bad.The most practical solution to this problem is to use a combination of gravel and viscous fluids as a diverting system for the fluids that will remove the additives without creating additional formation damage. When this system is used just ahead of a gravel slurry, it not only helps remove the fluid-loss additives, but also helps prevent excessive fluid losses and partially prepacks the formation with gravel.IntroductionControlling the fluid-loss rate before, during, and after placement of a gravel pack is extremely important. Excessive fluid-loss rates are common in weak or unconsolidated sandstones because these formations are often very permeable, but fluids lost to the formation cause formation damage, increase the costs of completions, hinder complete zone coverage by gravel packs, and may lead to blowouts.The use of high-viscosity-gel pills to reduce fluid-loss rates should cause only minor formation damage, but in many wells these pills are ineffective and soluble fluid-loss additives must be added to them. The combination of solids and gelled fluids will effectively control fluid loss in most wells.Soluble fluid-loss additives may be grouped into three categories: oil soluble (resins and waxes), acid soluble (calcium carbonate and iron carbonate), and water soluble (salts). The most commonly used fluid-loss additives are calcium carbonate particles that are soluble in acid, and oil-soluble resin dispersions that are soluble in most crude oils. A dispersion of salt in saturated brine that can be removed by undersaturated brine or water is also used.These soluble fluid-loss additives have been shown to be effective in the laboratory and the field; some laboratory tests indicate, however, that they all result in residual formation damage.1,2 In laboratory tests by King and Hollingsworth,1 the fluid-loss additives invaded the sandpacks enough to cause residual reduction of permeabilities ranging from 8 to 26%, even after the filter cake and the first 0.25 in. [0.635 cm] of the sandpacks were removed. If gravel had been packed in these test cells, some of the filter cake and most of the additives in the first 0.25 in. [0.635 cm] of the sandpacks would have been trapped in place, thus causing more severe formation damage.The following discussions will concentrate on calcium carbonate, but it should be recognized that similar problems are associated with all soluble fluid-loss additives used in gravel-packed wells.Productivity Problems Created by Incomplete Removal of Fluid-Loss AdditivesCalcium carbonate controls fluid loss by three mechanisms: (1) invasion of formation pores, (2) bridging at the entrance to the formation to form a filter cake, and (3) filling of perforation tunnels. Fine grinds (5 and 50 µm) are very effective because they invade into the pores of a wide variety of permeable formations and cause "in-depth" plugging. They also form very-low-permeability filter cakes at the face of the formation and very-low-permeability packs as they fill perforation tunnels. Larger grinds (150 and 600 µm) do not readily invade into the pores of most sandstones but form filter cakes with relatively high permeabilities. Thus, the smaller grinds should control fluid loss more effectively than the larger grinds but potentially cause more formation damage because they will be more difficult to remove.The importance of using the proper particle-size distribution of calcium carbonate has been discussed previously.3,4 Generally, a wide distribution of particles is required to form bridges on the various pore sizes encountered in typical wells; however, larger grinds are needed for formations with larger pores (higher-permeability sands), and smaller grinds for formations with smaller pores (lower-permeability sands).Typical particle-size distributions of common commercial calcium carbonate additives3 are shown in Figs. 1 through 4. Theoretically, if this 5-µm grind is used for a formation that has an average pore size of 50 µm or more, most of the calcium carbonate particles will invade into this formation and will not effectively reduce the fluid-loss rate unless a high concentration or large volume of particles is used. The 50-µm grind has adequate particle-size distribution to bridge near the entrance to this formation sand and to fill the perforation tunnels to restrict fluid loss effectively. If the 150- or 600-µm grinds are used, few of the particles can invade into this formation, but the higher-permeability filter cake formed by these larger particles will be less effective in reducing fluid losses.Field experience indicates that the 5-µm grind effectively controls fluid loss in formations with measured average pore sizes greater than 100 µm. This may occur because the formation was damaged by the drilling operations or muds that reduce the average pore sizes of the formation. Current completion practices of underbalanced perforating, or perforation surging, should remove some of this damage, thus increasing the pore sizes exposed to the calcium carbonate particles and the invasion of particles from pills used after perforating.

AB  - Abstract This paper describes the development of a highly automated apparatus and customized software package to rapidly evaluate the performance of surfactant additives in dry gas shale reservoirs. A major challenge throughout the industry is the ability to reduce water saturation resulting from fluid leakoff into the formation matrix during stimulation operations. The new method presented in this paper to help identify the optimum surfactant for reducing post-treatment water saturation based on well-specific parameters. Conventional laboratory evaluation of stimulation fluid additives typically involves coreflow studies, which are excessively time consuming and have poor reproducibility as a result of core-to-core inconsistencies. The focus of this endeavor was to develop a statistically relevant method that can use drill cuttings samples and measures surfactant additive performance data with high confidence and reproducibility for the tested formation material. Data analysis included analysis of variance (ANOVA) followed by post-hoc Tukey honest significant difference (HSD) range testing. Test apparatus results were also corroborated with coreflow studies. Eight surfactant additives were evaluated in the presence of four different fracture fluid formulations and formation samples. For each surfactant/fracturing fluid/formation test matrix, the software was able to rank surfactants performance based on the volume of fracturing fluid displaced from a column pack normalized to the pressure gradient. No individual surfactant performed best more than 40% of the time within this test series, and the surfactant-laden formulations always statistically outperformed the nonsurfactant control. The results imply that the addition of surfactants results in increased treatment fluid load recovery. Reservoir simulations were performed to investigate the effects of increased load recovery and depth of invasion of fracturing fluids on hydrocarbon production. The simulation results confirmed the assumption that minimal invasion of treatment fluid into the matrix of the formation resulting from increased load recovery does improve hydrocarbon production. The simulation data also suggest this observed hydrocarbon production improvement is particularly prevalent in the early time/cleanup period of the life of the well. A key feature and novelty of the apparatus is the ability to evaluate numerous surfactants in series and the potential to perform up to 24 individual tests in an 8-hour shift. The results presented in this paper showcase the utility of the newly developed apparatus, which offers a new method for rapid customization of stimulation fluids.

AB  - Abstract Controlling fluid matrix leakoff into the formation is of critical importance during fracture stimulation treatments to ensure objectives are met. Decreasing the amount of fluid leakoff increases the volume that is available to maintain and propagate a hydraulic fracture. The need to minimize fluid leakoff is even more significant during acid fracturing since maintaining the fracture is difficult because of the ability of acid to spend quickly as it enters the formation. Traditional approaches utilize solids-laden viscous gels to reduce the volume of fluid leakoff as a fracture is propagated; however, it has been amply documented that the solids typically used are capable of damaging the formation if not properly removed after the treatment. Moreover, removal of treatment gels, which is required to minimize formation damage, is contingent on selection and design of breakers or other compounds, which are often chosen based on a number of uncertain reservoir parameters. This paper will present both laboratory and field application results from a new solids-free fluid loss (SFFL) system designed to reduce matrix permeability to aqueous fluids, thereby resulting in longer fracture propagation caused by a significantly lower fluid-leakoff rate. This fluid loss system does not require the use of breakers, which eliminates the potential negative impact on post-stimulation well productivity. Laboratory test data will show the ability of the material to control fluid leakoff and its ability to achieve high levels of regained permeability to hydrocarbon. Field results from the application of the new system during acid fracturing treatments in high condensate gas producers in Saudi Arabia, in which achieving long half-length fractures with acid is very difficult due to excessive fluid leakoff, are also discussed. Post-treatment analysis showed that utilization of the new system resulted in significant reduction of fluid leakoff, thereby allowing treating pressure to remain above closure pressure throughout the treatment and achieve a longer fracture extension. A post treatment performance comparison between gas producers treated with the new system and those stimulated using conventional fluids will show that using the new system consistently exhibited better productionperformance (normalized for reservoir characteristics). Introduction During fracture acidizing stimulation treatments, acid is injected into a created fracture to etch the fracture walls and increase post-frac conductivity to the wellbore. Subsequently, a large portion of the acid usually leaks off into the matrix during the operation, and in some cases leakoff rates increase throughout a fracture acidizing treatment. The enhanced fluid leakoff occurs through natural hairline fractures or through the wormholes that are created in the fracture walls, and it is the main limiting factor in creating the desired net pressure and fracture geometry. The importance of controlling leakoff is often overlooked, and in many cases little or no effort is made to effectively control it. The reduction in injection pressure, which is often observed during acid fracture treatments, may be interpreted as a sign of a successful job, when, in fact, if may be an indication of increasing leakoff. If the leakoff is too large, the fracture length will usually be less than required and result in lower well productivity.

AB  - Summary Streamline-based methods, as repeatedly demonstrated in multiple applications, offer a robust and elegant framework for reconciling high-resolution geologic models with observed field responses. However, significant challenges persist with the application of streamline-based methods in complex grids and dual-permeability media due to the difficulty with streamline tracing in these systems. In this work, we propose a novel and efficient framework that circumvents these challenges by avoiding explicit tracing of streamlines but exploits the inherent desirable features of streamline-based production data integration in high-resolution geologic models. Our approach features the application of flow diagnostics to inverse problems involving the integration of multiphase production data in reservoir models. Here, time-of-flight as well as numerical tracer concentrations for each well, on the basis of a defined flux field, are computed on the native finite-volume grid. The information embedded in these metrics are used in the dynamic definition of stream-bundles and, eventually, in the computation of analytical water arrival-time sensitivities with respect to model properties. This calculation mimics the streamline-derived analytical sensitivity computation used in the well-established generalized travel-time inversion (GTTI) technique but precludes explicit streamline tracing. The reservoir model property field is updated iteratively by solving the LSQR (sparse least-squares with QR factorization) system composed of the computed analytical sensitivity and the optimal water travel-time shift, augmented with regularization and smoothness constraints. The power and efficacy of our approach are demonstrated using synthetic model and field applications. We first validate our approach by benchmarking with the streamline-based GTTI algorithm involving a single-permeability medium. The flow-diagnostics-derived analytical sensitivities were observed to show good agreement with the streamline-derived sensitivities in terms of correctly capturing relevant spatiotemporal trends. Furthermore, the desirable quasilinear behavior characteristic of the traditional streamline-based GTTI technique was preserved. The flow-diagnostics-based inversion technique is then applied to a field-scale problem involving the integration of multiphase production data into a dual-permeability model of a large naturally fractured reservoir. The results clearly demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach in overcoming the limitations of classical streamline-based methods with dual-permeability systems. By construction, this approach finds direct application in single/multicontinuum models with generic grid designs, both in structured and fully unstructured formats, thereby aiding well-level history matching and high-resolution updates of modern geologic models. This work presents, for the first time, an application of the GTTI to dual-permeability models of naturally fractured reservoirs. This is facilitated by a simplified, yet effective approach to travel-time sensitivity computations directly on finite-volume grids. The proposed approach can be easily applied to subsurface models at levels of complexity identified as challenging for classical streamline-based methods.

AB  - SummaryWater blocking caused by invasion of completion fluids has been suspected to reduce gas well deliverability.1-5 However, this effect has not been quantified. We report results of a laboratory program to measure the water-blocking effect in core samples from a gas field. These data were mapped to a wellbore model to make deliverability predictions.The laboratory data consist of gas flow rate as a function of injected gas pore volume for various liquids (brine, methanol, toluene, isopropyl alcohol, and brine-methanol mixtures) at two saturation states (fully saturated with liquid, and containing liquid and trapped gas). We injected over 10,000 PV of gas in each test to mimic near-wellbore conditions. The data showed that the liquid displacement regime was followed by a mass transfer regime.The wellbore model had a time varying skin to account for the cleanup of the fluid invaded ("water-blocked") region. Cleanup occurs as gas flows past this high liquid-saturated region and removes liquid by displacement and mass transfer. We used the laboratory data to relate the reduced permeability of this region to pore volumes of gas throughput.We find that any loss in gas well deliverability recovers in two phases. The first phase corresponds to fluid displacement ("flowback period") and lasts for a few days at most. The second phase is slower and can last several months. Here, evaporation causes the deliverability to slowly increase. It is in this regime that adding volatile fluids, such as methanol, to the completion brines has advantages.IntroductionPoor gas flow performance following well operations such as completions and workovers was recently observed in some wells in a gas field. Loss of aqueous fluids during these operations causes a ring of high water saturation around the wellbore. This can potentially reduce gas flow into the well, and this phenomenon is called "water blocking." The objectives of our work were to assess the impact of water blocking on well deliverability and to evaluate remediation possibilities.Water blocking has been suspected to reduce deliverability of gas reservoirs.1-5 Bennion et al.1 and Cimolai et al.2 assert that water blocking is a problem in which the in-situ water saturation is significantly less than "irreducible" water saturation. They present two field case studies to advocate their claims. The first case study is on the Paddy formation in Central Alberta [k~100 md; f=15%; Sw (in situ)=17%; Swirr (lab) = 43%]. The second is on the Cadomin formation in Alberta [k~1 md; f=5%; Sw (in situ)=20%; Swirr(lab)=52%]. Metheven3 discusses the performance of gas wells in the Frio and Wilcox formations in Texas. His data show that oil-based drilling fluids lead to significant improvements in gas productivity compared to water-based muds or invert emulsions. Laboratory tests indicate return permeability to gas after exposure to muds to be higher for oil-based mud than for water-based mud. Metheven suggests water blocking and vaporization of oil base filtrate by gas production as reasons for these differences at the laboratory as well as field scale. Holditch4 presents a numerical study of formation damage around a hydraulic fracture in a tight gas sand reservoir. He makes an interesting observation that formation damage can increase the capillary pressure of a rock and that this synergetic effect could lead to waterblock problems. Abrams and Vinegar5 use Computed Tomography to image the flow of nitrogen and brine in microdarcy gas sand cores. They claim that water block is unimportant if the drawdown pressure gradient in the region near a hydraulic fracture is on the order of several hundred psi/in. Stimulation using alcohol or surfactants did not significantly improve gas flow in these cores. On the other hand, MacLeod6 claims aqueous stimulation fluids containing alcohol have proven to be highly successful in stimulating gas production from problem wells in sandstone formations.The published literature does not contain a systematic set of laboratory measurements using different fluids and saturation states. There are no data on corefloods exposed to the large pore volumes of gas flow as would be expected in the near-wellbore environment. Also, laboratory data have never been mapped to a wellbore model to evaluate whether the effects seen in the laboratory are important in reducing well deliverability. Our study attempts to address some of these shortcomings.ApproachOur approach consists of the following steps:Laboratory gas floods are conducted at ambient conditions to generate Krg vs. PVgas data.The Krg-PVgas curves for reservoir conditions are computed from the laboratory data.A well flow model with a time varying skin to represent the water-blocking region is developed. The permeability of this skin changes as gas flows past it, and is given by the Krg-PVgas curves.Well deliverability calculations are made for different conditions.Laboratory Gas FloodsWe conducted laboratory experiments on a preserved, composite (three plugs) sandstone sample with the following properties: f=16%, k=14 md, Swi=28%, L=16 cm, PV=30 ml. The experiments consisted of a series of room-condition, constant pressure- drop humidified methane floods of the core sample containing various liquids (brine, methanol, toluene, isopropyl alcohol, and brine-methanol mixtures) at two saturation states: fully saturated with liquid, and containing liquid and trapped gas. Brine represents the primary fluid in the water-block region; brinemethanol mixtures represent liquids used for remediation; methanol, toluene, and isopropyl alcohol are used as model liquids to help interpret the data. The saturation states represent the potential conditions in the near-wellbore environment. We present only selected aspects of the laboratory work in this paper, and the laboratory data and analyses are discussed in detail in Ref. 7. We also note that toluene was used as a model solvent to validate laboratory data and has no practical significance. Isopropyl alcohol was used as it has been used for stimulation purposes,6 and it provides a reference value for another potential remediation fluid.

AB  - Abstract Subsurface geomechanical changes can cause severe damage to oil and gas well casing strings and cement barriers, which can compromise the zonal isolation of either an abandoned or active well, in the latter case jeopardizing its productive life. A novel system was developed based on laboratory experiments to simultaneously monitor casing deformation and cement integrity using fiber optic distributed temperature and strain sensing (DTSS). The proposed system consists of a hybrid-Brillouin-Rayleigh-based DTSS technique used in combination with two dedicated fiber optic cables. The first is a standard telecommunication fiber, which is used to measure strain changes due to casing deformation. The second cable, coated with a hydrocarbon-sensitive polymer, detects an additional strain caused by the presence of hydrocarbons due to a loss of zonal isolation. The combined system can also detect temperature changes caused by formation fluid invasion from a lower depth into the cement annulus. Since the two cables will be installed side-by-side on the outside of a casing string within the cement sheath, the system can also be used for monitoring the quality of a cementing job. The proposed system provides continuous, real-time and in-situ monitoring of casing deformation and cement integrity to prevent substantial impact on production, or to detect plug failure and hydrocarbon leakage for abandoned and decommissioned wells. It can thereby provide detailed information (i.e. location, type, and event severity) to plan and execute remedial operations, if necessary.

AB  - Abstract:Construction strategies that minimize congestion and disruption to local communities are becoming more common. These rapid renewal strategies involve extended work shifts, nighttime work and work zones adjacent to active roadways. Since rapid renewal will likely add to occupational fatigue on highway construction sites, managers must understand occupational fatigue to successfully deliver projects with minimal injuries.This article reviews characteristics that con- tribute to cognitive and localized muscular fatigue, methods to measure and control fatigue and its effects on safe work behavior and quality of life. A model of fatigue management is offered as well.

AB  - Before we can talk about managing productivity, we ought to properly define it. The generic definition of productivity is output divided by input -- it is the relationship between an organization's outputs and the inputs utilized to produce those outputs. Improving productivity simply means getting more out of what you put in. Now, while t h a t is a nice straightforward definition , it is inadequate for most organizations. It does not address the quality issue, for example, and it is of little meaning to an organization whose outputs are intangible, such as an engineering department. One of the first tasks of a productivity manager, therefore, is to develop a definition t h a t is meaningful to the organization. Too often managers perceive that productivity applies only to the labor input and sometimes, even more narrowly, only to the hourly worker. In fact, productivity applies t o all of the inputs that are utilized in the productive process. The productivity of capital, materials, or energy may have even greater impact on the bottom line than does the productivity of labor. If we look at the trend of labor productivity growth in this country, we note that the U. S. achieved a regular average annual growth rate in labor productivity of 3.2 percent per year for about 20 years after the close of World War 11. Beginning in the mid-sixties, however, that growth rate began to decline. From 1965 to 1973 the annual growth rate averaged less than 2-112 percent, and from 1973 to 1979, less than one percent. It bottomed out in 1979 and 1980, when outright declines in labor productivity occurred. This was the first time in recent history that the U. S. had experienced a consecutive two-year decline in labor productivity. While growth rates have accelerated again in the early 1980's, for the most part they have not returned to the r a t e s achieved in the early post-war period. In fact , another decline occurred in the third quarter of 1984. When we examine the growth rates of other developed nations, we see that the U. S. has been dead last in labor productivity growth from the mid-sixties to the present, averaging only about one percent per year. Not surprisingly, the Japanese have led in productivity growth during this period, averaging a 5.5 percent increase per year. Even countries that have had well-publicized economic problems, such as the United Kingdom and Italy , have increased their productivity at a more rapid rate than has the United States. When we look a t absolute l e v e l s of labor productivity, however, we see t h a t the United S t a t e s is still number one, with West Germany, France, and Canada close behind. The Japanese economy is only about 75 percent as productive as is the U. S., although in manufacturing, the Japanese are almost even.

AB  - Abstract Surface degradation in oil well tubings due to sliding contact against sucker rod couplings leads to component damage, decrease productivity by leakage and ultimately failure. Despite the detrimental effect of combined mechanical wear with CO2 corrosion has been known for long time, it is seldom considered when selecting and screening tubing materials. The present work proposes an experimental procedure for characterizing the sliding - CO2 corrosion behavior of low carbon steel tubings. Our approach provides a fast and reliable procedure to screen prospective tubing materials. The feasibility of the test rig to reproduce surface degradation under field conditions is illustrated by comparing two J55 tubing grades with different hardness and chromium content. The performance of the tubings is discussed by comparing the results of pure sliding, static corrosion and sliding - CO2 corrosion tests. The results show the damage interaction between mechanical wear and corrosion, thus highlighting their synergy. The role of mechanical properties and chromium content are discussed within this context and the damage mechanisms observed with our experimental simulation test rig are compared to those observed under real field applications.

Abstract The discovery and six appraisal wells drilled in the Piper field provided data for the formulation of a flexible development plan which will permit rapid field evaluation. plan which will permit rapid field evaluation. The development plan will be modified as additional data are obtained so that the optimum development and operational plans can be used to obtain the maximum economic recovery from the field. Introduction The Piper field was discovered in December, 1972, and presented a classic example of the offshore oil industry's need to 1) make the decision to commit large sums of money toward development of a discovery at a very early stage of appraisal and 2) formulate development and operating plans rapidly in a situation of uncertainty regarding important natural features of the reservoir and its connected aquifer. Preliminary studies on hypothetical fields of Piper size and water depth completed prior to the commencement of drilling permitted the Occidental group to begin an aggressive materials procurement and design programme immediately procurement and design programme immediately after the discovery well was drilled. Geological and engineering data obtained during the appraisal drilling provided information for rapid screening of possible oil displacement programmes and the selection of the general programmes and the selection of the general injection and producing well arrangement; a mathematical reservoir simulator was then used to devise a flexible development plan which will permit adjustments in well location and type (injection or production) as dictated by information gained early in the development/ producing phase. In particular, the development producing phase. In particular, the development plan should permit early determination of plan should permit early determination of the degree to which the field faults will act as impediments to fluid flow, and the strength of the natural water influx. The development programme based on these studies includes a drilling/production platform which will accommodate a total of platform which will accommodate a total of 36 wells with plans for at least 24 producing wells and up to 10 water and 2 gas injection wells. Platform production and support facilities were designed for 250,000 B/D of oil production, 330,000 B/D of water injection, and 70 million SCF/D of gas injection. The platform will have two drilling rigs and will platform will have two drilling rigs and will incorporate safety features which will permit simultaneous drilling and production.

AB  - Several new procedures for completing oil wells have been developed inrecent years. Each method when used where properly applicable promises to be adefinite aid to operators in lowering development or operating costs, or indeveloping the full potentialities of the oil well. Multiple-zone completionsare now frequently used, in contrast to the older practice of setting a solidwater string over each zone to be produced. Gravel packing in unconsolidatedformations often prevents sand troubles formerly experienced where aconventional perforated liner was used. Light-weight bentonitic clay muds andoil-base drilling fluids are definite steps toward eliminating mudding damage,which occurs when heavy rotary mud is used.Since in each case the new procedure developed is an alternate of olderconventional methods, a problem of selection is presented. The purpose of thispaper is to suggest methods of arriving at these choices and to presentpractical observations that may be of aid in their application.IntroductionDiscovery of deep and prolific oil-producing zones in the San Joaquin Valleyof California during the years 1936, 1937 and 1938 directed attention to meansof improving rates of penetration in drilling. In these years rapid advanceswere made in hole-making technique, and as a result the investment required fordeep development projects was substantially reduced. Improvements introducedduring this period included: (I) larger drilling machinery, with fasterhoisting speeds, higher rotary speeds, and larger circulation volumes; (2)better mud control; and (3) increased use of alloy steels. This increasedefficiency of operation has been maintained but further improvement in deepdrilling practice has been less marked in the years 1939, 1940 and 1941. Thediscovery and intensive development of the Wilmington field, in the Los AngelesBasin, which reached its peak in 1938, was influential in shifting the emphasisfrom hole making to completion procedure. Since 1938, California operators havedevoted an increased amount of study to programs for drilling in and completingwells. This new emphasis on completion procedure has, led to the development oftechniques that represent the first successful departures from conventionalmethods to be introduced in many years.T.P. 1465

AB  - Abstract This paper describes workover and completion operations offshore Trinidad & Tobago and the Gulf of Mexico in which the operator desired non-mechanical isolation of the reservoir section above the sand-control assembly.  Each well required clear brine of kill-weight density and in the case of the five dry gas wells described, losses of significant volume of brine to the formation was unacceptable.  Isolation of the reservoir was required for up to 18 days.  The following objectives were specified: Reduce fluid losses to the formation from inside the sand control screen, Minimize the potential for formation or screen damage, and Eliminate post-job, clean-up treatment of any kind. This paper describes the development of specially formulated fluid-loss control pills and their subsequent use in the field to provide reservoir isolation by placing a temporary filter cake on the inside surface of the sand control screen.  The paper describes laboratory tests designed to optimize the pill formulation to seal the inside surface of each specific screen, minimize spurt loss, maintain rheological properties for an extended period at reservoir condition and, importantly, displace off the screen with gas production.  In each of the cases described, field spotting procedures were designed to eliminate killing the wells by bullheading, thus significantly reducing the volume of fluid lost to the reservoir.  The authors provide details of the properties of the pill and the field procedures used to place the pills in the wells.  All wells were returned to production without any remedial treatment whatsoever or impact on productivity.  Additionally, the savings in time, costs and lessons learned associated with these projects and recommendations for similar future projects are discussed. Introduction An operator working offshore Trinidad & Tobago planned to replace the production tubing in five dry gas producers.  These wells were completed as deviated 8.5-in. open hole in which a 7-in. pre-perforated liner was run.  Two different types of sand screens were run inside the 7-in. liner and gravel packed with 40/60 gravel (US mesh).  Increased production targets initiated the workovers in which the combination 5.5 x 4.5-in. carbon steel production tubing on five of the eight platform wells would be replaced with a combination of 7 x 5.5-in. 13-Chrome production tubing.  This task also included the setting of packers above the current production packer in the wellbore.  Each re-completion had a planned duration of 18 days.  For several reasons, including the expected increased rate of dry gas production,  it was very desirable to limit losses to the formation and to isolate the sand control section during the workover, however, only chemical means of fluid-loss control were practical.  The operator was concerned about losing large amounts of completion brine to the depleted sands and even more concerned about plugging the completion with immobile solids since a remedial treatment would put the operation well past schedule for returning the wells to  production and put the project over budget.  To achieve these objectives, the operator, its operating partner, and the completion fluid service company considered whether it was possible to formulate a fluid-loss-control pill (FLCP) that would temporarily seal the inside surface of the premium screens with minimal matrix invasion, hold kill-weight pressure for the duration of the operation and not require any remedial treatment.

AB  - AbstractIn deep-well, high-permeability completions, effective control of loss of expensive, brine completion fluid is a major challenge. High bottomhole temperature, differential pressure, and brine acidity may limit the reliability of conventional fluid-loss control agents that are available for less severe conditions. Gel pills generally cannot control high-density brines because it is difficult to generate a stable gel pill in a high fluid-density environment, thereby complicating placement efficiency. Particulate-type systems may also be undesirable because of cleanup concerns.This paper describes the codevelopment and field application of a nonparticulate, high-density fluid-loss control material consisting of derivatized hydroxyethylcellulose (DHEC) and an enhanced external breaker system. Development of the product was critical to the successful completion of the first-ever, three- phase, triple-stacked subsalt completion in the Gulf of Mexico (GOM). DHEC provides an effective method of controlling high-density brine loss during deep-well, high-permeability completions, with minimal formation damage. Within a certain temperature range, DHEC is stable in zinc bromide (ZnBr2) brines for extended periods. The enhanced acid breaker system allows the user to achieve rapid breaking of DHEC on demand. The paper also discusses the principles underlying the design and development of the material and the accompanying breaker system. The paper presents the laboratory data that helped us evaluate cross link times, temperature stability, break times, and regained permeability. In laboratory tests, DHEC showed potential to effectively prevent loss of 1 7.2-lb/gal ZnBr brine for up to 36 hours at 215 F. Afterward, the breaker system broke the DHEC within 30 minutes. After this cleanup procedure was applied, the test cores had retained an average of 90% of their original permeability. In actual field applications, the fluid-loss material effectively controlled 17.2-ib/gal ZnBr2 in a GOM subsalt well while the operator used fracpacks to complete three separate zones in the same well.P. 269

AB  - Abstract The fluid-loss behavior of cement slurries and its relation to rheological properties is being examined using a dynamic fluid-loss apparatus. This instrument has the capacity to test slurry dehydration by sequential displacement of drilling muds, spacers, chemical washes and cement slurries through a drilled hole in a formation core. Dehydration of cement slurries containing a cellulose-based fluidloss additive was investigated as a function of flow rates and pressures. Results of these tests show that rapid cement water-loss occurs, followed by a reduced fluid-loss rate which remains constant with time. However, dehydration of cement slurries under static conditions results in decreasing fluid-loss behavior with time. Cement fluid-loss control under dynamic conditions was examined as a function of pressure, temperature, fluid-loss additive concentration, pressure, temperature, fluid-loss additive concentration, and slurry velocity. The effects of sequential displacement of drilling muds, chemical washes, and spacers by a cement slurry upon fluid-loss control was also investigated. While there is clearly much more work needed to understand fluid-loss control under dynamic conditions, it is apparent from these results that the static method of fluid-loss testing is not relevant to the deposition of filter cakes under dynamic conditions. The understanding gained in this work will be instrumental in designing cementing treatments with minimal cement slurry fluid-loss. Introduction Fluid-loss additives are used in cement slurries to assist in maintaining a constant water-to-solids ratio by reducing water-loss to permeable formations. Inhibition of cement slurry dehydration during primary cementing operations allows greater cement primary cementing operations allows greater cement fill-up, maintains initial viscosity, and reduces formation damage. It will also reduce the possibility of annular bridging by dehydrated cement. The present laboratory testing for evaluation of fluid-loss consists of application of pressure to a cement slurry in a standard filter cell? The water-loss through a 325-mesh screen is measured as a function of time. This type of testing is basically static in nature with the actual cementing operation taking place under dynamic conditions. The term, dynamic, refers to fluid motion along the core surface and static refers to the lack of motion. In addition, present cement fluid-loss testing does not take into present cement fluid-loss testing does not take into consideration the deposition of a mud cake with sequential displacement of the drilling mud by washes and spacers. Previous studies of dynamic filtration of drilling muds have shown that water-loss from a circulating mud is greater than shown by static test results. However, there has been no dynamic study of the effect on cement fluid-loss behavior through a formation face by displacement of drilling muds, spacers, and chemical washes by cement slurries. This study deals with dynamic filtration of cement slurries as a function of differential pressure, temperature and flow rates through a hole in a pressure, temperature and flow rates through a hole in a formation core. In addition, cement water-loss behavior was further investigated by displacement of drilling muds and chemical washes by a cement slurry. The effect on cement water-loss of the deposited mud cake on the formation surface was studied by mechanically removing the mud cake. This process would correspond to using scratchers during a cementing operation. EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURE A schematic diagram of the test equipment used to study dynamic fluid-loss behavior of cement slurries is shown in Fig. 1. An adjustable, triplex pump unit which is capable of flow rates up to 315 cc/sec was used to circulate the slurries through a 1.27-cm bore in a 20.32-cm x 6.35-cm Berea sandstone core held in place by two pressurized pistons. Velocities up to place by two pressurized pistons. Velocities up to 350 cm/sec (11.5 ft/sec) could be obtained as a result of the formation bore size.

AB  - AbstractDuring completion and workover operations high rate fluid loss isencountered in many wells due to the presence of highly permeable and naturallyfractured, depleted formations. Several methods to obtain temporary plugginghave been studied to select the most versatile technique for different fieldconditions. In addition to the laboratory results, field trials have beenperformed for detailed and comparative evaluation of loss control compositions.These compositions included polymers and sized calcium carbonate systems,polymers and sized micronized (fibrous) cellulose combinations, polymers andsized salt systems (medium and high temperature formulations), crosslinkedpolymer gel plugs, and delayed swelling, stabilized (extended life) polymersystems. The role of fluid chemistry in prevention of formation damage,extension of gelation temperature, and temperature stability was alsoinvestigated. The temperature and differential pressure of the formations(sandstone limestone, conglomerate, metamorfite, etc) varied between 60-170°C,and 1-15 MPa respectively. Fluid compositions without imposing severepermeability damage were selected, which can be broken down chemically. Casestudies of field operations performed in Hungary are also presented.IntroductionDuring completion and workover operations high volume fluid loss may beencountered due to the presence of highly permeable (matrix and/or fractured)formations. This problem is especially critical in case of depletedreservoirs.Complete losses are increasingly common in our recent field experience.Current fluid technology offers various methods in combating loss ofcirculation. We have conducted an extensive laboratory and field testingprogram to evaluate several additive/fluid systems to aid in solving high-rate,through perforation fluid loss problems encountered in completion and workoverjobs.Our work concentrated on medium-temperature (100 - 140°C) matrix-type losszones, however the results are applicable to other conditions (high temperaturefracture-dominated formations, low temperature underconsolidated sandstones,etc.) as well. Several combinations of additives having either bridging orfiltering effect were evaluated, as we needed a plug with adequate mechanicalstrength to withstand very high differential pressures, and with good filteringefficiency to minimize fluid invasion.

AB  - SummaryAcid fluid loss is extremely difficult to control and is generally considered to be the major factor limiting the effectiveness of acid fracturing treatments. Chemical erosion of fracture faces and the development of wormholes are largely responsible for the reduced efficiency of acid fracturing fluids. The creation of acid wormholes increases the effective area from which leakoff occurs, thus reducing the acid hydraulic efficiency. Once wormholes form, most acid fluid loss originates from these wormholes rather than penetrating uniformly into the fracture face.Methods of acid fluid-loss control are discussed and evaluated with an improved fluid-loss test procedure. This procedure uses limestone cores of sufficient length to contain wormhole growth. Studies demonstrate that if wormhole growth can be controlled, acid fluid loss approaches that of nonreactive fluids.An improved acid fracturing fluid having unique rheological characteristics is described. This acid has a low initial viscosity but temporarily becomes extremely viscous during leakoff. This high leakoff viscosity blocks wormhole development and prevents acid entry into natural fractures. After the treatment, spent-acid viscosity declines rapidly to ensure easier cleanup.IntroductionAcid fracturing is a well stimulation process in which acid, usually HCl, is injected into a carbonate formation at pressures sufficient to fracture the formation or to open existing natural fractures. As acid flows along the fracture, portions of the fracture face are dissolved. Because flowing acid tends to erode fracture faces nonunion formly, conductive channels, which usually remain after fracture closure, are created. The effective fracture length is determined by the volume of acid used, its reaction rate, and the acid fluid-loss rate. Productivity improvement is largely a function of the length of the etched fracture.The maximum effective distance obtainable by acid fracturing is limited by either spending or fluid loss. If the acid spends too rapidly, the etched portion of the fracture will be rather short. If acid fluid-loss characteristics are poor, excessive leakoff will terminate fracture growth. It is commonly believed that, at low to moderate temperatures, acid leakoff is the dominant factor limiting the effective length of the etched fracture.During many, if not most, acid fracturing treatments, the treating pressure declines continually, eventually falling below a level required to propagate the fracture. Thus, fracture extension becomes impossible. In some cases, treating pressure never reaches a level sufficient to initiate a hydraulic fracture, indicating that the acid is expended in a matrix treatment of the near-wellbore region. For maximum stimulation results, the treating pressure must remain above fracturing pressure during the entire treatment. Acid pumped below this pressure cannot contribute to fracture extension.Fluid-loss control during acid fracturing of carbonate formations presents problems unique to reactive fluids. Most fluid-loss additives and gelling agents used in nonreactive aqueous fracturing fluids are unstable in acid. As a result, special acid-stable additives must be used. In addition, acid flow along carbonate fracture surfaces produces constant chemical erosion, thus making it difficult for wall-building fluids to deposit an effective filter cake. Another complcation is that during leakoff, acid tends to enlarge certain larger pores and natural fractures selectively, resulting in wormholes and channels perpendicular to the fracture face. This phenomenon greatly increases the effective surface area from which leakoff occurs and is generally believed to affect acid fluid loss adversely.Various additives and treating techniques have been developed as means of controlling acid fluid loss. One of the earliest acid fluid-loss additives was karaya gum. Unlike most natural gums, karaya gum does not readily dissolve in acid but forms small swollen particles that act to block wormholes physically in the early stages of their development. The effectiveness of karaya gum is limited, however, by its rapid acid hydrolysis at temperatures above 125 degrees F [52 degrees C]. To overcome this problem, synthetic acid-swellable polymers were later developed. Although these materials performed well in laboratory tests, field treatments produced mixed results. In addition to suffering from mixing and gravity-separation problems, the increased polymer stability occasionally resulted in poor or in-complete posttreatment cleanup. To be effective, additives must be stable in acid at elevated tem-perature. Fluid-loss additives that are stable in hot acid, however, are generally very difficult to dissolve or to degrade after the treatment. One method of overcoming this problem involves the use of an oil-soluble acid fluid-loss additive. Additives of this type are usually composed of a mixture of oil-soluble resins. This resin mixture consists of rigid larger-size material, which acts to bridge large pores in the formation. and a smaller-size pliable resin, which serves as a filtration-control agent by deforming and sealing the spaces between the larger particles. Nierode and Kruk evaluated the performance of various acid fluid-loss additives against long limestone cores and found an oil-soluble resin mixture to be the only product capable of controlling acid fluid loss at differential pressures simulating those encountered downhole. The major limitation of this sytem is the high concentration of additive required for fluid-loss control. At the required concentration of 200 Ibm/1,000 gal [24 kg/m3], high additive costs have limited the commercial application of this product.Acid fluid-loss additives generally are not often used because of performance and cost limitations. As a result, alternative methods of fluid-loss control are sometimes incorporated. The most common technique involves injection of a viscous, nonreactive pad preceding the acid. This technique usually includes a water-based fracturing fluid to cool the fracture and to lay down an impermeable filter cake on the fracture face. While the technique is widely used, studies have shown that such fitter cakes are relatively ineffective for acid fluid-loss control. Laboratory tests reveal that the filter cake is quickly penetrated by wormholes resulting from even small amounts of acid leakoff. Once this occurs, acid fluid loss is identical to that observed if no pad were used.While the use of the pad probably provides only limited acid fluid-loss control, it does have other useful functions. It cools the tubular goods through which the acid must flow, thus reducing corrosion. It also cools the fracture and increases fracture width, resulting in reduced acid reaction rate and increased live-acid penetration. As an added benefit, the viscous pad promotes acid fingering, thus reducing the amount of reactive surface area to which the acid is exposed and improving fracture length and conductivity.Recognizing the limitations of a single stage of pad for controlling acid fluid loss, researchers developed variations of this technique. In one such procedure, the fracture is initially created by a gelled pad, after which alternating stages of acid and additional pad are pumped. These additional pad stages are designed to enter and seal wormholes created by the preceding acid. Alternating acid and gel stages allows acid leakoff into wormholes and enlarged natural fractures to be controlled and treatment efficiency to be im-proved. Fine particulate material is often added to the pad stage to aid in fluid-loss control.SPEPEP. 215^

AB  - Abstract A population of over 360 wells from six shale play areas was investigated to assess the impact of various early production management strategies, with attention given to the time delay between stimulation and first production, the "resting?? or "soak?? period, the effect of subsequent shut-ins, proppant conductivity and interfacial tension management.  Subsets of this population were used to perform the various evaluations.  The use of the non-volatile or persistent interfacial tension management chemistry significantly mitigated, but did not prevent, damage arising from delay to first production or shut-ins. Based on the performance metric used, delay to first production is not beneficial.  However, based on other data, the likelihood of improvement when using persistent interfacial tension management is slightly better than even odds, but without it, only about one in three.  Once on production, if the rate with which the flowing pressure was decreased exceeded about 100 psi per day, a significant negative impact on the reservoir / wellbore connectivity was observed.  The last control factor was the obvious benefit derived from using high conductivity proppants, in conjunction with the persistent interfacial tension management.

AB  - Abstract The Downhole Reservoir Raman System (DRRS) is a wireline conveyed Raman spectrometer and physical sensor platform that may be used to evaluate the resource potential of hydrocarbons in unconventional reservoirs. It is a robust tool that can measure low ppm levels of hydrocarbons dissolved in water in a well as well as discriminating in real time between the presence of dissolved methane, free methane gas and other light hydrocarbons. We present the results of two successful field trials of the DRRS that have been conducted in evaluation of the Marcellus shale Formation in the Appalachian basin in PA. The technical objective of both field trials was to identify and quantify hydrocarbon resource density as well as the most favorable location(s) for the placement of a lateral. Field trial-1 was conducted in an uncased well in McKean County, PA. In this well, the Marcellus is only ~30 ft. thick but the results of several logging runs established the clear presence of methane entering the well bore to a resolution of better than ~2 ft. Field trial-2 was conducted in a cased well in Potter County, PA where the Marcellus shale is almost 100 ft. thick. Based on Spectral Gamma Ray logging, the Marcellus in this part of PA is composed of three distinct lithofacies (Basal, Middle and Upper zones), easily recognized by their petrophysical rock properties such as Spectral Gamma Ray response (Uranium content), TOC, bulk density, porosity and gas saturation. Logging was conducted in three separate stages, progressing vertically from the Basal zone. Each zone was ~10 ft. in height and perforated with a high shot density. After perforation, the interval was logged using the DRRS in both dynamic and static modes. After logging, the perforated interval was sealed off using packers. DRRS data provide a real time estimate of plume formation in the well, allowing for an estimate of the mass of methane entering the well per unit time. This flux measurement provides therefore, in real time, an estimate of the composition and relative richness of different stratigraphic intervals within the Marcellus shale. The results of field trial-2 showed that the most productive interval was the Upper zone, producing gas to the well bore at a considerably faster rate than the more TOC rich and higher porosity Basal zone. These results challenge an established paradigm of unconventional resource evaluation which is focused mostly on high Uranium and TOC intervals for completion of laterals. Based on measured plume concentrations in our two field trials, the estimated resource density i.e., the mass of methane per volume of rock, is highest in the Upper Marcellus. Based on our DRRS results we would prioritize completion of the Upper zone with a lateral in this well.

AB  - A differential gravity tube is formed by incomplete mixing of two miscible liquids of different gravities. If it is done in a graduate cylinder or buret the graduations are easily changed to gravity units of density. This is done by putting materials of known density in the tube and they will assume a location in the tube according to the gravity of the liquid at the spot where they float. It can be done with test minerals of known gravities or with synthetic materials impervious to the solvent characteristics of the liquids used. Synthetic materials are more easily obtained without air entrapped within them and also can be readily obtained in thin flat form which float in a horizontal plane to give accurate readings that are easy to take. Also they are readily available in quantity at low cost.

AB  - Summary High-pressure, low-permeability reservoirs have been encountered in various parts of the world within the past few years. Commercial development of these reservoirs may require operating wells with high drawdown pressures, possibly in excess of 6,000 psi. The effects of drawdown pressures in this range are increases in near-wellbore temperatures because of Joule-Thomson expansion of the reservoir fluids and significant reductions in oil viscosity. The effects of high drawdown pressures are evaluated with a transient, single-phase thermal simulator in which the oil viscosity is modeled as both temperature and pressure dependent and Joule-Thomson expansion and viscous dissipation effects are considered. Results indicate near-wellbore temperature increases of 4 to 28°F for drawdowns between 2,000 to 10,000 psi because of Joule-Thomson expansion of the reservoir oil and connate water. Furthermore, if oil viscosity is not modeled as pressure dependent, skin values from well tests and productivity indices will be underpredicted. Temperature profiles within the formation are presented for a range of rates and drawdowns. Technical rationale is also presented to explain the transient heating or cooling phenomena that occur immediately after a rate change. Synthetic well tests are generated to illustrate the effect of high drawdown on well test interpretation. These tests show a region of improved mobility in the near-wellbore region because of the reduction in the oil viscosity. Introduction Commercial production rates for deep, high-pressure and low-permeability reservoirs may require high drawdowns. This is particularly true if stimulation techniques such as hydraulic fracturing or acidizing are not feasible because of technical limitations, operational constraints, or cost. Oil viscosity must be modeled as a function of pressure and, to a lesser extent, temperature for accurate productivity predictions and well test analysis. While the dependency of oil viscosity on pressure and temperature is well established (McCain 1973), applications to drawdowns in the range of 6,000 to 10,000 psi have rarely been considered. The definition of drawdown considered in this study refers to the difference between the pressure at the reservoir outer radius and the wellbore flowing pressure. It does not refer to pressure gradients within the near-wellbore region. Drawdowns of this magnitude constrained to the near-wellbore region would certainly be catastrophic for either the completion equipment or the formation.

AB  - AbstractUncertainties in productivity loss due to drilling induced formation damage are studied using a near-wellbore numerical simulator, which integrates laboratory data on formation damage testing. To quantify these uncertainties, experimentaldesigns combined with the Response Surface Methodology are used to assess the impact of uncertain parameters on formation damage. This approach allows to identify the most influential parameters on well productivity loss and to estimate the risks of formation damage. A good control of the most sensitive parameters can limit productivity loss. This approach provides key recommendations for the selection of drilling fluid to maximize well performance. IntroductionIt has been recognized that formation damage due to drilling fluid has a huge impact on well productivities, especially for horizontal wells which are completed with open hole or slotted liner. The degree of formation damage depends upon a large number of parameters such as the nature and characteristics of drilling fluid, formation properties and operating conditions. Inoverbalanced drilling (OBD), formation damage is caused by the presence of filter cakes and invading drilling fluid in porous media1-9. In underbalanced drilling (UBD), even if the pressure gradient is negative, drilling fluid invasion into reservoir can still occur due to the presence of capillary pressure or temporary overbalanced pressure10-12. The economic impact of poor productivity of open hole wells has pushed toward significant efforts in recent years to study laboratory testing techniques10,11 and numerical modelling methods13-21 for assessing drilling induced formation damage. Although some progress have been made in laboratoryexperiments and numerical modelling to quantify the impact of formation damage on well productivities, it does not really consider the uncertainties in laboratory measurement and especially the uncertainties in input parameters for formation damage simulations. Due to limited laboratory conditions, the characteristics of filter cake and the effect of damage by filtrate in porous media cannot often be accurately measured. The depth of filtrate invasion depends also on operating conditions (drilling pressure, rate of well penetration ?) as well as formation properties (reservoir permeability, porosity, 1). Generally speaking, we are not sure of the real value of some parameters, but we can estimate their ranges of variation. It is therefore essential to quantify the impact of these data uncertainties on the evaluation of the drilling induced formation damage. We present here a study aiming at quantifying theuncertainty in productivity loss. Experimental design methodologies are used with the near-wellbore formation damage simulator. Experimental design combined with the Response Surface Methodology (RSM) 22-26 has been recently used in oil/gas industry for uncertainty study in oil reserves, production forecasting, development optimization, etc. In this paper, we use this method to assess the impact of various uncertain input parameters on formation damage. This method allows to identify the most influential parameters on wellproductivity and to estimate the risks of formation damage. A good control of the most sensitive parameters can limit the nearwellbore formation damage. Uncertainty assessment can also help the selection of drilling fluid to maximize well performance.

AB  - ABSTRACTResearch on the effect of colloidal materials on the filtration properties of clear water and brine has led to the development of agents which are effective in minute quantities as fluid-loss-reducing agents for drilling and workover fluids. These agents are used in concentrations ranging from 0.05 to 0.15 percent by weight (approximately 0.15 to 0.5 lb per bbl). They are effective over a wide range of permeability, in the presence or absence of oil saturation, in either clay-containing or clay-free formations, and do not significantly affect productivity.The materials were evaluated as fluid-loss reducers using sandstone discs rather than filter paper, because filtration rates obtained using paper were found to be unrealistic when testing water which contains little solids material. A vegetable gum compound and a mixture of starch and bentonite were found to be the most effective additives. Successful field applications of these materials as additives for workover and completion fluids are described.INTRODUCTIONIn planning the drilling, completion, or workover of a well, the selection of the fluid to be used is of major importance. The fluid should have a low filtrate loss to avoid forming a thick mud filter cake on the wall of the hole and to minimize flushing of productive zones. In wells where a high-density fluid is not required, clear water offers advantages over conventional mud as a drilling fluid because it gives faster penetration rates, greater footage per bit, anti lower costs. It has been found that use of a clear brine as a completion or workover fluid results in faster and cleaner repair jobs than does mud.The disadvantages of using clear water or brine systems for drilling or workover is that fluid loss is often excessive. It is sometimes difficult even to maintain circulation when fluid loss is extremely high. Difficulty is encountered in circulating sand and debris from wells when fluid loss is excessive and the danger of sticking tools exists. In view of the possible benefits that can be obtained through use of clear fresh water or brine as a drilling, completion, or workover fluid, tests were conducted to develop agents for reducing the filtrate loss of clear-water systems.PROCEDURELaboratoryConventional permeability tests were conducted to compare the flow rates of untreated and treated water through sandstone cores and to find the effects of the waters on oil permeability. The cores were 1 in. long and 0.75 in. in diameter. The liquids were flowed at a pressure of 50 psi across the cores to minimize relative permeability end effects. Oil was flowed in the direction opposite to which water was introduced to simulate production of oil from a formation. The fluids were in laminar flow. In a different series of experiments, tests similar to API mud filtration tests11,2 were conducted using sandstone discs as septa rather than filter paper. The reason for using sandstone discs is discussed in a later section. A Baroid Model 380 high-temperature - high-pressure mud filter press was modified to accept the discs by scoring

AB  - Summary Production of gas can result in drying of the near-wellbore region caused by gas expansion, which causes evaporation and hence salt deposition. The deposition of salt leads to a reduction in porosity and permeability of the rock in the near-wellbore region, which then leads to reduction in well productivity. The main objective of this work is to understand the role of capillarity on salt deposition and its impact on well flow efficiency. We develop and solve the dimensionless-conservation equations for solid-salt saturation using numerical methods under radial-flow conditions. The results of the calculations show that when the capillary effects are strong, the salt accumulates near the wellbore, which leads to plugging and hence higher skin values. The salt saturation continues to evolve until a limiting value, in the rock pores, is reached. Higher values of the limiting saturation lead to a greater reduction in permeability and therefore result in a larger skin value for the gas well. The flow efficiency of a gas well, calculated as a dimensionless ratio of the flow with and without skin, decreases continually and asymptotically approaches a constant value. In a simulation for a typical field case, we find that the largest increase in skin factor and corresponding decrease in flow efficiency occur in approximately the first 30 days, after which the changes are slower. When connate-water salt concentration is higher, the skin value is much higher and thus the well productivity is lower. Using the model developed in this study, the decline of gas-well productivity caused by salt deposition can be predicted and hence accurate timing of well operations, such as water wash, can be made. Also, the modeling study can be used to select remediation strategies such as wettability alteration to reduce capillarity or application of inhibitors, which can reduce the limiting salt saturation by preventing growth of salt crystals within the reservoir rock.

AB  - Abstract Diagnostic plots of production decline of wells producing from unconventional reservoirs provide a particularly interesting field of study, given the fast-growing unconventional completion methods in the United States. In this paper, we present a method for analyzing fracture quality in horizontal wells with multiple stages of fracturing draining unconventional reservoirs. Our method, which explains a plausible cause for reduced production and rapid production decline, includes a log-log plot of the inverse production rate change vs. time. This diagnostic plot was used to analyze forty oil-producing wells drilled in the Bakken formation and ten gas wells producing from the Marcellus formation. From these graphs, we first observed that regardless of the number of fracturing stages, a plot of a system of fractures behaves as one equivalent fracture. Second, we noted that in some cases; a bilinear flow is observed, indicating strong support of the induced fractures by the formation. This is followed by a linear flow period. Furthermore, the duration of fracture linear flow indicates the quality of the induced fracture system in the formation. Crossflow among the induced fractures is noted. This can explain the deterioration of well productivity. A summary of these observations and the appropriate explanation behind this analysis method is presented. This diagnostic method used can help in monitoring causes of low production quality and low recovery factor from individual wells and in seeking solutions.

AB  - Summary Liquid blocking in some gas-condensate reservoirs is a serious problem when the permeability is low (for example, of the order of 10 md or less). The current practice centers mainly on hydraulic fracturing to improve gas flow. In most cases, the frequency of application results in high costs. An alternative is the permanent alteration of wettability from liquid-wetting to preferentially gas-wetting. In this work, we present an experimental study of wettability alteration to preferential gas-wetting using a multifunctional surfactant and polymer synthesized for this particular application. The treatments are performed with an alcohol-based-surfactant/polymer solution. We treat Berea cores and reservoir-rock samples from two gas-condensate reservoirs. In one of the reservoirs, water blocking has resulted in a significant reduction of well deliverability. The treatment provides significant improvement on the phase mobility. In this study, our focus is the investigation of water/gas two-phase flow at high temperatures (80 and 140°C). Basic measurements such as contact angle, spontaneous imbibition, and the effect on the absolute permeability are discussed. The initial liquid saturation at the time of treatment may have an influence on the wettability alteration. The results of the treatment on oil-saturated and water-saturated cores are presented. The treatment by alcohol without using the polymer is compared and discussed. Two-phase-flow tests in single-phase and two-phase injections are performed before and after the treatment using brine and gas. Relative permeabilities of gas and water are measured, and the improvement after the treatment is presented. Various measurements in our work show that water and gas relative permeability increase significantly in a wide range, especially at high liquid saturation. Introduction The exploitation of low-permeability gas-condensate reservoirs has received increased emphasis in recent years. Liquid trapping (water or condensate blocking) around a wellbore is one of the major causes of reduced productivity in low-permeability gas-condensate reservoirs. Formation damage by the loss of aqueous fluids by operations such as drilling, fracturing, or acidizing is a potential source of reduced productivity of gas reservoirs because it causes water accumulation (water blocking) near the wellbore. Water blocking is caused by capillary pressure, which tends to imbibe and hold the liquid phase, resulting in a reduction of gas mobility. The decrease in water saturation from hydraulic fracturing around the wellbore is a slow process when the permeability is low and the capillary forces are high. The investigation of the gas/water relative permeabilities can determine the gas-mobility loss associated with the change of water saturation.

AB  - Abstract The selection of proppant to provide highly conductive pathways in hydraulically-generated fractures is typically based on the proppant crush strength, permeability, availability, and cost. Extensive laboratory data determined conductivity values, obtained using API standardized methods at a variety of simulated well conditions, are available for most proppants. However, post-fracture stimulation well testing indicates that these values are often one to two orders of magnitude too high. In many fields, the productivity of fractures declines rapidly, requiring frequent re-stimulation treatments to remain economically viable. Proppant crushing and embedment, fracturing-fluid damage, and fines invasion are proppant-pack permeability damage mechanisms that have been used to explain this loss of productivity. This paper reports on recent studies that have determined that alumina-based proppant materials may promote geochemical reactions that can occur at a surprisingly rapid rate, even at moderate temperatures, resulting in the loss of porosity and permeability and the creation of fines in the proppant pack. The compatibilities of several man-made proppants ranging from lightweight ceramics to high-strength bauxites with a variety of formations are presented.INTRODUCTIONHydraulic-fracture stimulation (HFS) is the process of pumping fluid under pressure to fracture earth formations. These fractures are usually “propped open” by leaving them filled with a high-permeability pack of granular material (proppant) that provides a highly conductive pathway from the reservoir to the well.In the typical HFS operation, massive spreads of equipment are used to: Isolate the zone of interest (ZOI) (the zone with potential to produce oil and/or gas). Perforate the well casing with shaped charge guns or hydrajet with abrasives entrained in fluid to create holes in the casing interval that crosses the ZOI. Mix a viscous carrier fluid by adding gelling agents (e.g., powdered guar) to water or one of various oils (there is a movement away from using hydrocarbons, because of the risk of environmental damage). Blend proppant (mined sand or man-made) with the viscous fluid (usually done “on-the-fly”) as the fluid is pumped into the wellbore. Using pumps with outputs exceeding 2,000 hydraulic horsepower (HHp) each; pump the blended fracture fluid (through jointed tubing or coiled tubing) into the ZOI. Multiple pumps can be manifolded together to provide extreme pumping rates and pressures. Because the fracture fluid is sealed into the wellbore interval adjacent to the ZOI, the fluid travels through the perforations under great pressure and extends the fractures into the reservoir rock containing the hydrocarbons (oil and gas) being sought. After the fracture has been initiated, proppant volumes are increased to open a wider fracture in the reservoir and fill the fracture with a permeable pack that will provide easy paths for hydrocarbons to flow into the wellbore and on to the surface for marketing.Much effort has gone into standardizing the selection of proppants to optimize stimulation cost against expected stimulation results. Many proppant materials are available, including natural sands, ceramics, sintered minerals, plastics, and composite materials.

AB  - Abstract One primary purpose of hydraulic fracturing as a well stimulation technique is to overcome formation damage. The literature provides ways of designing fracture treatments and evaluating their results but not of incorporating formation damage in vertically fractured wells. Results of an investigation of this problem are presented in this paper. Prediction of stimulation ratios in vertically fractured, damaged wells is accomplished with a mathematical model relating stimulation ratio to relative conductivity of fractures whose lengths are not more than about half the drainage radius of the well. Comparison of results from the new model to results in published predictions verify its utility; these results also show that the range of stimulation ratios that can he predicted for undamaged wells is extended to include relative conductivities of less than 300. This extension is important when using fracturing to stimulate wells with high production rates and high native formation permeabilities. For example, large increases in daily oil production rate can be obtained with stimulation ratio increases as low as 1.25. The importance of complete fracture fill-up (uniform proppant packing) is shown through use of the mathematical model. If, at the mouth of a fracture, only a small fraction (1/2 percent) of the total fracture length is not packed with proppant, nearly all the potential stimulation increase is lost. Proppant crushing, compaction and embedment have been shown in laboratory studies to be responsible for low fracture conductivities in wells producing from highly stressed formations. Equipment and methods for testing the effect of stress (overburden) on conductivity of fractures in consolidated and unconsolidated sands are discussed in this paper. Laboratory tests with simulated fractures in cores from both types of formations showed that crushing, compaction and embedment seriously affect conductivity. Results indicate that similar laboratory tests should be made when accurate knowledge of fracture conductivity is needed to assure good stimulation results for important wells. The chief factor in stimulation ratio reduction was found to be overburden pressure, but the size and type of proppant and the hardness of the formation have significant effects. Fracture conductivity reductions of up to 50 percent were observed with sand propping fractures in consolidated cores; a reduction of 83 percent was measured for an unconsolidated core. The range of effective overburden pressures for which conductivities were measured was from 100 to 5,000 psi. An example fracture design and evaluation problem indicates the usefulness of considering formation damage in planning well stimulation jobs. When damage exists, but its extent and the degree of permeability reduction are not estimated from diagnostic tests, the formation permeability used in planning the job may lead to underdesigning. As the example shows, too low a target stimulation ratio can lead to much lower production rates (by half) than could be attained otherwise. Solutions of equations representing several special cases of the mathematical model are presented in graphical form and details of the derivations of the equations are given in the Appendix. Introduction Since its inception in 1947, hydraulic fracturing has proven to be an effective and widely accepted stimulation technique. In the past 18 years the ability to execute a successful hydraulic fracturing treatment has been substantially increased. The development of design and evaluation procedures has been one of the major contributions to this increased skill. However, as the art of hydraulic fracturing has moved closer to a science, new problems concerning the design and evaluation of the optimal hydraulic fracturing treatment have arisen. Three questions are pertinent to these problems. 1. How is a fracturing job evaluated in a damaged well? 2. What is the effect on the stimulation ratio of not filling the fracture in the vicinity of the wellbore. 3. What is the effect of overburden pressure on fracture conductivity and, consequently, the stimulation ratio? A primary objective of fracturing a well is to stimulate production by overcoming wellbore damage. Presently, however, there is no rational basis for designing or evaluating the optimal fracturing treatment in a damaged well. All present fracture design and evaluation techniques assume that proppants can be uniformly placed in fractures. This assumption may be in serious error, particularly for the portion of a fracture directly adjacent to the wellbore. In this area, turbulence of the injected fluid can cause the proppant to be swept farther into the fracture. JPT P. 120^

Abstract Many currently accepted drilling and producing practices cause appreciable formation damage. Major changes in field operations are required to prevent or alleviate this damage. In planning a coordinated attack on formation damage, the Creative Task Force offers a proved approach to bring about desired results. Case histories of major task force projects relating to formation damage are presented. presented. Because of the potential economic impact on the oil and gas business, an all out attack on formation damage should be solidly supported by Management of the various oil and gas producers, service companies, drilling producers, service companies, drilling contractors, and workover contractors on a worldwide basis. Introduction Formation damage causes significant loss of both short and long term profits in the Petroleum Industry, and probable loss of millions of barrels of recoverable oil and billions of cubic feet of gas. Many currently accepted drilling and producing practices introduced during the era of abundant reserves and excess producing capacity in the U.S. cause appreciable formation damage. major changes in field practices are required to prevent or alleviate this damage. Needed changes have probably been delayed for some 25 years because of poor producing economics related in a large degree to low prices for oil and gas. However, there also appears to be the lack of appreciation of the magnitude and widespread extent of the damage problem.

AB  - IntroductionHydraulic fracturing has yielded successful stimulation results inhydrocarbon producing reservoirs for over 40 years. In certain reservoirs,however, hydraulic fracturing does not always achieve the desired results. Insome cases, due to excess production of proppant or excess water production,the fracture treatment can cause proppant or excess water production, thefracture treatment can cause operating problems. A paper published by Robinsonet at. discussed the merits of flowing back a well on a small choke to minimizethe closure stress on the proppant. In that paper, a recommendation was made tomonitor the tubing pressures after the fracture treatment, and if closure timesappear to be excessive, then one should initiate a low rate flowback of thefracture fluid to assist fracture closure.Approximately 4 years ago, the initial treatment designed to use the"forced closure" technique was conducted on a Canyon Sand well in westTexas. The fracture treatment was successful, but the most surprising aspect ofthe procedure was that significantly less proppant was produced after thetreatment when compared to other proppant was produced after the treatment whencompared to other wells in the area. In the last few years, the forced closuretechnique been used on several hundred wells in many different geologichorizons.The forced closure technique, alone, may not be the reason for success.However, the use of forced closure combined with the use of aggressive proppantscheduling and the application of "intense quality control" can lead todramatic improvements in stimulation success. Intense quality control involvesfield testing of fracturing fluids at reservoir temperature prior to pumpingoperations. In this paper, field results have been included to illustrate howthe forced closure technique, coupled with high proppant concentrations andintense quality control, can proppant concentrations and intense qualitycontrol, can significantly increase the productivity of low permeability oiland gas wells.Most of the early applications of the forced closure technique involved theuse of foam fracturing fluids or polyemulsion fluids. As more was teamed aboutthe procedure, forced closure was used regardless of the fracturing fluid beingused during the treatment. Experience indicates that the forced closuretechnique will work even when crosslinked fluids are pumped. By flowing thewell back immediately at a low controlled rate after the pumping stops, theexcess pressure in and around the fracture can help to clean up the fluids.The forced closure technique has been used in formations ranging from thetight Devonian Shales in Appalachia to the high permeability coal seams in theSan Juan Basin. Table I presents a permeability coal seams in the San JuanBasin. Table I presents a list of formations that have been stimulated and thenproduced back using the forced closure technique.ADVANTAGES OF HIGH PROPPANT CONCENTRATIONSThe advantages of using high proppant concentration has been well documentedin the petroleum literature. Recent publications have shown that higherconcentrations are needed to minimize the effects of damage to the proppantpack caused by gel residue, fines and excess closure pressure. Experiencesuggests that aggressive proppant schedules will be beneficial because highsand proppant schedules will be beneficial because high sand concentrationswill result in a very viscous slurry. By using an aggressive pumping schedule,much higher sand concentrations have been successfully put away than thosepreviously pumped in similar wells.Fig. 1 is a graph that illustrates the effect of sand concentration upon theviscosity of a sand-liquid slurry. Notice that when the proppant concentrationis only 2-4 ppg, the slurry viscosity is only 10-20% larger than the liquidviscosity. However, at a concentration of 10 ppg, the slurry viscosity can be10 times larger than the liquid viscosity. Realistically, a 50 cp fluidcarrying 2-4 ppg of sand is not a very effective fracturing fluid. The same 50cp fluid carrying 8-10 ppg will be a thick, viscous, efficient fluid. The sandis actually a viscosifier when suspended in fluid.Under certain conditions, the use of smaller mesh proppants (20-40 mesh)will provide better stimulation than achieved with larger (12-20 mesh)proppants. When smaller mesh proppants are used, they can be transported betterand pumped deeper into the fracture. Also, after pumping, the smaller meshproppants will stay suspended for a longer period of time. Experience indicatesthat for low permeability reservoirs, high quality, smaller mesh proppants willnormally provide optimum stimulation results.P. 889

AB  - Abstract It is widely agreed that gas reservoirs with a component of water drive should be produced at high rates to minimize the volume of gas which is trapped at high pressure by the advancing water (often termed ‘outrunning the aquifer'). Yet high production rates are also associated with coning (in vertical wells) or cresting (in horizontal wells) of the encroaching water, leading to early water breakthrough. In vertical wells, the formation of an inverse gas cone means that high gas rates can be maintained post-breakthrough until almost the whole perforated interval is flowing water. However, in horizontal wells, water breakthrough is a serious threat to gas deliverability, because the inverse coning mechanism does not apply and the well rapidly loads with water. Consequently, it is not clear whether producing at high rates is the best strategy to maximize recovery in gas reservoirs developed using horizontal wells. We investigate the risk associated with producing horizontal wells at high rates by simulating gas recovery and aquifer response over a broad range of reservoir properties and production scenarios. We find that high rates always result in lower gas recovery unless the ratio of vertical to horizontal permeability is very low, in which case water cresting is suppressed. However, there are many instances where accelerating production recovers only slightly less gas over much shorter timescales, so may be economically favorable. Rate sensitivity increases in low permeability reservoirs with thin gas columns, because these conditions increase the tendency for water cresting, and decreases in reservoirs with strong aquifer support, since water breakthrough occurs regardless of the rate at which the well is produced. Our results can be used as a reference framework to rapidly assess gas production behavior and aquifer response within a wide range of field development scenarios. Introduction Horizontal and highly deviated wells are increasingly being used in gas field developments worldwide.1-5 Large-bore horizontal wells can deliver significantly higher gas production rates than conventional completions,2 reducing field development costs by allowing reserves to be targeted with fewer wells.4-6 However, realizing the potential of high-productivity gas wells requires an understanding of the subsurface risks to deliverability, to ensure sustained gas production, maximize profitability, and establish large-bore completions as an economically viable development option. A key subsurface risk in gas reservoirs with a component of water drive is early water breakthrough.3-5,7,8 In large-bore horizontal wells, early water breakthrough is a particularly serious threat to deliverability, because of the significant reduction in gas flow capacity associated with flowing entrained water to the surface.4,9-11 At best, substantial water production will require expensive processing facilities; at worst, it will effectively ‘kill' the well.3-5,12 Based on material balance considerations, it is widely agreed that gas reservoirs with a component of water drive should be produced at high rates. This approach (often described as ‘outrunning the aquifer') maximizes gas recovery by reducing the volume of gas which is trapped at high pressure by the advancing water.13-18 In this context, high productivity horizontal wells might be expected to make a positive contribution to gas recovery, because they can generally produce at much higher rates than vertical wells. However, material balance approaches assume that the gas-water contact (GWC) remains flat during production.13,14,16,18,20-22 Yet bottom-water drive gas reservoirs are associated with coning (in vertical wells) or cresting (in horizontal wells) of the GWC towards the well.7,23-28 Cresting occurs when viscous forces associated with pressure drawdown overcome gravity forces resulting from the density contrast between gas and water, causing a crest or cone of water to be drawn upwards towards the producing well29 (Fig. 1). Water crest behavior has been described using analytical approaches to predict a ‘critical rate' above which water breakthrough is expected,30,31 and time to water breakthrough.32,33 These approaches imply a sensitivity of gas recovery to production rate that conflicts with material balance techniques, as the severity of water cresting is increased with accelerated production, and therefore water breakthrough is expected earlier at higher rates. Water crest development also becomes more significant as the separation between the well and GWC is reduced, the horizontal reservoir permeability decreases, and the vertical permeability increases.29

AB  - Field-scale gravel-pack studies have shown that openhole gravel packs have higher productivity than cased-hole gravel packs; however, in the latter, well productivity can be improved by increasing the size and number of perforations. Results also show that cased-hole gravel-pack productivity can be enhanced by prepacking gravel outside the perforations. IntroductionGravel packing to exclude formation sand from produced fluids has been used as a completion technique for oil and gas wells for the past 40 to 50 years. However, the technology used in early gravelpack work was borrowed from the water-well industry, which for many years had been applying several types of mechanical sand retention devices to prevent sand production from produced groundwater. Early oil and gas completions, similar to those used in water wells, were what normally is referred to as openhole gravel packs (Fig. 1). Accurately sized gravel was placed around a slotted liner to act as a filter for formation sand. Subsequent completions sometimes consisted of cementing casing through the formation and perforating to communicate with the oil reservoir. This technique became common with the advent of gun and jet perforating, because the exclusion of water or gas was sometimes difficult to achieve in openhole gravel packs. If fluid production also resulted in sand production, cased-hole gravel packs were performed inside the well's casing (Fig. 1). The well productivity of these packs, however, quickly was recognized as being far below that experienced with the openhole packs. Field experience showed that, in general, the productivity of prepacked cased-hole completions was sometimes only 25 to 33% of that of the openhole pack, whereas the lack of prepacking could cause productivity losses of greater than 95%, as shown in Table 1. As a result of these problems, a whole new dimension in gravel packing arose with the cased-hole gravel-pack completion,, since substantially different techniques and procedures are required to perform these completions properly in comparison with openhole gravel packs. The productivity limitations encountered in cased-hole gravel packs prompted numerous engineers and researchers to begin work to define and solve problems related to them. Early work on the proper gravel size required for effective sand control indicated that gravel/sand ratios of from 5:1 to 13:1 should be used. Formation sand design points anywhere from a cumulative of 10 to 70% based on a representative formation sand sample were recommended. Most of the early research was conducted in linear-flow packs operated under single-phase flow conditions. Additional work indicated that the main restriction to flow was sand-filled perforations and that for maximum productivity, plugging in the perforation with formation sand must be avoided. The remedy for this situation has been to pressure-pack the gravel through the perforation so that the gravel in the perforation is of the highest permeability capable of preventing the production of formation sand.

AB  - Abstract Production of gas can result in drying of the near wellbore region due to gas expansion which causes evaporation and hence salt deposition. The deposition of salt leads to a reduction in porosity and permeability of the rock in the near wellbore which then leads to reduction in well productivity. The main objective of this work is to understand the role of salt deposition on well flow efficiency. Particularly, we investigate the effect of capillarity on the salt deposition process in reservoir. We develop and solve the dimensionless conservation equations for solid salt saturation using numerical methods under radial flow conditions. The results of the calculations show that when the capillary effects are strong, the salt accumulates near the wellbore which leads to plugging and hence higher skin values. The salt saturation continues to evolve until a limiting value, in the rock pores, is reached. Higher values of the limiting saturation leads to a greater reduction in permeability and hence results in a larger skin value for the gas well. The flow efficiency of a gas well, calculated as a dimensionless ratio of the flow with and without skin, decreases continually and asymptotically approaches a constant value. In a simulation for typical field case we find that the largest increase in skin factor and corresponding decrease in flow efficiency occurs in approximately the first 50 days after which the changes are slower. When connate water salt concentration is higher, the skin value is much higher and hence the well productivity is lower. Using the model developed in this study the decline of gas well productivity due salt deposition can be predicted and hence accurate timing of the well operations such as water wash can be made. Also, the modeling study can be used to select remediation strategies such as wettability alteration to reduce capillarity or application of inhibitors which can reduce the limiting salt saturation by preventing growth of salt crystals within the reservoir rock. Introduction and Literature Survey Salt deposition occurs when the solubility product of the dissolved ions are exceeded due to either evaporation or dissolution of rock minerals. Evaporation causes a reduction of water saturation and consequently an increase in the salt ion concentration. In gas wells, the evaporation takes place due to compressibility driven drying which is caused primarily by gas expansion in the near well bore region. Field observations of salt deposition in gas wells, reported in the study by Kleinitz et al. (2001), shows that salt may accumulate in the wellbore, perforation zone and in the reservoir. It is common to observe deposition of salt in the wellbore and tubing which are then cleaned with periodic water-wash operations. The paper hypothesizes that water vaporization will be significant when the reservoir pressures are lower (later period of production) and correspondingly the concentration of water in gas phase is higher. Decrease in pressure, therefore, is the most likely cause of water vaporization and hence salt deposition. It is possible that the pressure gradient in the reservoir can lead to non-uniform drying rates and hence localized salt deposition. Quotients of Na/K Na/(Ca+Cl), Na/Li ion concentration ratios are also proposed to detect the onset of deposition and hence enable stimulation treatment. Gas production from high pressure/high temperature (HPHT) reservoir containing brine shows plugging after specifics amount of gas are produced. In their study, Place and Smith (1984) observe that the well completely plugs after 1 Bcf production and the well needs a water-wash stimulation treatment. The paper however does not discuss any reservoir deposition of salt. Other instances of deposition of scale in the wellbore tubing in HPHT reservoir is also reported (Jasinski et. al 1997). In all cases the scale deposition is always associated with rapid reduction in pressure which causes evaporation and subsequent supersaturation of the salt.

AB  - Too frequently, today’s shipyards are a product of their history. Their organizations represent the experiences and successes of the personnel. In the past this has been adequate because the maritime business was largely subsidized by Federal Government programs. Reductions in these programs have directly reduced the business available to shipyards. As a result, shipyards are failing at a record rate. The prognosis is not good. This paper addresses one facet of improving a shipyard’s position in an increasingly competitive environment: improvements in overall productivity resulting from integration of the functions of the shipyard staff. First, an organization is described, identifying the staff and defining its purpose within the shipyard. In a typical shipyard, the staff includes organizations for estimating, planning, engineering, purchasing, and contracting. The responsibilities of each of these groups are discussed and, in particular, the areas of interface between them are highlighted. Using the information developed, the paper examines known problems, based on shipyard experiences, which are responsible for reduced productivity. The paper then provides an outline for integration of staff functions, using simple process control and data processing which will reduce staff overhead and provide improved estimating, material flow, and scheduling support to Production.

AB  - Abstract In this study, carbon steel corrosion was evaluated in salt water solutions using the newly developed non-destructive electrical method which can be easily adopted in the field for real-time monitoring and the results were compared to some standard test methods such as weight loss, corrosion rate and potential difference. The average weight loss in 10% salt solution (accelerated corrosion and also representing the hydraulic fracking fluids) in one year was 1.05% and corrosion rate was 1.54 mm/year, using the ASTM G1 method. Vipulanandan correlation model was used to represent the weight loss versus time relationship. The potential difference between the corroding steel and standard calomel electrode in 1M salt solution reduced from -0.680 V to -0.791 V in two years, a 15% total change. The use of the new nondestructive electrical method was to detect and quantify the surface and bulk corrosion in the field. Tests were performed to first verify the best electrical property that will be highly sensitive and represent the steel corrosion. The findings from this study indicated changes in the newly developed electrical corrosion index for the surface (2D representation) and the resistivity (second order tensor, 3D representation) for the bulk material using the Vipulanandan Impedance Corrosion Model. Corrosion development in 30 inches long steel specimens were studied in the 3.5% salt solution (simulating sea water) for 500 days. The changes in the specimens were monitored at regular intervals using the new two probe method and measuring the impedance-frequency relationship using alternative current up to a frequency of 300 kHz. The surface corrosion was quantified using the new electrical corrosion index parameter, which changed from point to point on the surface of the corroding steel and the change was over 200%. The change in the bulk resistivity along the length of the steel specimen was over 40,000 times (4,000,000%) in 3.5% salt solution compared to the weight loss and reduction in the potential difference. Hence the electrical resistivity for the bulk material and the new corrosion index for the surface corrosion are highly sensing parameters for detecting and quantify the corrosion in the steel.

AB  - Summary The selection of proppant to provide highly conductive pathways in hydraulically generated fractures is typically based on the proppant crush strength, permeability, availability, and cost. Extensive libraries of laboratory-determined conductivity values, obtained using API standardized methods at a variety of simulated well conditions, are available for most proppants. However, post-fracture-stimulation well testing indicates that these values are often one to two orders of magnitude too high. In many fields, the productivity of fractures declines rapidly, requiring frequent restimulation treatments to remain economically viable. Proppant crushing and embedment, fracturing-fluid damage, and fines invasion are proppant-pack permeability-damage mechanisms that have been used to explain this loss of productivity. This paper reports on recent studies that have determined that alumina-based proppant materials may promote geochemical reactions that can occur at a surprisingly rapid rate, even at moderate temperatures, resulting in the loss of porosity and permeability and the creation of fines in the proppant pack. The compatibilities of several man-made proppants, ranging from lightweight ceramics to high-strength bauxites, with a variety of formations are presented. These findings indicate that the formation mineralogy plays a heretofore unrecognized role in determining proppant suitability. Most proppants were found to lose 50-60% permeability before stabilizing, while others were shown to lose up to 90% in only a few days. This paper describes the specialized methods that were developed to study these geochemical reactions and reports quantitative changes in permeability, proppant composition, and fluid changes. Surface analysis using scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and energy-dispersive X-ray (EDX) analysis provides dramatic visual confirmation of this damage mechanism. Results of this study have a great potential economic significance, suggesting new, important fracture design parameters that need to be determined to enable choosing the appropriate proppant for maximized stimulation longevity.

AB  - In 1994, BLS reported 215 deaths resulting from exposure to harmful substances; 110 of these deaths were from oxygen deficiency (BLS, 2006). Safety awareness regarding respiratory protection has increased in the U.S. in the nearly 20 years since then. For example, a collaborative survey released in 2001 by NIOSH and BLS reported that in the U.S. more than 3.3 million people in 281,776 work establishments used respirators in their daily work. In 2010, 57 deaths resulting from the inhalation of harmful substances were reported (BLS, 2010).NIOSH (2001) also found that of the work sites where respirators were used in 2001, 50% used respirators voluntarily; 41% provided no respirator training to employees; 53% did not per-form medical fitness evaluations; 64% had no written respiratory program; and 76% performed no air sampling to assess hazards in order to select the proper type of respirator. All of these factors could lead to the improper selection or use of respirators (NIOSH).Although respiratory protection awareness has increased since 2001, respirator-related issues remain a concern. Respiratory protection was the third most cited OSHA violation in 2006 and 2007 (Doney, Greskevitch, Groce, et al., 2009). In 2011, it ranked as the fourth most cited violation (OSHA, 2011).

AB  - Abstract This paper presents a work-flow process to describe and characterize tight gas sands. The ultimate objective of this work-flow is to provide a consistent methodology to systematically integrate both large-scale geologic elements and small-scale rock petrology with the physical rock properties for low-permeability sandstone reservoirs. To that end, our work-flow integrates multiple data evaluation techniques and multiple data scales using a core-based rock typing approach that is designed to capture rock properties characteristic of tight gas sands. Fundamental to this process model are identification and comparison of three different rock types — depositional, petrographic, and hydraulic. These rock types are defined as: Depositional — These are rock types that are derived from core-based descriptions of genetic units which are defined as collections of rocks grouped according to similarities in composition, texture, sedimentary structure, and stratigraphic sequence as influenced by the depositional environment. These rock types represent original large-scale rock properties present at deposition. Petrographic — These are rock types which are also described within the context of the geological framework, but the rock type criteria are based on pore-scale, microscopic imaging of the current pore structure — as well as the rock texture and composition, clay mineralogy, and diagenesis. Hydraulic — These are rock types that are also defined at the pore scale, but in this case we define "hydraulic" rock types as those that quantify the physical flow and storage properties of the rock relative to the native fluid(s) — as controlled by the dimensions, geometry, and distribution of the current pore and pore throat structure. Each rock type represents different physical and chemical processes affecting rock properties during the depositional and paragenetic cycles. Since most tight gas sands have been subjected to post-depositional diagenesis, a comparison of all three rock types will allow us to assess the impact of diagenesis on rock properties. If diagenesis is minor, the depositional environment (and depositional rock types) as well as the expected rock properties derived from those depositional conditions will be good predictors of rock quality. However, if the reservoir rock has been subjected to significant diagenesis, the original rock properties present at deposition will be quite different than the current properties. More specifically, use of the depositional environment and the associated rock types (in isolation) to guide field development activities may result in ineffective exploitation. Introduction Unconventional natural gas resources — tight gas sands, naturally-fractured gas shales, and coalbed methane reservoirs — comprise a significant percentage of the North American natural gas resource base and these systems represent an important source for future reserve growth and production. Similar to conventional hydrocarbon systems, unconventional gas reservoirs are characterized by complex geological and petrophysical systems as well as heterogeneities — at all scales. However, unlike conventional reservoirs, unconventional gas reservoirs typically exhibit gas storage and flow characteristics which are uniquely tied to geology — deposition and diagenetic processes. As a result, effective resource exploitation requires a comprehensive reservoir description and characterization program to quantify gas-in-place and to identify those reservoir properties which control production. Although many unconventional natural gas resources are characterized by low permeabilities, this paper addresses only low-permeability sandstone reservoirs, i.e., tight gas sands.

AB  - Abstract The selection of proppant to provide highly conductive pathways in hydraulically generated fractures is typically based on the proppant crush strength, permeability, availability, and cost. Extensive libraries of laboratory determined conductivity values, obtained using API standardized methods at a variety of simulated well conditions, are available for most proppants. However, post-fracture stimulation well testing indicates that these values are often one to two orders of magnitude too high. In many fields, the productivity of fractures declines rapidly, requiring frequent re-stimulation treatments to remain economically viable. Proppant crushing and embedment, fracturing fluid damage, and fines invasion are proppant-pack permeability damage mechanisms that have been used to explain this loss of productivity. This paper reports on recent studies that have determined that aluminum-based proppant materials may promote geochemical reactions that can occur at a surprisingly rapid rate, even at moderate temperatures, resulting in the loss of porosity and permeability and the creation of fines in the proppant pack. The compatibilities of several man-made proppants ranging from lightweight ceramics to high-strength bauxites with a variety of formations are presented. These findings indicate that the formation mineralogy plays a heretofore unrecognized role in determining proppant suitability. Most proppants were found to lose 50-60% permeability before stabilizing, while others were shown to lose up to 90% in only a few days. This paper describes the specialized methods that were developed to study these geochemical reactions and reports quantitative changes in permeability, proppant composition, and fluid changes. Surface analysis using scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and energy dispersive X-ray (EDX) provides dramatic visual confirmation of this damage mechanism. Results of this study have a great potential economic significance, suggesting new, important fracture design parameters that need to be determined to enable choosing the appropriate proppant for maximized stimulation longevity. Introduction Hydraulic fracture stimulation is widely used to improve the economics of hydrocarbon production from a reservoir. In many of these fracture stimulations, the fractures are "propped open?? by leaving them filled with a high-permability pack of granular material (proppant) that provides a highly conductive pathway from the reservoir to the well. Much effort has gone into standardizing the selection of proppants to optimize stimulation cost against expected stimulation results. Many proppant materials are available, including natural sands, ceramics, sintered minerals, plastics, and composite materials. These are provided in a variety of sizes and size distributions and ranked based by their crush strength and conductivity at expected formation closure stress and temperature. Industry standard methods have been implemented to provide performance comparison of these materials. Cost and availablitity are additional constraints that impact the ultimate proppant selection. Standard methods (API RP 56; API RP 60; ISO 13503-2) for determining the crush strength of proppant include putting a carefully sieved and measured dry sample of proppant in a cell of specific dimensions and applying a pressure load for 2 minutes, then sieving the material to determine the percentage of crushed proppant. This method is not applicable to resin-coated proppants (RCP) and proppants that have been produced back after fracture treatments. API short-term conductivity is measured according to API RP 61(API RP 61, 1989). Proppants are loaded at a specified concentration (e.g. 2 lb/ft2) between two core slabs (e.g. Ohio Sandstone) in an API conductivity cell. The proppant pack conductivity is then measured at a stress level a few times until it stabilized (normally within only 50 hours) with less than 5% change for example (Fig. 1). However, it is common to observe continuous decline in conductivity, although less than 5% on a daily basis, if the measurement is carried longer than 2 days. It is rare that the system actually achieves equilibrium conductivity during that time, but the rate of change of conductivity does slow down.

AB  - AbstractRecent advances in biotechnology have led to the identification and isolation of polymer-specific enzymes. This new technology has been incorporated in the development of improved damage removal systems. The polymer specific reactivity of the new systems provides environmentally safe polymer degradation without causing damage to the formation or tubular goods. Polymer specific systems have been developed for removal of damage caused by polymers such as cellulose, guar, and starch. The treatments can be applied over a wide range of downhole conditions to polymeric damage resulting from fracturing, gravel packing, or workover operations. Fracture conductivity and core flow evaluations have shown that multi-fold improvements in permeability are achieved with the new systems. Damaged wells treated with the new systems have experienced up to three-fold improvement in well productivity. A detailed study and analysis of laboratory and field data are presented. IntroductionPolymeric damage to proppant pack and formation permeability can significantly decrease well production. The damage, in many cases, is due to insufficient degradation of drilling, completion, or stimulation fluids and the dynamically formed filter cake on the formation face. A filter cake is a dense, practically insoluble concentration of polymer deposited on the fracture face. The presence of filter cake may impede flow, dramatically reducing the productivity of the well. Several studies have shown that the concentration of polysaccharides within a filter cake can range from about 10 to greater than 25 times the surface polysaccharide concentration of the stimulation treatment. For instance, if a fracture treatment fluid contained an original polymer concentration of 40 pounds per thousand pounds (ppt), the filter-cake concentration could easily be 500 ppt. The obvious goal, therefore, exists to reduce or remove the polymeric damage in order to obtain the optimum productivity the stimulation treatment was intended to provide. STATEMENT OF THE PROBLEM Various methods have been used to remove damage in an effort to increase well productivity. Several previous studies describe the application of conventional cleanup treatments. P. 595^

AB  - Abstract The primary objectives of a gravel pack are preventing formation sand production, achieving high productivity, and providing completion longevity. For cased hole completions, inadequately filling the perforation tunnels with gravel is probably the main cause of formation damage which ultimately translates into a well that is completion limited since it produces below the capacity of the reservoir. Hence, performing prepacking operations that fill the perforations with undamaged gravel will usually enhance productivity. Aside from prepacking, effectively packing the casing-tubing annulus produces a stable, void-free gravel pack that will not settle or deteriorate with time. Gravel pack procedures were developed in the mid-1970's and subsequently optimized to address the above concerns. They consisted of preacidizing (if required) the formation followed by a prepack performed with lightly-gelled water pumped at matrix rates that filled the casing with gravel to the top of the perforations. After washing the prepack gravel from the casing, the gravel pack assembly was run and an annular gravel pack was performed using water as the transport fluid. This procedure provided two opportunities for gravel to prepack the perforations. Acidizing was subsequently performed to achieve the desired productivity. Well test data show that over 70% of the wells tested had skin factors that were less than 10 and many were in the zero range. Gravel pack failures were rare and over 95% of these completions produced to depletion without requiring a workover. More recently, enhanced prepacking has been performed by pumping at high rates and using water as the transport fluid. These treatments were designed to fracture the formation a distance of 5-10 ft from the well to bypass formation damage. The high rate prepacks have been performed with either the screen in place (single step) or prior to running the screen (two-step) in the well. In either case, the annular pack continued to be performed with water. The high rate completions have been performed at little or no incremental cost compared to those conducted at matrix rates since they were performed with platform-based, moderate horsepower equipment. The performance of these completions has been excellent. The need for post-completion acidizing and associated flowback concerns has been virtually eliminated. Wells clean up more rapidly, consistently have higher productivities, and appear to have improved completion success as compared to those performed at matrix rates. Introduction A myriad of procedures have been developed for gravel packing wells. The technique used is normally the consequence of operating conditions, economic constraints, personal preferences, and other reasons. An ideal gravel pack is one that yields the highest productivity, longest completion life, and controls the entry of formation sand into the well for the lowest cost. To achieve these objectives, procedures must be effective, as simple as possible, and field worthy.

AB  - Abstract The Bakken boom in North Dakota is currently focused on the Central Basin area where around half of the drilling rigs in North Dakota are now operating. What makes this area different compared to previous areas of Bakken development is that there is only minor structural variation and significantly less naturally induced fracturing as compared to the higher permeability rock facies that exist in the sub-reservoirs of earlier Bakken development such as at the Elm Coulee field in Montana or the Sanish and Parshall fields in North Dakota. As a consequence, the role of the well's completion and stimulation design has a greater significance and impact on well productivity and ultimate recovery. Different companies have taken very different approaches to well design using either plug and perf or ball and sleeve completions, and a variety of fracture designs with slickwater, hybrid or cross-linked gel fluids and a variety of proppants from 100% natural sand to 100% ceramics. As a consequence, it is not uncommon for different operators to have over a 2 million dollar difference in their AFE's solely because of the differences in approach to the well's completion and stimulation design. The authors have chosen to apply "advanced completion and stimulation designs?? which are designed to maximize the reservoir contact area (slickwater and plug and perf) and optimize the conductivity (ceramic proppant at relatively high volumes).1,2 In order to benchmark performance of its completion and stimulation program the authors in 2010 developed a production and completion database of all wells completed in the Central Basin using publicly available information from the North Dakota Industrial Commission's records augmented by additional completions information obtained directly from the operators. From an initial dataset of ~30 wells the database has been updated monthly and has now grown to over 1100 wells in the Central Basin from 28 operators. Benchmarking of completion performance has been performed using the above database together with a Petra geological database developed from all publicly available logs in the Central Basin (~500 vertical wells which had been drilled and logged prior to the first Bakken horizontal well). Benchmarking of performance is somewhat subjective in the Bakken (as well as most reservoirs) due to variations in reservoir quality. Without geological input (reservoir quality), the acquired data were too scattered to achieve meaningful correlations to completion methods unless the area was limited to ensure similar reservoir quality for the wells being evaluated. By narrowing the analysis to very limited areas; this also reduced the input as to the number and type of completion methods being compared. Multivariate analysis methods, that included geological input, were used to benchmark performance over most of the Williston Central Basin, allowing comparison of the varied completion methods for 28 operators and over a thousand wells. Using multiple parameters an excellent correlation for completion methodology versus reservoir quality was obtained. While early analysis focused on 30, 60 and 90-day cumulative production; in the past year there have been enough wells to generate performance metrics based on 180 and 365-day cumulative production since over 600 wells have now been on production for at least a year.

AB  - ABSTRACTHorizontal wells have shown such gains in productivity in many applications that the damage associated with longtime exposure to drilling fluid was, in many cases, accepted. In addition, the difficulty of removing formation damage in a horizontal well has compounded the problem. With many horizontal wells now being left in an openhole status, formation damage becomes even more important.Coiled tubing (CT) drilling has grown from four jobs in 1991 to over 120 (estimated) jobs in 1994. The primary motivations for this growth have been:The ability of CT drilling to finish drilling a well in soft formations faster than a rotary rig, andSafe, rigless underbalanced drilling to greatly reduce formation damage in horizontal wells.This paper reviews the causes of formation damage, both from fluid/solids invasion and stimulation techniques to remove damage.An analytical model is used to estimate the productivity index (PI) for various horizontal and vertical permeabilities, well lengths, and reservoir thicknesses for comparison with results from several case studies.Options for underbalanced drilling including fluid selection, gas lift, and seal technology are discussed. Candidate selection criteria for those evaluating the possibility of underbalanced horizontal drilling are presented.INTRODUCTIONHorizontal wells are particularly vulnerable to formation damage due to long drilling mud exposure time relative to vertical wells (easily 30 times) and reduced cleanup velocity (easily 1/5) with production spread over the long horizontal. In spite of this, horizontal wells are the most important success story in the oil business in the last 10 years.Average gains in productivity1,2,3,4 of two to seven times the vertical wells in reservoirs with matrix permeability have fueled the growth of horizontal drilling. In reservoirs with natural fracture, productivity indices of 20 to 30 times the vertical have been observed with ultimate recovery several times greater than for vertical wells.5 Ultimate recovery improvement with matrix permeability is not widely reported, although 1.5 to 2 times vertical ultimate recovery is expected in two Canadian reservoirs. Although the ultimate recovery may not be improved, the accelerated production often makes horizontal wells more economically attractive in spite of the higher cost of the average horizontal well which is 1.2 to 2 times the vertica.3

AB  - SummaryForeign fluids and/or entrained solids introduced during various phases of well development reduce the intrinsic reservoir productivity by phases of well development reduce the intrinsic reservoir productivity by blocking the effective flow path. Oil/gas recoveries, therefore, can be enhanced significantly if better quality control is established for all well treatment fluids by assessing rock/fluid and fluid/fluid compatibilities before field use. A capillary-pressure method, developed for evaluating the formation damage or stimulation potential of well treatment fluids, uses relative changes in pore-entry pressure, shape of the capillary-pressure curve, and residual wetting-phase saturations as measures of damage or stimulation in core plugs exposed to various treatment fluids.IntroductionDrainage gas/water or oil/water capillary-pressure data were generated in the laboratory on Berea sandstone and field core samples with prior exposures to completion, drilling, and injection fluids, and acids by use of the ultracentrifuge. The data showed that (1) capillary pressures and residual wetting-phase saturations increased in damaged samples; (2) damaged samples showed higher entry pressures, hence lower pore-throat radius; (3) clay-stabilized samples had lower capillary pressures and lower residual saturations; (4) effective acid stimulation with adequate overflush resulted in lower entry pressure, higher pore-throat radius, and lower residual saturations; and (5) samples acidized without overflush had higher capillary pressures. These results can be useful to field operators and laboratory researchers involved in the design and screening of well treatment fluids for field application. The technique is particularly useful for optimizing acid and clay stabilizer concentrations for various reservoir lithologies. Most important, the technique not only compliments the more time-consuming dynamic-return permeability tests but also provides insights into the mechanism of damage or stimulation. It has long been recognized that formation damage in reservoir sands arises from either the blockage of near-wellbore pores by produced reservoir particulates or the exposure of the formation to foreign fluids that are incompatible with the reservoir minerals. These fluids, introduced during all phases of the well development, react adversely with the formation clays and cause impairment and loss of reservoir productivity. Therefore, evaluating the formation damage/stimulation potential of fluids before fluid application by using dynamic core flow (return permeability) tests is routine. These tests can, at times, be prohibitively expensive and time-consuming, especially if several fluid samples and different reservoir lithologies are involved.

This paper presents an alternate explanation. paper presents an alternate explanation. Gravel may be flushed from perforations during acidizing into acidized formation voids, gravel may move into acidized gravel pack voids in the screen-casing annulus during production start-up, or tunnel voids may have existed prior to acidizing as a result of poor gravel placement during gravel pack execution. placement during gravel pack execution. Production start-up rate controls how Production start-up rate controls how formation sand enters partially filled voids after acidizing. A controlled production rate allows formation sand to production rate allows formation sand to enter the tunnel above the gravel so that a more conductive parallel alignment of sand and gravel in the tunnel is created. IntroductionGravel packing technology has improved dramatically in the last 15 years. This focus on improvement was generated by poor well performance compared to formation potential after proration controls were potential after proration controls were removed in times of oil shortage. Early models focused attention on the pressure drop caused by flow through gravel packed tunnels in inside-casing gravel packs and pointed out the effects of turbulent flow pointed out the effects of turbulent flow (or visco inertial flow) at high velocities through these gravel packed tunnels (refs. 1-4). Gelled water systems were developed and studied for more effective placement of gravel. Improvement in gravel sizing and gravel quality control led to improved performance, especially after sufficient performance, especially after sufficient perforated area was created by using larger perforated area was created by using larger diameter perforations. Nodal analysis focused attention on the selection of shot density and hole diameter. On site quality control also enhanced productivity. Even with improved perforation cleaning, formation damage was still encountered after placement of gravel packs. During all this development damaged gravel packs were acidized to improve performance. packs were acidized to improve performance. Often wells responded favorably and then declined rather quickly after acidizing. Other wells responded and maintained good performance through use of special acid performance through use of special acid systems and controlled production rate. Yet sometimes different wells responded well to regular acid systems and poorly to special acid systems. Acidized well performance improved gradually with better job planning, execution, quality control and planning, execution, quality control and improved acid placement. Because of the variability of acid response, a study was undertaken to better understand the response of inside casing gravel packs to acid. Wells were examined to see how damage was caused and why acid did or did not work. One finding was that after good quality gravel pack placement, extreme damage still occurred that could not be explained satisfactorily by damage to the gravel in the tunnels. This damage could reasonably be modeled by damage in the formation sand adjacent to the gravel packed tunnels. A model incorporating this packed tunnels. A model incorporating this effect assumed hemispherical flow through the formation to the gravel packed tunnel entrance. P. 137

AB  - AbstractHorizontal wells can be stimulated by the creation of a number of hydraulic fractures along the wellbore. if the well is drilled in the direction of the minimum horizontal stress, a series of transverse hydraulic fractures will be induced. The limited communication between such transverse fractures and the wellbore creates a choking effect near the well and causes an apparent reduction in fracture conductivity. Methods to estimate the effect of the limited communication between the wellbore and the fracture based on Darcy flow of fluid in the fractures have been recently reported. Such methods, however, should not be applied to gas reservoirs since non-Darcy flow effects within the fracture may significantly influence well performance, particularly as the degree of communication performance, particularly as the degree of communication between the fracture and the wellbore is reduced. This study considers the effect that non-Darcy flow within the hydraulic fractures has on horizontal well productivity in tight gas reservoirs. Well performance was simulated with semi-analytical models and by numerical simulation. The effect of fracture and reservoir properties of gas well productivity is discussed, and various development productivity is discussed, and various development options for tight gas reservoirs are compared. IntroductionThe use of horizontal wells for exploiting oil and gas reservoirs is now firmly established within the industry. A survey of worldwide drilling activity reported plans for over 4500 horizontal wells in 1990. Although most of the horizontal well drilling to date has centred on oil reservoirs, interest in applying it to gas reservoirs is increasing. Horizontal gas wells in Alberta, Appalachian Basin (W. Virginia) and North Sea reservoirs have been recently reported. Of particularly interest are low-permeability gas reservoirs in which economic flow rates can normally be achieved only through hydraulic fracturing of the formation. Studies on the tight, naturally fractured Sole Pit area and tight gas reservoirs in general have Pit area and tight gas reservoirs in general have demonstrated that a horizontal well can outperform a hydraulically fractured vertical well. Furthermore, the orientation of the horizontal well can be controlled, whereas that of a hydraulic fracture depends on the stress prevalent regime present. prevalent regime present. Stimulation of a horizontal well in a low-permeability reservoir may further increase well productivity. Unlike a vertical well, a horizontal well may be fractured at more than one point along the well length. Multiply fractured horizontal wells (MFHWs) have been successfully applied by Maersk in oil reservoirs in tight chalk. The productivity increase resulting from multiple hydraulic fracture treatments along a horizontal well in a gas reservoir in naturally fractured shale can be 7 times greater than that achieved for stimulated vertical wells. The use of MFHWs in the development of coal-bed methane has also been recently studied. P. 133

AB  - AbstractThe productivity of many gas condensate wells is reduced by the formation of a condensate bank in the near-well region. Forecasting of gas condensate well productivity usually requires fine-grid numerical simulation to model the formation of the condensate bank, and to account for high-velocity phenomena such as non-Darcy flow and changes in relative permeability at large capillary numbers.This paper presents a new technique for forecasting performance of gas condensate wells, using simpler techniques, which can be used in a spreadsheet. The calculation uses a material balance model for reservoir depletion and a two-phase pseudopressure integral for well inflow performance. The pseudopressure integral technique has been extended to include high-velocity effects and also to allow for the change in produced fluid composition due to the formation of the condensate bank.The new technique has been tested by comparison with the results of fine-grid compositional simulation, and the results are in good agreement for a wide range of cases covering vertical, horizontal and hydraulically fractured wells. The spreadsheet model provides a useful tool for rapid forecasts of condensate well performance, for examining the effects of condensate blockage in different well types or for studying sensitivities. It is also valuable where simple models of condensate reservoir performance are required for use in integrated studies involving issues such as surface facilities, drilling schedules and gas sales contracts.IntroductionWell productivity is an important issue in the development of most low and medium permeability gas condensate reservoirs. However, accurate forecasts of productivity can be difficult because of the need to understand and account for the complex processes that occur in the near-well region.When the well pressure falls below the dew point, a region of high liquid saturation builds up around the well, impairing the flow of gas and reducing productivity. It is essential to take account of this ‘condensate blockage' effect when calculating well productivity.Most of the drawdown to a condensate well occurs close to the wellbore, where gas velocities may be very high, and the relationship between flow rate and pressure drop may be complicated by two additional phenomena. The increase in mobility at high capillary number1,2,3,4, sometimes referred to as ‘positive coupling' or ‘viscous stripping'. Inertial or non-Darcy flow.In most gas condensate wells the net effect of the two high-velocity phenomena is to improve productivity, reducing the impairment due to condensate blockage, and it is important to include these high-velocity effects when simulating gas condensate well performance. The importance of high-velocity effects has been demonstrated by history matching results for a number of wells, where it was only possible to obtain a satisfactory match when high-velocity effects were included in the simulation model5,6.Well Productivity CalculationsThe most accurate way of calculating gas condensate well productivity is by fine-grid numerical simulation, either in single-well models with a fine grid near to the well, or in full field models using local grid refinement. A fine-grid model will allow for high-velocity effects to be modeled, and most commercial simulators now include options to account for inertial flow and the increase in mobility at high capillary number.While numerical simulation is suitable for detailed forecasting of reservoir behaviour, there are many applications where this level of modeling is not justified, and simpler engineering calculations are more appropriate.Simpler calculations are particularly useful to provide rapid forecasts of well deliverability, for sensitivity studies to assess the impact of parameters such as relative permeability or PVT properties, or to estimate the benefits of fractured or horizontal wells. They may also be more appropriate where accurate data on reservoir, fluid or rock properties are not available.

AB  - Abstract Expandable sand screens are a globally accepted sand control system with more than 600 installations worldwide across all vendors. A growing body of data suggests that when compliantly expanded in openhole they perform very well, with consistently low skins and high PIs. Where comparisons have been done, the expandable screens perform at least as well as other sand exclusion systems such as standalone screens and openhole gravel packs. There are a number of possible reasons for the high performance: 1) The ESS presents a large open area to the formation. This gives a low pressure drop across the screen and minimizes the possibility of plugging to a minimum. 2) The compliant expansion into contact with the wellbore limits the zone of deformation around the hole. 3) Compliance also improves filter cake clean up by reducing mixing with failed sand. The effect of compliance has been investigated in two sets of experiments. The first was full scale test with a compliant expandable screen and a stand alone screen with an annulus. The expandable showed 60% higher productivity than the screen with an annulus. The second set of experiments was in a specially designed Perspex cell. This cell allowed the effect of an annulus to be investigated for a variety of different sands from well sorted to poorly sorted. The results show that the compliant screen has advantages in sand retention and 100% greater productivity. Taken as a whole, the field results and the two types of experiment show in a very clear way the benefits on productivity of compliant sand screens. Introduction The first expandable sand screen (ESS®1) was installed in 1997. Since then there has been a rapid uptake of the technology with 600+ installs to date over all vendors. There are 2 systems, a type based on a slotted basepipe and a type based on a perforated basepipe Figure 1. Both systems have their advantages and disadvantages. The slotted base pipe system has been the most used with over 550 applications to date. The installations have covered all regions of the world and a wide variety of application types. They have been installed in oil and gas wells, water wells, water and gas injectors and gas storage wells. Typically for the slotted base pipe type the applications have been in challenging environments from the point of view of uniformity and fines content, weak and unconsolidated sands. Table 1, shows an overview of the operating range and statistics of ESS. Shell International holds the original patents for the ESS. When it was first envisaged, it was conceived to have the borehole support of a gravel pack with the operational efficiency of a conventional well screen. It was also designed to have a high productivity relative to other sand control options. In essence the ESS was planned to deliver wells with greater return on investment than wells completed with conventional sand control systems. Saudi Aramco is the world's second largest user of ESS technology. A usage chart is shown in Figure 2. The prime drivers for the Saudi Aramco installations are high productivity, ability to immobilize shale streaks too small and numerous to isolate using conventional mechanical techniques and ability to subsequently isolate sources of unwanted water production.

AB  - Abstract A near-uniform well (production) inflow or (injection) outflow profile delays early water breakthrough and further decreases water cut which results in higher oil recovery. Field experience has shown that wells producing from, or injecting into, multiple layers and/or reservoirs benefit from an Inflow Control Device (ICD) completion's ability to reduce the in/out-flow imbalance along its length. The standard ICD completion design workflow involves selection of the "strength" of the ICD's restriction based on the incomplete knowledge of the reservoir that is available prior to drilling the well with several commercial softwares available for this. However, more complete reservoir data becomes available once the drilled completion zone has been logged and the data analysed. There follows a short period of time during which the engineer must judge whether the planned ICD completion design is "fit-for-purpose" or needs further consideration. The availability of a rapid ICD completion design methodology that does not require access to computationally demanding commercial software would be highly beneficial at this time. This paper presents a workflow which meets the above requirements. It extends our previous analytical approach to ICD sizing to directly relate the uniform-strength ICD completion design to the predicted heterogeneity of the open-hole inflow profile together with the consequent loss in well productivity from the ICD's flow restriction. The workflow combines a series of dimensionless, universal type curves and analytical solutions in a relatively simple and fast process to find the desired ICD design. A new completion design can be made immediately after drilling has been completed to provide the desired level of inflow variation from the latest predicted level of reservoir and fluid inflow heterogeneity determined by a "quick-look" evaluation of the well's log data. The same design procedure can be used to select ICD completion designs that are a compromise between two competing objectives: increasing the uniformity of the inflow profile and minimising the reduction of the well's productivity index that results from the extra pressure losses imposed by the ICDs. Two typical examples of the workflow's application are provided. The first one examines whether it is necessary to change the ICD completion design when drilling problems result in a reduction of the well's completion length. The second example evaluates the impact of the actual reservoir permeability profile being more heterogeneous than originally expected. The workflow's design philosophy was confirmed by commercial numerical simulators recommending the same ICD completion design in both cases. This work extends our earlier analytical approach to ICD sizing. This new ICD completion design workflow can be used by completion design engineers to rapidly analyse uniform-strength ICD completion design options and their consequences on well inflow performance without expensive computational resources. The underlying principles, assumptions and application area of the analytical model are fully discussed in the paper.

AB  - Abstract: Well productivity in unconventional reservoirs depends on contacting good reservoir quality rock with sufficient surface area, via hydraulic fracturing, and more importantly on preserving surface area and fracture conductivity over long-term production. Thus, understanding the created fracture system is fundamental for understanding well production. In this paper we present fracture propagation experiments on texturally complex, organic-rich, tight shale outcrop blocks of the Niobrara formation. After hydraulically fracturing the block we conducted unpropped fracture conductivity measurements under changing closure stress. Subsequently we re-fractured the block with proppant laden slick water. When the desired amount of sand was transported and just before screening out, we stopped proppant injection and conducted fracture conductivity measurements on the propped fracture. These measurements of propped and unpropped fracture conductivity were compared to corresponding measurements on small samples. Results show that the larger fractures, whether propped or unpropped, retain higher fracture conductivity with increasing stress. We also observe substantial fracture complexity associated with the textural complexity in the rock. As a result there is substantial variability in the concentration and distribution of the proppant in the fracture. Post-test analysis allowed us to describe the fractured system as consisting of four easily identifiable regions: the wellbore, the connection between the wellbore and the fracture system, the near-wellbore fracture, and the far-wellbore fracture network. Understanding the role of each of these regions to hydrocarbon production helps identifying the often competing causes of production decline over time. Results show that the requirements for optimizing hydrocarbon flow in these four regions are different, but reasonable compromises can be made to sustain production from the overall fracture system.

AB  - Abstract Located in eastern Venezuela, the Furrial field is composed of three main reservoirs. Reservoir characteristics include 8,300 million barrels of original oil in place and a hydrocarbon column consisting of crude with asphaltenes that vary from 10 to 30° API. The field has 147 active wells, of which 45 are water-injector wells and seven are gas-injector wells. Wells drilled in the area range from approximately 12,000 to 17,000 ft. Crude oil with asphaltenic tar mats (because of its chemical features) was identified in the field, which establishes a vertical structural seal bordering traditional reservoirs. Major problems in the reservoirs include emulsions, paraffin and asphaltene plugging, water cuts, and water channeling. For several years, the operator has been developing a program to convert wells that cannot be produced naturally to gas-lift wells (conventional, tubing punch, and coiled lift) to increase recovery potential. Although the system is a single, economic, and fast-lifting system, it requires a continuous flow of high-pressure gas. The productivity workflow presented in this paper required a multidisciplinary team to analyze, select, and rank recommended well candidates for intervention and production optimization, evaluating all aspects pertaining to well productivity and reserves to objectively identify possible alternatives for increasing production. The process produced a list of wells ranked by their potential to increase production. The intervention plan for the wells were then defined and ranked based on technical and economic criteria. This paper presents the successful application of this methodology in a mature field in the Venezuelan Oriente Basin and demonstrates how the method impacted and improved well productivity in this field by over 27 times more than the base case.

AB  - Abstract The Barnett Shale success in the 90's has led to a significant amount of focused work on fracturing and its related aspects. The work included understanding its nuances, to be able to design the treatments better, and pump them with enhanced efficiency. Production from these completed wells is highly dependent on both the characteristics of proppants being placed, as well as those of the reservoir being treated. Fracturing leads to an interaction between the minerals of the proppants, formation and the fluids. Incompatible chemical interactions between minerals of the proppants, formation and fracturing fluids lead to precipitations which reduce porosity. Under in-situ conditions, these interactions further facilitate the phenomenon of geo-chemical diagenesis as a result of which rapid loss of fracture conductivity is observed. The diagenesis process includes mechanisms such as diffusion, temperature induced dissolution, precipitation in the pore space, along with chemical reactions at the fracture surface. These mechanisms lead to a reduction in the width and hence, the permeability of the created fracture. Proppant pack permeability reduction is presented in this paper through a mathematical model, which simulates fluid-mineral reactions in the created hydraulic fracture. The model involves solving the diffusion and precipitation equations for each component to simulate the changing porosity and permeability over time. These coded partial differential equations are combined with the reactions occurring at the surface. Further, this work studies the impact of this reduction on the productivity of a well completed in shale reservoir, followed by a sensitivity study of critical parameters. This work will help in a better understanding of reactions occurring within the fractures and their effect on the loss of fracture conductivity. With India looking at developing its shale plays, this work also includes possible issues that could affect this development.

AB  - AbstractVery permeable depleted formations are usually subject to high fluid losses during drilling and completion operations which can lead to formation damage, long clean up times and higher operating costs; these situations are compounded when underreaming and gravel packing are also required.Lost Circulation Materials (LCM) are often used to limit the fluid losses, but these materials can introduce even greater damage than the permeability impairment caused by excessive fluid loss into the formation.The selection of the fluid for drilling the producing zone is therefore critical for the success of the completion in order to achieve high performance and reduce the overall operational costs.A new, non-damaging, water based Drill-In Fluid (DIF) containing a blend of polymers and sized calcium carbonate was identified by an extensive laboratory study to be the most suitable fluid for the drilling and underreaming operations in a well located in the Ionian Sea, southern Italy.The new DIF was field tested in this subsea well where a depleted and very permeable sand layer had to be completed with an Open Hole Gravel Pack (OHGP).All phases of the completion operations proceed as planned and no fluid losses were recorded before or alter the gravel pack operations in accordance with laboratory results; clean up was rapid and no matrix stimulation treatment was necessary.The investment for this DIF was recovered during the clean up phase, since the rig time actually required for this operation was two days less than planned.The expected productivity was quickly obtained and consequently the same procedures were applied to two other wells in the same area, where the effectiveness of the new DIF has been confirmed.This paper reviews the results of the laboratory study and the experience gained during the last two years in drilling and completing depleted highly permeable sands; guidelines are established for future applications of DIF in similar reservoirs, particularly where an OHGP has to be installed.IntroductionThe drilling and completion of depleted sands formations has widespread interest. Losses of mud or filtrate can introduce a non-removable damage especially in high permeability reservoirs where the invasion can extend up to and even exceed 10 ft.The usual choice made by the industry in these cases is to add removable LCM to the drilling fluid in an effort to control losses and reduce the invasion radius. Unfortunately, this procedure very often calls for a matrix stimulation after the completion phase either in cased or open hole situations.In open hole completions, the best option would be to use a drilling fluid which builds a very thin filter cake capable of withstanding a high overbalance and having a very low Lift Off Pressure (LOP).Moreover, if an OHGP is the selected completion, the filter cake left at the formation-gravel interface should not damage the gravel pack and the particles created on disaggregation of the filter cake during the clean up of the well should be able to pass through the gravel bed. A thin filter cake will produce a smaller quantity of particles and therefore reduce the risk of damage leading to a higher probability of obtaining a high performance OHGP.An extensive laboratory study was planned and carried out to evaluate the various DIFs available on the market and to identify the most suitable fluid having the previously described characteristics.The selected DIF was used to drill and underream a high permeability depleted formation in a well located in the southern offshore area of Italy. The first successful application of this DIF as well as two further applications in a similar reservoir in the same area are reported in this paper.P. 145^

AB  - Abstract A novel timer activated sandface valve was developed that has significant impact on wellbore productivity by enabling improved wellbore clean up, particularly in high angle and open hole completions. This technology has been field trialled and proven in three wells in a North Sea field. The tool was developed from concept to installation in less than nine months including detailed engineering review and assurance. Negative impact to productivity due to inefficient wellbore clean up of high angle completions is a common situation for production wells. The current solution can be complex completion architecture or extensive clean up procedures that are both expensive and difficult to implement. The consequence of a poor clean up can be loss in well productivity, access to reserves or a requirement to sidetrack the well. Poor clean up was observed in several wells in a North Sea field. The wells exhibited high skin and no flow from the toe sections of the well due to the dominance of high productive intervals subject to high drawdown at the heel of the well. The timer activated sand face valve was developed with the key objective to deliver sequential clean up from the toe of the reservoir section without intervention or incremental rig time. The valves also deliver the functionality of a sliding side door for future water shut-off capability along the well bore. The paper will present an overview of the technical challenge, detail development of the tool and processes used for assurance and include results of the field trial. The valve development combines a field proven timer activation mechanism with conventional sliding sleeve technology. The tool was developed without incremental resource and cost often required for product development utilising specifically designed lean technical assurance tools and failure mode and effects analysis processes. The result is a successfully field proven completion tool that is the basis for a new completion technique that has application in high angle wells in all oilfield applications. Introduction The project to design, develop, manufacture and install a novel timer activated valve was initiated in response to poor clean up observed in wells drilled in a North Sea development. Flow contribution from wells drilled in the field had been restricted to small sections of the wellbore. This was determined by pressure transient analysis and confirmed by results of production logging. The flow was shown to be coming predominantly from the heel of the well and in some cases the flowing length was less than 20% of the overall reservoir section drilled. Log data acquired during drilling, and data gathered from offset appraisal wells showed that the wells were capable of producing from the entire section. Considerable value in terms of increased production and reservoir access could be gained if the wells could be designed or modified to increase the flowing interval. Analysis of conventional and established techniques for improving clean up in open hole wells was undertaken. Poor clean up of high angle wells, particularly with open hole completions is common. Despite poor clean up, the wells drilled in the field were high rate producers. The aim was to establish the most cost effective method of increasing the flowing interval without risking base production. Remedial techniques were also investigated and a trial was conducted of most appropriate selected intervention. This was not successful in improving production and resulted in a collapsed wellbore.

AB  - AbstractThis paper describes a method of sand consolidation and channel repairing by using a Resin system, the system comprises of a resin (a mixture of elastomers UF, MF and a suitable plasticizer) and a hardener (a mixture of two mild Lewis Acids). The hardener controls curing time. The role of plasticizer is to impart flexibility and impact resistance to otherwise brittle natured UF-MF resin. Surface bonding between Sand and resin has been enhanced with a special additive, if required.This paper also describes a methodology of placing a chemical casing during or after drilling a caving prone shale zone, strong enough to prevent sloughing of shale and withstands mechanical shocks during drilling, which would facilitate drilling with reduced mud weight and without reduction of hole size.Experimental results on resin development and mechanical parameters of sand consolidation and Chemical casing of different mineralogy have been presented. The compressive strength of the consolidated sand and shale is found to be extremely high to withstand the overburden pressure and mechanical impacts during drilling. The designed application methodology is described in detail.This system would be extremely economic as it can be applied directly after perforation if required, saving rig time and reducing completion cost compared to Gravel pack, liner placement and Screens, with the added advantage of no hole size reduction and better sand consolidation as compared to other methods. The developed chemical system is 1/3 the cost of epoxy resins, reported earlier for similar application and the components are environment friendly and easy to handle because of their water solubility.INTRODUCTION[1] [3] [4][7] [12] [14]In sandstone reservoir one of the most common well problems faced by operators is sand production problem. Every year, well cleaning and work-over operations, related to sand production, cost the industry millions of dollars. Additional expenses associated with sand production include pump maintenance, well cleaning, disposal of dirty sands, etc and if we talk about caving shell is the most trouble making which is incidentally the cap rock for most of the sandstone oil reservoir. Due to presence of clay minerals in compacted form as the major component and particularly when the clay is of high swelling nature e.g. Montmorillonite the shale starts swelling when comes in contact with aqueous drilling fluid filtrate and when swelling pressure exceeds fluid column head pressure it detach from the matrix and falls, this phenomenon is known as ‘caving'. The caving phenomenon in drilling is highly unwanted due to its various detrimental effects such as stuck pipe, bit-balling etc. These problems seriously affect the drilling velocity and well quality, and raise the drilling cost and even loss of hole. The cost arisen from wellbore instability in shales has been estimated conservatively to be in the order of magnitude of US$500 million per year. Shales, which swell upon contacting water, are often referred to as heaving or sloughing shales. Such shales upon contact with aqueous drilling fluids swell and fracture rendering the well bore wall unstable. In such cases, the well bore wall sloughs into the well bore. Sloughing of shale and other similar unstable materials into the well bore can cause the drill string to become stuck and can enlarge the well bore resulting in large subterranean cavities. Such problems are frequently attributed to mud shale chemical interaction.Unstable wellbores occur when formation pressures exceed the pressure exerted by the drilling fluid. Two situations can produce such a condition: (a) the wellbore fluid pressure is lower than the insitu formation pressure and (b) the insitu formation pressure increases because of water adsorption and similarly problems like water channeling is also caused due to several factors like poor cement bond, cement channeling, improper cleaning of hole prior to placement, old and aged cement often develops interconnecting fractures, caverns formed by sand production, channel in formation, natural fissures, hydraulic fractures, and frequent stimulation in the near wellbore.

AB  - This literature review summarizes the theory and application of chelating agents in acidizing both carbonate and sandstone formations, and in hydraulic fracturing. The objective of this work is to explain the key role that chelating agents play in stimulation. This paper reviews results that were obtained through various laboratory tests, which aid in understanding chelating agent interactions with formation rock and fluids. Results were obtained through the following tests: coreflooding, corrosion tests, compatibility, Inductively Coupled Plasma (ICP), Environmental Scanning Electron Microscope (ESEM) and X-Ray Diffraction (XRD). At high temperatures, conventional acids such as HCl show severe corrosion, lack of penetration and sludging characteristics. Several organic acids were proposed in the reviewed literature to solve these issues. However, even organic acids result in solubility and incompatibility issues. Based on these shortcomings, chelating agents are often used and show good dissolving power, low corrosion, low sludging tendencies, excellent iron control, and some are highly degradable and environmentally friendly. In addition to acidizing, chelating agents allow for the application of saline water fracturing because of their water-softening properties. They also contribute to high-temperature water fracturing through delayed chelation of both the crosslinker and breaker. This work summarizes the applications of chelating agents in the stimulation sector. Over 100 papers were reviewed, including the latest developments and field applications of this technology. Readers can easily expand on this paper to further explore the wide range of applications chelating agents can offer the oil and gas industry.

AB  - AbstractWaterblocking due to invasion of completion fluids has been suspected to reduce gas well deliverability.1-5 However, this effect has not been quantified. We report results of a laboratory program to measure the waterblocking effect in core samples from a gas field. These data were mapped to a wellbore model to make deliverability predictions.The laboratory data consist of gas flow rate as a function of injected gas pore volume for various liquids (brine, methanol, toluene, isopropyl alcohol, and brine-methanol mixtures) at two saturation states (fully saturated with liquid, and containing liquid and trapped gas). We injected over 10 000 PV of gas in each test to mimic near well bore conditions. The data showed that the liquid displacement regime was followed by a mass transfer regime.The wellbore model had a time varying skin to account for the cleanup of the fluid invaded ("waterblocked") region. Clean up occurs as gas flows past this high liquid saturated region and removes liquid by displacement and mass transfer. We used the laboratory data to relate the reduced permeability of this region to pore volumes of gas throughout.We find that any loss in gas well deliverability recovers in two phases. The first phase corresponds to fluid displacement ("flowback period") and lasts for a few days at most. The second phase is slower and can last several months. Here evaporation causes the deliverability to slowly increase. It is in this regime that adding volatile fluids, such as methanol, to the completion brines has advantages.IntroductionPoor gas flow performance following well operations such as completions and workovers was recently observed in some wells in a gas field. Loss of aqueous fluids during these operations causes a ring of high water saturation around the wellbore. This can potentially reduce gas flow into the well, and this phenomenon is called "Waterblocking." The objectives of our work were to assess the impact of waterblocking on well deliverability and to evaluate remediation possibilities.Waterblocking has been suspected to reduce deliverability of gas reservoirs.1-5 Bennon et.al.1 and Cimolai et. al.2 saturation is significantly less than "irreducible" water saturation. They present two field case studies to advocate their claims. The first case study is on the Paddy formation in Central Alberta (k~100 md; f=15% Sw (in situ)=17%; Swirr(lab)=14%) The second is on the Cadomin formation in Alberta (k~1md; f=5%; Sw(in situ)=20%; Swirr(lab)=52%). Metheven3 discusses the performance of gas wells in the Frio and Wilcox formations in Texas. His data show that oil based drilling fluids lead to significant improvements in gas productivity compared to water based muds or invert emulsions. Laboratory tests indicate return permeability to gas after exposure to muds to be higher for oil-base mud compared to water-based mud. Metheven suggests water blocking and vaporization of oil base filtrate by gas production as reasons for these differences at the laboratory as well as field scale. Holditch4 presents a numerical study of formation damage around a hydraulic fracture in a tight gas sand reservoir. He makes an interesting observation that formation damage can increase the capillary pressure of a rock and this synergetic effect could lead to waterblock problems. Abrams and Vinegar5 use Computed Tomography to image the flow of nitrogen and brine in microdarcy gas sand cores. They claim that waterblock is unimportant if the drawdown pressure gradient in the region near a hydraulic fracture is of the order of several hundred psi/inch. Stimulation using alcohol or surfactants did not significantly imiprove gas flow in these cores. On the other hand, MacLeod6 claims aqueous stimulation fluids containing alcohol have proven to be highly successful in stimulating gas production from problem wells in sandstone formations.

AB  - Streamline-based methods, as repeatedly demonstrated in multiple applications, offer a robust and elegant framework for reconciling high-resolution geologic models with observed field responses. However, significant challenges persist with the application of streamline-based methods in complex grids and dual-permeability media due to the difficulty with streamline tracing in these systems. In this work, we propose a novel and efficient framework that circumvents these challenges by avoiding explicit tracing of streamlines but exploits the inherent desirable features of streamline-based production data integration in high-resolution geologic models. Our approach features the application of flow diagnostics to inverse problems involving the integration of multiphase production data in reservoir models. Here, time-of-flight as well as numerical tracer concentrations for each well, based on a defined flux field, are computed on the native finite volume grid. The information embedded in these metrics are utilized in the dynamic definition of stream-bundles and, eventually, in the computation of analytical water arrival time sensitivities with respect to model properties. This calculation mimics the streamline-derived analytical sensitivity computation utilized in the well-established Generalized Travel Time Inversion (GTTI) technique but precludes explicit streamline tracing. The reservoir model property field is updated iteratively by solving the LSQR system composed of the computed analytical sensitivity and the optimal water travel time shift, augmented with regularization and smoothness constraints. The power and efficacy of our approach are demonstrated using synthetic model and field applications. We first validate our approach by benchmarking with the streamline-based GTTI algorithm involving a single-permeability medium. The flow-diagnostics-derived analytical sensitivities were observed to show good agreement with the streamline-derived sensitivities in terms of correctly capturing relevant spatio-temporal trends. Furthermore, the desirable quasi-linear behavior characteristic of the traditional streamline-based GTTI technique was preserved. The flow-diagnostics-based inversion technique is then applied to a field-scale problem involving the integration of multiphase production data into a dual-permeability model of a large naturally fractured reservoir. The results clearly demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach in overcoming the limitations of classical streamline-based methods with dual-permeability systems. By construction, this approach finds direct application in single/multi-continuum models with generic grid designs, both in structured and fully unstructured formats, thereby aiding well-level history matching and high-resolution updates of modern geologic models. This work presents, for the first time, an application of the Generalized Travel Time Inversion (GTTI) to dual-permeability models of naturally fractured reservoirs. This is facilitated by a simplified, yet effective approach to travel time sensitivity computations directly on finite volume grids. The proposed approach can be easily applied to subsurface models at levels of complexity identified as challenging for classical streamline-based methods.

AB  - SummaryAccurate forecasting of gas-condensate-well productivity usually requires fine-grid numerical simulation to model the formation of the condensate bank and to account for high-velocity phenomena such as non-Darcy flow and changes in relative permeability at high capillary number.This paper presents a new technique for forecasting the performance of gas-condensate wells, using simpler techniques that can be used in a spreadsheet. The calculation uses a material-balance model for reservoir depletion and a two-phase pseudopressure integral for well inflow performance. The pseudopressure-integral technique has been extended to include high-velocity effects and to allow for the change in produced-fluid composition caused by the formation of the condensate bank.The new technique has been tested by comparison with the results of fine-grid compositional simulation, and the results are in good agreement for a wide range of cases covering vertical, horizontal, and hydraulically fractured wells.The spreadsheet-model approach provides a useful tool for rapid forecasts of condensate-well performance, for examining the effects of condensate blockage in different well types, or for studying sensitivities. It is also valuable where simple models of condensate-reservoir performance are required for use in integrated studies involving issues such as surface facilities, drilling schedules, and gas sales contracts.IntroductionWell productivity is an important issue in the development of most low- and medium-permeability gas-condensate reservoirs. However, accurate forecasts of productivity can be difficult because of the need to understand and account for the complex processes that occur in the near-well region.When the well pressure falls below the dewpoint, a region of high liquid saturation builds up around the well, impairing the flow of gas and reducing productivity. It is essential to take account o.this condensate-blockage effect when calculating well productivity.Most of the drawdown to a condensate well occurs close to the wellbore, where gas velocities may be very high and the relationship between flow rate and pressure drop may be complicated by two additional phenomena - the increase in mobility at high capillary number1-4 (sometimes referred to as positive coupling or viscous stripping) and the non-Darcy (or inertial) flow.In many gas-condensate wells, the net effect of the two high-velocity phenomena is to improve productivity, reducing the impairment caused by condensate blockage. The importance of high-velocity effects has been demonstrated by history matching results for a number of wells in which it was possible to obtain a satisfactory match only when high-velocity effects were included in the simulation model.5,6 It is important to include these high-velocity effects when simulating gas-condensate-well performance.Well-Productivity CalculationsThe most accurate way to calculate gas-condensate-well productivity is by fine-grid numerical simulation, either in single-well models with a fine grid near the well or in full-field models using local grid refinement. A fine-grid model will allow high-velocity effects to be modeled, and most commercial simulators now include options to account for non-Darcy flow and the increase in mobility at high capillary number.While numerical simulation is suitable for detailed forecasting of reservoir behavior, there are many applications for which this level of modeling is not justified and simpler engineering calculations are more appropriate.Simpler calculations are particularly useful to provide rapid forecasts of well deliverability, for sensitivity studies to assess the impact of parameters such as relative permeability or pressure/volume/temperature (PVT) properties, or to estimate the benefits of fractured or horizontal wells. They may also be more appropriate when accurate data on reservoir-fluid or -rock properties are not available.Another application of a simple model is as part of an integrated study involving issues such as pipelines, surface facilities, drilling schedules, and gas sales contracts. This type of integrated model also can be used with decision risk management techniques to optimize development strategies, while taking account of uncertainties in reservoir data or financial parameters.7This paper provides a method of forecasting gas-condensate-well performance by use of a material-balance model for reservoir depletion and a two-phase pseudopressure integral for well inflow performance. Fluid PVT properties are calculated from a modified black-oil model, in which properties such as oil/gas ratio (OGR) and formation volume factor are tabulated against pressure. Simulation studies have shown no significant difference between compositional-simulator results and those from a modified black-oil model for gas-condensate reservoirs under depletion,8,9 so a black-oil model is quite adequate for the engineering calculations in this work. Appendix A describes the material-balance model.The well inflow-performance relationship (IPR) is based on the pseudopressure-integral method, which can take account of condensate blockage, including the impact of high-velocity effects. The well inflow calculation is discussed in detail in the following section.The well IPR is used to calculate the maximum gas-production rate from the well at a particular value of average reservoir pressure. This rate is then adjusted to allow for any well or facilities limits, resulting in a table of gas rate vs. average reservoir pressure. The pressure intervals in this table are the same as those in the input table of PVT properties (typically at intervals of 200 to 500 psi). From this table, production profiles can be calculated giving oil- and gas-production rates as a function of time.

AB  - Abstract Gas-condensate reservoirs exhibit complex phase and flow behaviors due to the appearance of condensate banking in the near-well region. A good understanding of how the condensate accumulation influences the productivity and the composition configuration in the liquid phase is very important to optimize the producing strategy, to reduce the impact of condensate banking, and to improve the ultimate gas recovery. This study addressed several issues related to the behavior of the composition variation, condensate saturation build-up and condensate recovery during the gas-condensate producing process. A key factor that controls the gas-condensate well deliverability is the relative permeability, which is influenced directly by the condensate accumulation. The accumulated condensate bank not only reduces both the gas and liquid relative permeability, but also changes the phase composition of the reservoir fluid, hence reshapes the phase diagram of reservoir fluid and varies the fluid properties. Different producing strategies may impact the composition configuration for both flowing and static phases and the amount of the liquid trapped in the reservoir, which in turn may influence the well productivity and hence the ultimate gas and liquid recovery from the reservoir. Changing the manner in which the well is brought into flowing condition can affect the liquid dropout composition and can therefore change the degree of productivity loss. In this study, compositional simulations of multicomponent gas-condensate fluids were conducted at field scale to investigate the composition and condensate saturation variations. Different producing strategies have been compared, and the optimum producing sequences are suggested for maximum gas recovery. A core flooding experiment with two-component synthetic gas-condensate was designed and constructed to model gas-condensate production behavior from pressure above the dew-point to below. Experimental observations of gas-condensate production confirm the dramatic changes in the liquid composition seen in the simulations. Introduction Liquid forms in a gas-condensate reservoir when the bottom-hole pressure drops below the dew-point pressure. The accumulated condensate in the vicinity of the well bore causes a blockage effect and reduces the effective permeability appreciably, and also causes the loss of heavy components at surface. These effects depend on a number of reservoir and well parameters. The productivity loss caused by the condensate buildup is striking. In some cases, the decline can be as high as a factor of two to four, according to the case studies of Afidick et al.1 and Barnum et al.2. Even in very lean gas-condensate reservoirs with a maximum liquid drop out of only 1%, the productivity may be reduced by a factor of about two as the pressure drops below the dew-point pressure1. In order to predict well deliverability and calculate gas and liquid recovery, it is necessary to have a detailed knowledge of liquid banking in gas-condensate fields. Fevang and Whitson3 addressed the well deliverability problem in their gas-condensate modeling, where they observed that well deliverability impairment resulting from near well-bore condensate "blockage?? depends on PVT, absolute and relative permeabilities, and how the well is being produced. The relative permeability effect has been reported in field observations. Variations of reservoir fluid PVT properties at discovered condition have been observed and discussed for many reservoirs around the world (for example reference 4 for mid-eastern reservoirs and reference 5 for North Sea reservoirs). Lee6 also presented an example to show the variation of composition and saturation of the gas-condensate system due to the influences of capillary and gravitational forces.  Roussennac7 illustrated the phase change during the depletion in his numerical simulation. According to Roussennac, during the drawdown period, with the liquid building up in the well grid cell, the overall mixture in that cell becomes richer in heavy components, and the fluid behavior changes from the initial gas-condensate reservoir to that of a volatile/black oil reservoir.

AB  - IntroductionFormation damage is a hot topic these days-with justifiable reason, as more operating companies move to the exploitation of more and more challenging oil and gas reservoirs in tighter, deeper, and more depleted conditions. Disappointing production or injection results from an oil or gas well can be related to a number of factors which may be difficult to diagnose. Some of these may center about poor inherent natural reservoir quality characteristics, others about mechanical considerations surrounding the condition and type of the wellbore obtained, and still others under the nebulous catch-all of "formation damage" which often (and sometimes unjustly) absorbs the majority of the blame for the poor results of many projects. Formation damage in oil and gas wells is difficult to quantify in many cases. This is due to the inability of the reservoir engineer to retrieve exact samples and conduct detailed measurements on the area of interest, usually represented by a volume of rock surrounding the wellbore which is generally several thousand meters below the surface of the earth. However, ongoing research over the years has allowed the development of a variety of techniques allowing the use of the available information to obtain a much better indication f the type and degree of damage which different reservoirs may be sensitive to, thereby adjusting operating practices to attempt to minimize or reduce these permeability reducing factors. This data would include information such as production and pressure data, pressure transient data, log analysis, fluid and PVT data and core, cuttings, and special core analysis data. The subject of this brief article is to provide a synopsis of some of the types of formation damage which commonly present themselves as problems for many oil and gas producing projects, and review some of the associated technology being used to overcome these problems. How Much of a Concern is Formation Damage?A technical definition of formation damage would be "any process that causes a reduction in the natural inherent productivity of an oil or gas producing formation, or a reduction in the injectivity of a water or gas injection well." Although the drilling process often bears the brunt of the blame, formation damage can occur at any time during the life of a well including completion, production, stimulation, kill, or workover operations. Often the problem is ignored due to a combination of ignorance and apathy with the common rationale that "We don't care about formation damage in this reservoir-we can always fracture through it." Surprisingly, this pretense may make sense in certain situations, particularly when the formation is of such low inherent quality that it is obvious the flow area and driving differential pressure available for production present in a normal cased and perforated or open hole completion are insufficient to sustain economic production rates, even with a totally "non damaged" well.

AB  - AbstractA measurable improvement in productivity can be achieved using xanthan gelled acid to stimulate carbonate formations. Well productivity results were compared to conventional acid fracture treatments. The significant improvements over classical acid fracturing techniques are due to the improved control of acid leakoff rates, retarded reaction rate and improved fracture width maintenance. The difficulties involved in acid fracturing massive Middle East carbonate formations are discussed and solutions are proposed using gelled acid technology. Some limitations in computer predictions of acid fracturing results are also discussed. predictions of acid fracturing results are also discussedIntroductionIn order to stimulate the production of oil or gas wells, it is necessary to penetrate the drainage area with a fracture that will allow a relatively unrestricted flow of fluids to the wellbore. McGuire and Sikora described the interrelationship between fracture conductivity and penetration in obtaining productivity increases. For the maximum response productivity increases. For the maximum response from stimulation, it is necessary to optimize both the effective fracture penetration and the flow capacity or conductivity. In fracture acidizing, the primary limiting factors for obtaining a maximum penetration of live acid are the inefficiency of acid as a fracturing fluid and its intrinsic rapid rate of reaction. A viable approach to effectively controlling these factors is to develop viscosity in the acid. Numerous polymers, such as guar gum, gum Karaya and polysaccharides, have polymers, such as guar gum, gum Karaya and polysaccharides, have been used to thicken acids in the past. The benefits derived from these gelled acids were limited by the instability of the polymers in acid at treating temperatures. The introduction polymers in acid at treating temperatures. The introduction of xanthan polymer as a thickening agent for acid was a recent innovation. This polymer, combined with other essential proprietary ingredients, can produce a thickened acid with relatively long-term temperature stability. Acid gelled with this formulation will hereafter be referred to as xanthan gelled acid. During the past three years, the xanthan gelled acid has been used to stimulate numerous carbonate formations with success. The unique characteristics of the xanthan gelled acid have provided improved results from treatments of low-permeability provided improved results from treatments of low-permeability carbonates. These characteristics should also prove useful in treating more permeable carbonates, such as those common to the Middle East. CHARACTERISTICS Acid thickened with the xanthan polymer formulation at a concentration of 60 lb/1,000 gal (7,190 g/m3) of 15% HCl, has a viscosity of 41.8 cp (0.0418 Pa sec) at 170 sec-1 and 50C. In contrast, ungelled 15% HCl has a viscosity of 1.5 cp (0.0015 Pa sec) at the same temperature. The viscosity of the xanthan Pa sec) at the same temperature. The viscosity of the xanthan gelled acid is compared to ungelled acids at various temperatures in Figure 1. By increasing the viscosity of the acid, fluid efficiency is improved and reaction rate is reduced. In order to obtain the maximum benefit from a gelled acid, the viscosity must be stable under downhole conditions for the duration of the treatment. The xanthan gelled acid is relatively stable at temperatures up to 105C. At temperatures below 40C, there is virtually no degradation of viscosity with time (Figure 2). At a treating temperature of 70C, Figure 2 shows that there is some reduction in viscosity over a one-hour period. However, the viscosity stability is also affected by the degree of acid spending. Under acid fracturing conditions, the time that the polymer will be required to survive degradation in 15% HCl is polymer will be required to survive degradation in 15% HCl is limited. p. 499

AB  - AbstractThe effect of completion ID in four different sand control completions was studied using inflow modeling and reservoir simulation. An expandable sand screen and three different IDs of external gravel packs were studied, in various lengths of horizontal well and over a range of flow rates. The ID of a completion affects the performance of a completion through the flow friction pressure generated. The friction pressure is a function of the ID to the inverse 5th power so even small changes in ID can have an effect. Each completion configuration was assumed to have the same realistic production rate. The friction pressure tends to act as a choke on production from the toe of the well; this concentrates production towards the heel. The expandable sand screen has the lowest inflow at the heel and the smallest ID gravel pack has the highest inflow. The high inflow at the heel draws water up from the underlying aquifer and initiates water breakthrough. The time to breakthrough was calculated using a simple analytical theory. The predicted time agreed well with available production data. A reservoir model was built to further study the heterogeneous inflow. This showed that the larger ID completions gave the best sweep of the reservoir with the highest recovery. The reservoir model was run for a variety of well lengths and productions rates and showed that for long high rate wells the completion with the largest ID gave the best sweep and the longest water breakthrough time. IntroductionLong horizontal wells are an increasingly common option for the drainage of certain reservoirs. They have numerous advantages over vertical wells. Larger contact with the formations gives low flow rates and drawdowns. This is especially valuable in wells drilled close to the oil water or gas il contact, such as in oil rim or attic developments. It is crucial in the planning of such developments that the effects of wellbore friction are taken into account. In a horizontal well of infinite hydraulic conductivity the friction is zero and the drawdown and inflow are constant along the entire well length. For a finite hydraulic conductivity the friction pressure causes variations in drawdown and inflow along the well. The effect of friction in a horizontal well is to concentrate production towards the heel of the well. This is due to flow from the toe experiencing an additional backpressure due to the friction, which inhibits inflow. The high flow at the heel, which can be double the infinite conductivity case, accelerates water or gas coning into the well. There are ways to deal with this effect, both before and after the fact. For long drains, inflow control devices can be placed in the screens to choke back the flow at the heel. This in effect chokes back production and it is still difficult to achieve the correct inflow without downhole flow and pressure measurements. After water breakthrough, options involve downhole flow control and water shut off treatments.

AB  - Abstract Excessive loss of high-density brines into the formation has always been a major concern during completion operations, since it is uneconomical and leads to formation damage and well control issues. A viscoelastic surfactant (VES) system was introduced as an alternative for polymers because of high-temperature instability, incompatibility problems, and the necessity of acid cleanup for the polymer-based system. However, past literature documented that VES systems were limited to only CaCl2/CaBr2 brines due to the negative effect of ZnBr2 solutions on the surfactant's ability to form gel which limits the applicable density for past fluid-loss pills. This paper introduces improved fluid technology that uses nanoparticles and new low molecular weight surfactants to effectively control fluid-losses for high-density brine that contains ZnBr2 at high temperature application. Laboratory studies were conducted to examine the effect of the VES system on controlling leak-off rate using a HP/HT fluid-loss cell. The apparent viscosity of the VES solution was measured as a function of shear rate and temperature (up to 300°F). Based on experimental results leak-off of surfactant based fluid is controlled by the elastic structure of the surfactant micelles. The strong elastic structure of gel will not deform to pass through the pores, it will plug this pores and eliminate any flow of the solution. Therefore, surfactant-based pill developed long-term stability as it tested for 7 days with a noticeable decrease in the leak-off rate with time. Optimum surfactant concentration does not depend on the brine composition or formation permeability but it was mainly dependent on temperature. A breaker based on mineral oil caused a smooth viscosity decline while a breaker based on mutual solvent had a rapid viscosity decline. For mutual solvent, viscosity was instantaneously reduced by 50 to 90% depending on brine composition, surfactant concentration and temperature. However, temperature has most significant effect. Introduction Excessive loss of high-density brines into the formation has always been a major concern during completion operations because it is uneconomical and leads to formation damage, hole collapse and well control issues. Typically, the fluid-loss control pills are composed of very high concentrations of crosslinked polymers. The sealing mechanism of these pills is a combination of viscosity, solids bridging, and polymer filter-cake buildup on the porous rock. Due to the instability of polymers at high bottomhole temperatures, incompatibility with some divalent brine, and the necessity to cleanup with acid, a new solids-free lost-circulation pill that is stable in a high-salt environment should be developed. Polymer systems are very effective in fluid-loss control as long as the temperature limit of the specific polymer is not exceeded. Studies with particulate systems in polymers showed irreversible plugging, which negatively influences the productivity or injectivity of the given zone. It has been reported that xanthan gum pills on Berea sandstone cores yielded less than 10% regained permeability (Himes et al. 1991). Hydroxyethylcellulose (HEC) is well known for its low residual content, but even at 14 to 18 kg/m3, it will not form a compact filter cake if the formation permeability is higher than 20 mD (Parlar et al. 1996; Vitthal and McGowen 1996). Normally, HEC polymer solutions are difficult to crosslink and do not form rigid gels. They control fluid loss through viscous drag force and gradual filtration. Hence, these fluids penetrate deeper into the formation than the crosslinked fluids and can cause severe permeability damage. The retained permeability for non-crosslinked HEC is typically in the 30% to 50% range (Hodge et al. 1995; Parlar et al. 1996).

AB  - AbstractSince 1989, Husky Oil has drilled 12 horizontal wells in six mature hydrocarbon vertical miscible flood pools. To date, these horizontal wells have been very successful in reducing gas coning and improving oil productivity(1) as originally intended. Furthermore, actual field performance indicates that, in some cases, horizontal wells have considerably improved productivities of adjacent vertical wells.The drilling of a horizontal well in the Rainbow Keg River E Pool resulted in a 10 - 15% increase in oil production and a cessation in the rising gas-oil ratio in the offset vertical wells. Such unexpected benefits are attributed to improved drainage to the vertical wells induced by the drilling of the horizontal well, along with the healing and/or reduction of the gas cone at the vertical wellbores. These hypothesized causes for the unexpected benefits were qualitatively confirmed with a 3-D numerical simulation model.It is concluded that drilling of horizontal wells can improve the productivities of offset vertical wells. The fear of drawing gas over to a horizontal well that is drilled close to gas coning vertical well(s) may be unfounded under most situations. After drilling a horizontal well into a target area, the lateral section can be extended to cover areas near offset vertical well(s) to improve drainage and reduce some of the gas coning tendencies around the offset vertical wellbore(s).IntroductionSince 1989, Husky Oil has drilled 12 horizontal wells in six mature hydrocarbon vertical miscible flood pools (Figure 1). The original intent of the horizontal drilling technology in these reservoirs is two-fold: to minimize coning and channeling of gas and water, to attain larger drainage area, resulting in incremental oil sandwich recovery and improved oil productivity(1-3).To date, all of these horizontal wells have been extremely successful in reducing gas coning and in improving oil productivity(1). On average, initial capital investment is paid out within one year. The length of the lateral sections has increased from 178 m in the first well to as long as 720 m with each subsequent well drilled into a progressively riskier target(1). More importantly, actual field performance now indicates that, in some cases, horizontal wells can also considerably improve the productivities of adjacent vertical wells.This paper presents one case history (Rainbow Keg River E Pool) showing the additional benefits of horizontal wells, the results of a conceptual numerical simulation model that was used to rationalize and substantiate the reasons for such unexpected benefits, and finally a discussion on a new application of horizontal well technology in further enhancing oil recovery in mature, vertical miscible floods.Field Performance ObservationsRainbow Keg River E PoolPool DescriptionThe Rainbow Keg River E Pool (Figure 1) is one of the carbonate reefs of Middle Devonian age discovered in the mid-sixties in northwestern Alberta. Using both material balance and volumetric calculations, the original oil-in-place (OOIP) was determined to be 4.2 x 106 m3.

AB  - Abstract Objectives/Scope Worksite health promotion programs result significant improvements in employee health and reductions in employer health care costs. Healthier employees are more likely to stay in their jobs and are less likely to be absent. Employees in self-identified healthier work environments also report improved morale and lower intention to quit. Increasingly, high quality applicants view the wellness culture ofa corporation as a key factor in choosing an employer. This case study describes relationships among business units’ wellness indexscores, health risk profiles, employee engagement, ergonomic and presenteeism data; as well as examines implications for safeoperations. Method, Procedures, Process Upstream, downstream and midstream business unit 2016 data in a multinational oil company has been examined. Business unit wellness index scores reflect participation in wellness best practices as determined from assessment of leadership engagement; workplace policies and environment; wellness programming; and data evaluation approach. Health risk profile and presenteeism data are determined from aggregate health risk appraisal data, which includes measures of lifestyle risk and productivity measures using validated survey tools. Employee engagement is determined at the business unit level based on responses to the global employee survey. Aggregate ergonomic data is determined from repetitive stress injury prevention software. Results, Observations, Conclusions In 2016, 9,575 employees completed a Health Risk Appraisal as part of their participation in the global Healthy Heart program. Unhealthy diet, overweight and poor blood pressures were identified as top risks in many locations. Three-year cohort data have demonstrated positive impacts on lost productivity due to health issues, and net positive risk level migration of at-risk U.S. participants. 2016 global employee survey data demonstrated that wellness was identified by the workforce as a strength, and was associated with employee engagement. Our comprehensive wellness programming has focused on the integration of wellness and safety, particularly related to ergonomic health and fitness for duty. By evaluating health risk data concurrent with wellness index scores, we determine alignment with wellness best practices and provide a tool for business units to assess their health programming and any needed organizational changes around health. Novel/Additive Information Prevention-focused health and wellness programs can impact workforce health in the diverse settings that energy companies operate. This paper provides relevant industry-specific data that support the business value of health and wellness programs, and begins to explore the relationships among health metrics, injury prevention, productivity and safety measures in a multinational oil company.

AB  - AbstractThis paper described the result of simulation study in naturally fractured reservoirs, when using underbalanced drilling (UBD). It has been recognized that short period of overbalanced can occur in UBD operation. The intention of this paper to investigate that nature of that damage in short overbalanced conditions during UBD operation. The model intends to study of OBD and time effect during UBD. A PC-based reservoir simulator, which free version is available 6000 cells is used to simulate overbalanced and underbalanced wellbore conditions. The model is characterized by very low matrix permeability (1 mD) and very high fracture permeability (5000 mD) and matrix pore volume. The model is formed by a number of matrix blocks (cubes) intersected by an orthogonal network of fractures. The matrix blocks permanently feed the fractures network. Both OBD and UBD wellbore condition were studied and productivity has been calculated for a various boundary conditions and reservoir parameters. Drilling operation (both UBD and OBD) is simulated in 10 days and followed by 50 days production at constant drawdown pressure. The effects of invading fluid are studied by employing production model with skin and without skin. The skin option represents the permanent damage around wellbore, where non-skin accounts the saturation changes around wellbore region that can be cured by production. For simulation of UBD case, no mud invasion is taking placed, however damage in UBD has arise as capillary forces observed liquid into the formation. The simulations study is summarized as following cases:UBD with no influx during drilling (without reservoir inflow)OBD with continuous filtration from the wellbore to the formation (with constant over pressure of 5, 50, 500 psi)UBD with 72 minutes of over balance condition after the 7th drilling day (10 days for UBD operation).OBD with change in rock-wettability around wellbore.UBD with capillary effect.Finally, the simulation results as productivity gained are discussed for all cases.IntroductionMinimizing formation damage that occurs during conventional drilling is a critical point for optimizing an oil field development, especially in fractured carbonate reservoirs. Mud invasion into the fractured formation can create severe formation damage around wellbore and reduces the productivity of well and ultimate recovery of the field. Therefore elimination and minimizing of fluid invasion is very important in this type of reservoirs. The productivity benefits of underbalanced drilling are well known in the industry. When UBD is implemented correctly, it considerably reduces or eliminates mud invasion into the fracture systems. Many field experiences have shown that UBD minimizes of mud losses into the pay zone and formations. Even though UBD has many advantages over OBD it is necessary to quantify possible formation damage effects by performing reservoir characterization and feasibility studies in advance.We attempt in this paper to evaluate important factors related to UBD operation and compare results with overbalanced conditions in wells that are drilled in the naturally fractured reservoir.

AB  - Abstract Less than half of fracturing fluid is typically recovered during flow-back operation. This study models the effects of capillarity and geomechanics on water loss in fracture-matrix system and investigates the circumstances under which this phenomenon might be beneficial or detrimental to subsequent on tight oil production. During the shut-in (soaking) and flow-back periods, fracture conductivity decreases as effective stress increases caused by imbibition. Previous works have studied geomechanical influence assuming single-phase flow, but the coupled effect of imbibition due to multiphase flow and stress-dependent fracture properties is less understood. A series of mechanistic simulation models are constructed to simulate multiphase flow and fluid distribution during shut-in and flow-back. Three systems: matrix, hydraulic fracture and micro fractures are explicitly represented in the computational domain. Sensitivities to wettability and multiphase flow functions (relative permeability and capillary pressure relationships) are investigated. As wettability to water increases, matrix imbibition increases. Imbibed water would help to displace hydrocarbons into nearby micro and hydraulic fractures, enhancing initial oil rate. However, fracture compacts as fluid pressure decreases. Increase in short-term oil production as a result of imbibition could be counteracted by the reduction in flow capability due to fracture closure. Therefore, the coupling of stress-dependent fracture conductivity and imbibition are studied next. Our results indicate that the fracture compaction can enhance imbibition and water loss, which in turn leads to further reduction in fracture pressure and conductivity. Spatial variability in micro-fracture properties is also modeled probabilistically to investigate whether it is possible for fracturing fluid to be trapped in the micro fractures, or conversely, the micro fractures could provide alternate pathways for fluids to access the hydraulic fracture systems. This work presents a quantitative study of the controlling factors of water loss due to fluid-rock properties and geomechanics. The results highlight the crucial interplay between imbibition and geomechanics in short- and long-term production performances. The results in this study would have considerable impacts on understanding and improving current industry practice on fracturing design and assessment of stimulated reservoir volume.

AB  - Abstract This paper documents the performance of different sand control completion types in three subsea fields tied back to the Statfjord C platform. Seawater is injected as part of the reservoir drainage strategy on all three fields and this presents challenges related to precipitation of sulphate scales when the seawater mixes with incompatible formation water in the near wellbore area. Well completions are of various types on these fields; conventional perforated casing with normal and orientated perforated phasing, sand screen, cased hole and openhole gravelpack. This basket of different completion solutions reflects the differing sanding tendencies of the various reservoirs and the general developments in completion technology throughout the field life.  Sulphate scale buildup in the screen and near well bore has been found to be a major damage mechanism in all sand control completion types. The wells typically show immediate productivity index (PI) reduction following seawater breakthrough. Some data verify a stabilization of PI when the seawater cut reaches a high level. A comparison of the differing scaling tendencies of the completion types is made and guidelines on developments in skin as a function of production characteristics are presented. Up to 1995 cased hole gravelpack was the dominating sand control technique in Statoil but poor trends in productivity following water breakthrough has lead Statoil to adopt openhole solutions. Theoretical arguments suggest that openhole completions are more tolerant of scale than cased hole gravelpacks. This paper documents whether any significant differences in scaling tolerance have been experienced in these fields. This has had consequences for estimation of productivity development and the expected scale prevention strategy chosen for the Statfjord depressurization project. The paper shows that combined scale dissolver and scale inhibitor treatments have been successful in regaining productivity in these. Bullheading of scale treatments down the methanol service line has been a very cost effective method of treating scale depositions in wells tied back to the platform with distances of up to 7 km. For templates further from the platform, treatments are now performed from a dynamically positioned boat where a flexible hose is connected to the choke bridge. Introduction This case study includes data from three subsea fields on the Norwegian Continental Shelf. Statfjord Nord, Statfjord Øst and Sygna (Statfjord Satellites) are all developed with subsea templates connected to process facilities through a common inlet separator on the Statfjord C platform. There are 5 production templates and 2 injection templates in total. Each template has 4 well slots available connected by a single pipeline to Statfjord C. The pipeline lengths from process facilities to the templates range from 6 to 21 km. Each pipeline can be routed to inlet separator or a test separator.  Production from Statfjord Øst came on stream in 1994, Statfjord Nord in 1995 and Sygna in 2000. Total cumulative production from the three fields up to September 2005 is 70 million Sm3 of oil. Expected Statfjord Satellites field life time is 2019, with an expected recovery factor of approximately 55%. Production is primarily from sands in the Brent formation, but also includes the Munin formation on Statfjord Nord. The reservoirs contain oil at pressures above bubble point pressure, and with fairly low gas oil ratio. Permeabilities range from 10 to 10000 mD. The reservoir drainage strategy includes reservoir pressure maintenance by injecting deareated seawater. Formation water characteristics are important data for understanding scale potential. All three fields have nearly identical formation water ion content, hence comparable theoretical scale potential. Typical formation water ion content is shown in the table below.

AB  - This paper was prepared for the 48th Annual Fall Meeting of the Society of Petroleum Engineers of AIME, to be held in Las Vegas, Nev., Sept. 30-Oct. 3, 1973. Permission to copy is restricted to an abstract of not more than 300 words. Illustrations may not be copied. The abstract should contain conspicuous acknowledgment of where and by whom the paper is presented. Publication elsewhere after publication in the JOURNAL OF PETROLEUM TECHNOLOGY or the SOCIETY OF PETROLEUM ENGINEERS JOURNAL is usually granted upon request to the Editor of the appropriate journal provided agreement to give proper credit is made. Discussion of this paper is invited. Three copies of any discussion should be sent to the Society of Petroleum Engineers office. Such discussion may be presented at the above meeting and, with the paper, may be considered for publication in one of the two SPE magazines. AbstractThe theory concerning the effect of incomplete fracture fill-up at the wellbore on productivity ratio is summarized in this paper. It is pointed out that a positive effort to achieve good propping agent packing at the wellbore can result in a productivity ratio of up to twice that which would productivity ratio of up to twice that which would have been attained if the fracture were allowed to close. Also discussed are present fracture treatment methods and proposed modifications to accomplish better fill-up near the wellbore. Data are presented which indicate to obtain good fracture-to-well communication, fracturing treatments should be designed and performed using a controlled screen-out method, and a means of implementing controlled screen-out treatments is outlined. Results presented emphasize the importance of complete fracture fill-up near the wellbore. Money spent in increasing fracture conductivity will be wasted unless good fracture-to-well communication is achieved. Techniques to insure that the fracture is filled at the wellbore should be applied in all fracturing treatments except where prohibited by unusual conditions (weak pipe, fracturing under a packer, etc.). IntroductionThe process of hydraulic fracturing has been used extensively for well stimulation by the petroleum industry for over two decades. During petroleum industry for over two decades. During this time the ability to successfully execute a fracturing treatment has increased to the point where very few mechanical failures point where very few mechanical failures currently occur. In addition, the development of treatment design and evaluation procedures has evolved to the point where fracturing is now considered a science rather than an art. As the science progresses, new problems concerning the design and evaluation of optimum fracturing treatments arise frequently. One of the most pertinent of these problems is what effect pertinent of these problems is what effect incomplete fracture fill-up at the wellbore has on productivity ratio. Solution of this problem will be useful in treatment planning to accomplish desired production goals. The purpose of this paper is to evaluate the effect of incomplete fracture fill-up at the wellbore on productivity ratio, and to present the findings of a controlled screen-out fracturing program which was initiated for the purpose of obtaining field results to purpose of obtaining field results to substantiate the theory presented in the paper.

AB  - Abstract More than 70% of global oil production derives from mature fields. With current elevated prices, the revitalization and optimization of these fields are of great commercial appeal and interest. However, revitalization requires technologies and procedures for quick analysis and diagnosis of the field in addition to established technical solutions to help improve productivity and counter high levels of pressure and production decline. In 2013, in the southern region of Mexico, workflow integration for integral analysis of well productivity in mature fields and naturally fractured carbonate reservoirs, in combination with joint efforts of several product service lines and their technological solutions, have been key to identifying a portfolio of opportunities for well interventions. Of which, in a short time period, an increase to production of 1, 843 STB/D of oil was achieved, with only 54.5% of the proposed activity involving well services. In view of the energy requirements in the world and the low rate of discovery of new reserves, many companies have targeted maximizing the exploitation of mature fields. Therefore, this study intends to establish effective techniques, methodologies, best practices, and lessons learned developed by multidisciplinary teams performed in Mexico during the past eight years. This strategy has helped increase oil and gas production in areas where it was previously considered unlikely because of complexity issues, such as low pressures, low permeability, organic deposits, scales, advanced fluid, reservoir dynamics, and mechanical problems, among others. These efforts have resulted in highly successful solutions as well as added value to the national operator.

AB  - Summary Newly developed, generalized analytic solutions to the heat equation forarbitrary 3D well trajectory in anisotropic media are demonstrated to solvebenchmark horizontal- and slanted-well productivity problems with unprecedentedspeed and accuracy. Arbitrary well trajectory is constructed as an assemblageof spatially integrated, linear well segments, as opposed to a distribution ofnumerically integrated point sources, to provide advantages in bothcomputational speed and accuracy in singularity handling. Production from eacharbitrarily oriented segment is reduced to a combination of purely analyticexpressions and rapidly convergent, exponentially damped infinite sumapproximations. With offered flexibility in cell boundary conditions, theexpressions can yield standalone well-productivity estimates for complex wellsor serve as the basis for advanced well equations, if integrated within anumerical reservoir simulator. Transients are also computed with analyticalintegrations in time, thus requiring no time marching. The breakthrough speedand accuracy in productivity assessment open possibilities for advancedwell-testing and reservoir-characterization methods. We further demonstrate the usefulness of analytic methodology with severaltime-dependent, discrete fracture problems for shale gas production withtypical Barnett conditions, allowing direct use of complex fracture patterns,such as those interpreted from microseismic mapping. In addition touniform-flux and uniform-pressure modeling options, a new analytic model isintroduced that is capable of modeling both time-dependent material transportbetween matrix and a stimulated zone and the interplay between a well andfracture. We illustrate our solution method with Barnett fractured-wellexamples from the literature. With optional effects such as gas desorption andstress-dependent fracture conductivity as easy add-ons, we can producefull-operational-life production forecasts for shale or tight gas reservoirsfrom discrete, complex fracture patterns along with reservoir-pressure mappingsin a matter of minutes on common PC platforms.

AB  - AbstractA proactive approach to economically improving well productivity was undertaken at the beginning of the development drilling program in the Point McIntyre field on the North Slope of Alaska. This paper describes the comprehensive approach, laboratory tests, field implementation, and well test verification of reduced skin damage. The approach was a combination of a minimally damaging KCl mud with limited leakoff, KCl in the cement and spacer, rapid drilling rates, and deep perforations. Laboratory tests of the rock and mud were performed before the onset of the drilling program, to identify potential damage mechanisms and to select the least expensive, least damaging, drilling mud. Field procedures were developed which ultimately led to open-hole displacement of freshwater mud to KCl mud just above the pay, which reduced the incremental cost by a factor of 2. The success of the drilling and completion strategy was demonstrated using pressure buildup tests to measure skin. Inexpensive pressure buildup tests were conducted prior to field startup, using in- house personnel and equipment, in addition to more conventional testing after field startup. Development well skins were compared with those of previous exploration wells and with water injectors which were drilled with a common low-solids non-dispersed freshwater mud. Although this reservoir would not normally be identified as particularly damage-prone, use of the KCl mud helped improve well productivity by almost 60% over wells drilled with the freshwater mud commonly used in the region. The well test and productivity data clearly justified the additional cost of using the more expensive drilling mud. Costly well stimulations were avoided, and infill drilling was deferred.IntroductionThe Point McIntyre field lies offshore the North Slope of Alaska, in the vicinity of Prudhoe Bay. It is produced from two drill sites, one of which was created by widening the Prudhoe Bay West Dock causeway. Ten exploration and delineation wells were drilled, followed by an additional 10 equity wells to determine the ownership interests of Arco, BP, and Exxon. Sixty additional development wells were planned to develop the field on 80-acre spacing.The exploration wells were drilled and cored using various water-based muds, most commonly typical Prudhoe Bay low solids non-dispersed water-based mud and coring fluids. They were cemented using traditional Prudhoe Bay preflushes, spacers and slurries. All had single tubing strings, and most were single packer, carbon steel (L-80) completions. Tubing sizes ranged from 2-7/8" to 5-1/2", most with a reduced tailpipe size below the packer to accommodate a smaller profile.Eight of the ten exploration wells were drill-stem or production tested. Pressure transient analysis of the build-up data yielded the skins listed in Table 1. In three of these wells, the perforated length was less than the pay length, and so the measured skins had to be corrected for partial penetration. The skins attributed to formation damage and perforation efficiency ranged from 3 to 36. The median skin was about 8.Clearly there was great potential for enhancing completion efficiency. Initial efforts to understand the wide range in skins focused on the drilling mud systems. Key mud properties were documented for each well including mud type, fluid loss, mud weight, mud salinity, and time in formation. An attempt to correlate these parameters, both individually and in groups did not yield any general insights, but it appeared likely that the drilling mud was responsible for some level of damage in each well. The investigation was expanded to look also at cementing and perforating practices on each well. Once again, no clear, universal correlation was discernible. In several cases, though, high skins could be at least partially attributed to less than optimum completion designs and practices.P. 111

Such discussions may be presented at the above meeting and, with the paper, may be considered for publication in one of the two SPE magazines. Abstract Production increases resulting from fracture treatments should be based on the conductivity and location of the propping agent - not on the area created by the frac fluid. Model studies show that in conventional fracture treatments propping agents settle to the bottom of a fracture forming a packed pile of prop. The location and dimensions of the pack are dependent on the physical properties of the prop, fluid and physical properties of the prop, fluid and formation, the geometry, volume and length of the fracture, and the pump rate. This paper presents a mathematical procedure for predicting the location and procedure for predicting the location and dimensions of the prop pack in a vertical linear fracture. A computer program has been prepared and is currently being used in designing fracture treatments. Introduction Studies we have made in models of vertical and horizontal fractures show that in conventional frac treatments props end up in a multilayer packs. We observed this in models where no leak-off occurred as well as in a vertical model with leak-off through one face. Other authors have demonstrated the same phenomena. To the best of our knowledge no one has published model studies which demonstrate that monolayer or partial monolayers are obtained in conventional frac treatments, i.e., where low viscosity gelled oil or water is used as the fracturing fluid. With few exceptions field treatments designed on the basis of monolayer or partial monolayer concepts have not responded any better than conventionally designed treatments. Lab studies, on the other hand, show fracture conductivities of partial monolayers are much greater than conductivities of a pack. We believe this inconsistency is evidence a pack occurred. Our model studies supplied a considerable amount of equilibrium velocity data. Earlier work had described the areal extent of a prop pack where no leak-off occurred. Our goal was pack where no leak-off occurred. Our goal was to describe both the areal extent and location of the prop pack under conditions where leak-off occurred.

AB  - SummaryIn this article we discuss drilling mud losses in naturally fractured reservoirs with fracture permeability larger than 50 odd md and much larger than the matrix permeability.Type curves are provided that describe mud loss volume vs. time and allow the determination of the hydraulic width of natural fractures through the usual type curve matching technique of log/log plots.Real time logging while drilling of natural fracture width permits the proper selection of loss-circulation material (LCM) with respect to particle size distribution. Efficient (rapid) mud loss control is made possible, increasing the chances of minimizing fracture damage by the drilling mud, the cuttings and the LCMs themselves.The total mud losses experienced when drilling a long horizontal section are shown to agree with reservoir properties (derived by well testing) in particularly well-documented examples of the central North Sea.The equations provided can therefore be utilized as well by reservoir engineers to properly evaluate the contribution of natural fractures to the permeability and skin of any well, whether these fractures are clear or are invaded by drilling mud.IntroductionThe idea of monitoring massive mud losses in a naturally fractured reservoir to characterize formation rock characteristics was proposed about 30 years ago1 and is therefore nothing like a new one. Despite a sizeable list of studies since that date, most of the methods derived so far are only qualitative, as evidenced by the most recent publications.2 An attempt of quantitative analysis has lately been proposed for a Newtonian drilling mud based on the assumption of a square root of time behavior of the mud loss rate.3 In our opinion, the parallel made in that study with fluid leakoff in hydraulic fracturing is not valid. Moreover, the assumption of a Newtonian mud is extremely restrictive. Finally, such an approach promotes lots of confusion between normal invasion of natural fractures (at an equivalent circulating density lower than the formation rock fracturing, or parting, pressure), which is the sole scope of the present article, and forced invasion with concomitant propagation of an artificial hydraulic fracture through a porous medium with no secondary porosity. It should be made extremely clear at this point that the following study is focused on mud invasion of natural fractures well below fracturing pressure.The increasing occurrence of oil field developments in fractured reservoirs in the North Sea4 has lately led to even more dedicated efforts at understanding the impact of large mud losses on formation damage and damage removal techniques.5However, the need to come up with a detailed quantitative analysis of the phenomenon has become urgent with the perspective of the startup of the Clair field west of the Shetlands. This huge oil accumulation is the first and so far a unique example of naturally heavily fractured sandstone reservoir in this part of the world. Its successful development cannot be guaranteed unless fracture damage by insoluble cuttings is minimized, if not prevented. Indeed, the large viscosity of the reservoir oil at downhole conditions would not allow for economical production if skin were present. Methods to ensure immediate control of mud losses must be designed and implemented. They cannot be based on anything other than a precise, real time knowledge of the width of the fracture the drilling bit is running through.In addition, the determination of the actual hydraulic width of natural fractures when drilling wildcat and appraisal wells would make extended well tests (EWTs) much less necessary. Formation microimaging (FMI) (and other related acronyms) indeed has only access to visual width and is merely reliable when extremely near-wellbore values of fracture width and spacing are required. It is the industry consensus that the data derived from such logging tools must not be extrapolated at the scale of the reservoir. Hence the requirement for a technique of logging while drilling (LWD) of the hydraulic width of natural fractures to have a meaningful investigation radius.

AB  - Abstract The technology to multi-stage fracture horizontal wells has opened up development of tight hydrocarbon resources world wide. One such resource in Canada is the Cardium Formation which extends over 3.5 million acres and has an estimated OOIP of over 10 billion barrels. The new technology has allowed accessing these tight resources which were previously uneconomic to develop with vertical wells. For the Cardium it is particularly true for the halo (or periphery) where reservoir quality was insufficient for economic depletion with vertical wells. This paper demonstrates an efficient model and methodology to optimize multi-stage fractured horizontal wells and provides production forecasts. A quarter of a fracture numerical simulation method (Quarter-Frac Model) with multi-phase and multi-dimensional characteristics is utilized in this paper to simulate the fluid flow from the repetitive drainage element in a full field development. The model uses an accurate description of the reservoir in terms of geology, fluid characteristics, and pressure profile. The overall performance of the multi-stage fractured horizontal well is determined by a range of completion variables that include well spacing, fracture spacing, fracture dimensions and characteristics, and placement of first and last fracture. The simulations are carried out for a range of completion and development variables. The results are then translated into the performance of the whole horizontal well. The optimum completion and development scenario depends on economic considerations. It is realized that the first and last fractures (toe and heel) will have different drainage areas compared to those of the inside fractures. This is demonstrated by comparing the Quarter-Frac Model to an All-Frac Model simulating an actual horizontal well length with multiple fractures simulated with local grid refinement. A penetration ratio is introduced that describes the effect of placing fractures nearer to the section boundaries. The quarter-fracture model is shown to be efficient and provides reservoir engineers with a practical and accurate tool to design and optimize multi-stage fractured horizontal wells. The quarter-fracture model has applications for primary and secondary recovery. Simulation results for the Cardium Formation have shown rapid pressure decline with primary depletion in full field development. An improvement in recovery can be achieved with pressure maintenance. Some preliminary simulation results are provided that show the effect of water injection which will be piloted in the field to demonstrate the feasibility. Introduction Fracture stimulation has been used for many decades to optimize production of hydrocarbons from a variety of reservoirs. It has been used to control sand production in unconsolidated sand reservoirs using relatively short but wide fractures allowing continuous production of wells but restricting sand influx which reduced wear of bottom hole pumps. In laminated reservoirs, it has allowed connectivity from all layers into the wellbore. Progressively tighter reservoirs have been successfully completed and produced by generating relatively long and narrow fractures. Over the last few years, horizontal well drilling with multi-stage fracturing has opened up even more tight resources that previously were considered uneconomic even with fracture stimulation of vertical wells. In particular, shale gas completion techniques have demonstrated economic feasibility of such resources. It has also revived very low permeability oil reservoirs world wide.

AB  - AbstractUnderbalanced drilling (UBD) is becoming increasingly used as a technique to reduce significant invasive formation damage in vertical and horizontal wells to improve production rates of oil and gas, and enhance injectivity in gas and water injection situations. UBD may be a technically demanding procedure to execute in certain reservoirs and much of the benefit with respect to mitigation of formation damage may be compromised if the underbalanced drilling operation is not screened, designed and conducted in an appropriate fashion. This paper reviews common formation damage mechanisms which may occur in reservoirs and how, in certain situations, these types of damage may be reduced or eliminated through the appropriate use of underbalanced drilling technology. Various situations in which underbalanced drilling technology may result in potential significant formation damage are also discussed.IntroductionUnderbalanced drilling is utilized worldwide for the drilling of horizontally and vertically oriented wells to increase rates of penetration, reduce invasive formation damage and reduce problems with drilling due to lost circulation and differential sticking. Many successful descriptions of underbalanced drilling are present in the literature(1-8). However, underbalanced drilling is not a panacea for all formation damage problems in that inappropriately designed underbalanced drilling jobs may actually result in more formation damage than if a well-designed and contemplated overbalanced job had been used in the same circumstances.This paper reviews some of the technology in use at the present time in underbalanced drilling, and illustrates some of the points which operators should be aware of before embarking on an underbalanced drilling operation.What Is Underbalanced Drilling (UBD)?A rigorous definition of UBD is a condition where the circulating pressure of the drilling fluid in contact with the formation is less than the effective pore pressure in the adjacent matrix. The desirable course of action is to have this occur along the entire exposed section of the productive pay of the reservoir, resulting in an inflow of oil, water or gas (which may be contained in the matrix) into the wellbore. The produced fluids are returned to the surface along with the circulating drilling fluid. A number of descriptions of UBD exist in the literature. They can be described as follows:Overbalanced DrillingA situation in which the equivalent circulating density of the drilling mud is sufficient that, at bottomhole conditions, the drilling fluid pressure is greater than the formation pressure, resulting in an effectively “killed ” state (where no inflow of formation of fluids occurs). This has been the most common technique utilized to drill wells in the past and is still the dominant technology currently used to drill many wells.Low Head DrillingLow head drilling refers to a situation where an overbalance pressure condition, similar to that described above, is maintained but with the use of lower density oil-based fluids or possibly gasified fluids to reduce the magnitude of the overbalance pressure exerted on the formation. The prime motivation is to reduce formation damage and the potential for severe invasive losses and to increase ROP. Low head drilling is still classified as a form of overbalanced drilling.

AB  - Abstract Field experience has demonstrated that gravel sized at 5-6 times the mean formation grain size usually results in adequate sand control. However, the use of larger gravels could provide greater well productivity since the pressure drop through gravel-filled perforations is often significant. Larger gravels are especially attractive in those cases where both fracture stimulation and gravel packing are required. This study was undertaken to determine an optimum proppant/gravel that will provide maximum proppant proppant/gravel that will provide maximum proppant permeability and effective sand control in a friable sandstone permeability and effective sand control in a friable sandstone reservoir. Conventional gravel sizing procedures are based on laboratory studies performed with clean river sands substituted for actual formation materials. In this study, experiments were performed in flow cells using formation core plugs and carcass material, Brine, oil, and gaseous carbon dioxide were injected through the formation material at rates representative of the maximum expected in the near-wellbore region, Gravel permeability and the movement of formation material into and through the gravel pack were then evaluated as a function of gravel size and size distribution, formation mineralogy, degree of formation consolidation, type of flow (single- or multi-phase, steady or pulsed), and experiment duration. pulsed), and experiment duration. The results indicate that effective sand control is obtained in this formation with larger than expected gravels (ratio of mean gravel diameter to mean formation diameter 16:1.) Much higher well productivity can be obtained with the experimentally determined optimum proppant/gravel as compared to that attainable with a gravel/proppant sized using a conventional 5 to 1 gravel to formation ratio. The mechanisms which give rise to effective sand control with such large gravels were determined and are discussed. The method of experimentally determining the optimum gravel size for any formation is described and shown to be simple and fast to perform. The approach can be used with any formation requiring sand control. In many cases the optimum gravel size obtained by this method will be consistent with that predicted by conventional procedures; however, much greater well productivity is possible when the laboratory method indicates that larger gravels can be used. Introduction In gravel packed completions the size of the gravel is most commonly chosen by measuring the mean formation grain size and multiplying by a factor of 5-6. Field experience has demonstrated that this procedure usually results in adequate sand control. However, the use of larger gravels could provide greater well productivity since the pressure drop provide greater well productivity since the pressure drop through gravel-filled perforations is often significant. Larger gravels are especially attractive in those cases where both fracture stimulation and gravel packing are required. Choosing the size of the gravel in these cases is difficult since large, high permeability gravels may be too large to prevent formation sand from being produced, while smaller, prevent formation sand from being produced, while smaller, lower permeability proppants may not provide adequate fracture conductivity for well stimulation. This study was undertaken to determine the optimum gravel/proppant (the terms "gravel" and "proppant" are used interchangeable in this manuscript) for a friable sandstone reservoir in which producing wells needed to be both fracture stimulated and gravel packed. In cases of high formation permeability, the amount of stimulation obtained from a hydraulic fracture is a strong function of the fracture conductivity (fracture width * effective proppant permeability). To maximize production, the highest permeability). To maximize production, the highest permeability proppant consistent with controlling formation permeability proppant consistent with controlling formation sand production should be used. P. 165

AB  - Abstract The ultra-tight nature of shale gas reservoirs has made hydraulic fracturing inevitable. Whilst most of the gas industry is driven by the success of hydraulic fracturing, alternate fracturing techniques have repeatedly been overlooked. In hydraulic fracturing, only 20-30% of the injected water is recovered during clean-up, and this causes a concern over the fracture efficiency. Additionally, the overbalanced pressure during fracturing poses a threat towards damaging the fracture sand face. A potential alternative to eliminate these drawbacks is a forgotten technology-pulsed gas fracturing. The pulsed fracturing (through high pressure gas) also makes the clean-up much faster/simpler. Although the stimulated reservoir volume (SRV) resulting from pulsed fracturing might not be comparable to the one resulting from hydraulic fracturing, it is suspected that the former technique would be more efficient especially in ductile shale where the industry lacks efficient stimulation technique as hydraulic fracturing fails to be successful. Hydraulic fracturing involves a relatively slow loading rate and this usually results in bi-wing fracture geometries. On the other hand, explosive fracturing involves very rapid loading of formation that can trigger multiple fractures. However, due to extreme stress/heat that is generated during the explosion, near wellbore region may reach the plastic limit which inhibits fracture growth away from the wellbore. The pulsed fracturing loading rate and peak load (via high energy gas or propellants) lies in between hydraulic and explosive fracturing processes. This technique has the potential to shatter ductile shale(s): in particular by triggering a ductile to brittle transition: at an optimized pulse rate at a certain depth. Through coupling of geomechanical and reservoir models, a workflow to predict the generated fracture networks and to quantify the productivity/efficiency of the same has been established. Additionally, in order to account for the various phenomena that are expected to occur during transient production, parameters such as desorption and stress dependent permeability have been considered and are presented in this paper. This paper serves as a platform to compare the models depicting the established process of hydraulic fracturing versus an alternate fracturing technique like pulsed gas fracturing.

AB  - Abstract Economic exploitation of low-permeability or tight sandstone and carbonates can be an elusive endeavor. New technologies and approaches are needed to make these more challenging reservoirs economically attractive. The completion technique discussed in this paper has been successfully employed in previously non-economic gas reservoirs in North America. The main focus of this completion technique is enhanced reservoir connectivity with the wellbore. Other completion techniques have previously been used to successfully improve reservoir contact and enhance production. These techniques are similar in their focus on improved reservoir connectivity by compartmentalizing the wellbore into multiple sections. They do, however, have their limitations in low-permeability or tight formations. The novel completion technique presented in this paper involves horizontal drilling through a reservoir combined with compartmentalizing the wellbore into multiple sections. Each wellbore section is then individually fractured in order to effectively propagate fractures through the reservoir, thus greatly increasing productivity in each zone. Up to twenty-four zones can be set up, allowing operators to customize their stimulation program in long-reach horizontals in heterogeneous and low-permeability reservoirs. Detailed knowledge of the existing natural fracture network, the current-day stress field, and geomechanical considerations are key inputs to a valid reservoir model, reducing the risk of establishing undesired flow paths with the aquifer, for example. This paper will illustrate how this new technology has enabled operators to benefit from significant economic improvements through operational efficiencies achieved during the drilling and completion phase based on reduced rig time and faster, more cost-efficient completions. Water shutoff options available with this new type of approach will also be discussed. Multistage fracturing leads to higher initial production, improved reservoir drainage, better control on fracture propagation, and controlled production from fractures in low-permeability sandstone and carbonate reservoirs as well as in gas-shales, which will be illustrated with case histories from these operating environments Introduction The Middle East has profited from high quality oil and gas reservoirs for many decades. Over the last couple of years operators have started assessing the economic potential of "tight?? or low permeability reservoirs as well as unconventional reservoirs, such as shale gas. Similar reservoirs have been developed successfully in other countries, ranging from the tight gas sandstones in Oman, Europe and North America all the way to the gas-shales in the US. Learnings from these plays need to be reviewed to determine their applicability to the reservoirs in the entire Middle East region since production from such reservoirs offers tremendous scope in meeting the energy needs of the Arabian Gulf, Europe, North America, India & China. The obvious obstacle in producing from tight and shale gas reservoirs is their low permeability, which requires some form of flow stimulation. In carbonates, stimulation of these reservoirs with acid through coiled-tubing is a challenge especially in long-horizontal wells as there is no effective means of deploying the acid across the entire length of the well. Further, the permeability-contrast across different sections leads to uneven stimulation of the lateral. A field proven alternative to this problem is multistage fracturing completion system.

AB  - ABSTRACTThe general features of practical application of productivity measurements from sub-surface pressure and production data for flowing and pumping wells the common sources of errors in measurement, and factors affecting the validity of the measurements are discussed. General principles involved in the identification of gas-, oil-, and water-bearing strata by the examination of cores, and practical applications of productivity determinations or correlations based on core-analyses data in primary and secondary operations, are discussed. Literature on these subjects is reviewed briefly.PRODUCTIVITY MEASUREMENTSThe determination of the productivity of wells from sub-surface pressure and production data has attracted considerable attention from engineers and operators of oil properties during the last decade. Numerous articles have been written on the various phases of the subject, and considerable useful field data have been accumulated. Productivity data are useful for determining the most satisfactory operating conditions for individual wells, and have been recognized as one of the factors for consideration in the allocation of production. The productivity characteristics of a given reservoir may be used advantageously as a factor in well-spacing problems, to obtain efficient operating conditions for wells and economical well spacing. The most important practical application of the measurements is found in the possible substitution of productivity data, as determined from sub-surface pressures and production data obtained at relatively low rates of flow, for the open-flow potential tests. Open-flow potential tests as well as pumping potential tests, in which sub-surface pressures are disregarded, may not be a true indication of the production capacity of the formation, inasmuch as such tests are dependent upon the capacity and efficiency of the equipment employed in producing the oil. The use of sub-surface pressure and production data for determining potentials makes it possible to obtain a more direct measure of the ability of the formation to produce oil, and makes unnecessary the use of oversized equipment and excessive tankage facilities which permits considerable saving in equipment costs. The premature and uneven water encroachment, which sometimes results from the large reduction in bottomhole pressure obtained while flowing at high rates of production during open-flow potential tests, also may be avoided. General application of productivity data to production practice has been delayed due to uncertainty as to whether the data were consistent enough to serve for the classification of wells and for the allocation of production. A number of factors have contributed to this uncertainty. Field data have not proved entirely consistent with respect to rate of production. The flow of oil, gas, and water mixtures through reservoir formations is not understood thoroughly. The permeability characteristics of the strata composing a given formation and the characteristics of the fluid contents of the reservoir, as well as their segregation within the various strata, have been observed to vary appreciably. Variations in the amount of the productive formation penetrated by wells and variations in well-completion practices have been observed to influence productivity data. Requirements with regard to operating conditions, care, time, and special equipment needed for properly conducting well-performance tests also have contributed to the delay in practical application of the data to field practice.

AB  - AbstractA field wide review of rig workovers was carried out for the Prudhoe Bay reservoir to enable a set of ‘best practices' to be drawn up and implemented. Particular emphasis was placed on well killing, together with the minimization of formation damage and loss in productivity index associated with rig workover operations. Clear conclusions emerge which have a significant impact on productivity as well as reducing total workover costs.The results of this case history are of direct relevance to all workover operations, detailing how cost effective well killing can be performed with the minimal productivity loss.INTRODUCTIONThe Prudhoe Bay field, located on the North Slope of Alaska, is the largest reservoir in the USA with initial reserves of approximately 11 billion barrels. It is jointly operated by BP Exploration (Alaska) Inc. and Arco Alaska Inc. First production was in 1977 and the field is now off plateau. Approximately 75 rig workovers are performed each year to maximize the steadily deteriorating well productivity.To help minimize any avoidance productivity impairment and formation damage arising from these rig workovers, a field wide review of past workover practice was performed. A wide range of workover strategies have been used within the four years covered by the review. These included killing with LCM, living with losses, as well as bullheading or circulating the well during the initial kill. This variation in past practice enabled a wide range of well killing issues to be addressed, as well as assessing the extent of any productivity impairment associated with previous rig workovers. A rising from this, the review's objective - a set of best practices for future rig workovers, was compiled.Specific objectives of the review included: the prediction of fluid loss rate in advance of a workover determining whether to bullhead or circulate during the initial kill advising whether to live with losses or prevent them by killing the well with LCM recommending which type of LCM, if any, should be used highlighting any other necessary rig workover best practices.Each of these objectives, together with the development of best practices, is discussed individually in following sections. The best practices are specific to Prudhoe Bay but they are anticipated to be applicable, at least in part, to other reservoirs.RESERVOIR DESCRIPTIONThe principal producing interval within the Prudhoe Bay field is the Permo-Triassic Ivishak formation. It is a gradual upward fining sequence of fluvio-deltaic fine to medium sandstones with thin interbedded siltstones and shales. Diagenesis has caused quartz overgrowths, siderite and pyrite to be important pore-occluding cements, as well as depositing clay minerals. Vermicular kaolin is the dominant pore-filling clay with subordinate amounts of illite and mixed layered clays [1].Permeability of the producing interval varies enormously; from approximately 10 md in the peripheral regions of the field to up to several hundred millidarcies in its best parts. Regions of the reservoir have suffered heavy formation damage; a number of wells that initially had permeabilities as high as 100 md are now showing permeabilities of less than 5 md [2].The original average reservoir pressure was approximately 4400 psi at 800 ft TVD SS [1], and currently in the main producing area it averages 3600 psi. This creates a fluid overbalance pressure of 200-300 psi during workovers, when using a seawater column of density 8.5 ppg.The average reservoir temperature is 200°F, ranging from 180°F in the north east to 225°F in the south west [1].

AB  - Abstract Well productivity decline in mature gas fields, often attributed to liquid loading, may actually be due to salt deposition, which can produce identical symptoms. Salt plugging in gas wells has been well documented in Germany and the USA and is increasingly becoming an issue in the North Sea. There is an increasing awareness amongst North Sea operators of the issue of salt precipitation in gas wells, however, a recent literature search on the subject revealed a limited body of work suitable for use as an introduction to the subject. This paper reviews the mechanisms of salt precipitation, and looks at some modelling and monitoring methods and reviews the available remediation techniques Salt problems occur over a very limited range of producing conditions and are generally seen in mature, depleted gas fields, explaining perhaps the recent increasing interest in the issue amongst North Sea operators (UK and Netherlands). Salt solubility in water decreases with both reducing pressure and temperature, such as in a producing gas well, so that salt can precipitates as saturated produced water flows up the wellbore. The solubility effects are small but are exacerbated, or exceeded, by dehydration effects as produced water enters the wellbore. Salt may precipitate and adhere to the completion walls and produce a salt bridge. Salt can plug perforation tunnels and even form within the reservoir itself. It is not solely a downhole problem, salt precipitation can occur inside surface equipment such as compressors. For production operations, early detection or prediction of salt precipitation is vital, yet it has proved difficult as the issue depends on individual well conditions. The paper discusses how diagnostic modelling may help if certain data are available: produced water salinity, operating conditions along the wellbore and reliable WGR history. Finally, the paper describes current remediation techniques to restore gas well productivity.   Introduction This paper arose as a result of the experience of trying to find a basic introduction to salting in gas wells. A simple introduction to the mechanisms and remedial methods was found hard to come by. There is plenty of experience within operating companies both in the UK North Sea and the Netherlands North Sea. Until recently operating companies have been finding there own way through salting issues. There are now organised forums both in the UK and the Netherlands where operating companies can exchange experiences. This paper aims to put forward, in one place, a simple introduction to salting in gas wells from a petroleum engineers point of view as opposed to a production chemist's take on the subject.   Salting in Gas Wells Salt Deposition Mechanism   Sodium chloride is not strictly a scale.  Most oilfield scales are formed by the mixing of incompatible waters.  Salt, however, is a self scaling phenomenon requiring only changes in physical conditions to precipitate.  It is also, generally, a gas well problem, for reasons that become apparent when looking at the mechanism of salt deposition. There are two mechanisms working to cause precipitation of salt; firstly, evaporation of fresh water from formation brine into the producing gas which increases brine salinity, and secondly, changes in pressure and temperature which can reduce the solubility of the salt in the brine. Either or both can result in the brine becoming salt saturated so that the salt precipitates out. Precipitated salt is generally nearly 100% NaCl.  Throughout the text this is referred to variously as salt or halite, the terms being used interchangeably.

AB  - Abstract This paper describes the successful ongoing process of optimizing hydraulic fracturing designs in a well campaign in Congo onshore to create best practices for continuing development. The fracture design program began by characterizing and evaluating the rock formation and its compatibility with stimulation fluids, including mineralogical and geomechanical properties, as well as regained permeability. For example, laboratory testing determined that the formation was soft and highly sensitive to water, indicating that a water-based fracturing fluid would require specialty additives to minimize formation damage. During the stimulation campaign, treatment designs were modified to optimize the final propped fracture geometry. For example, designs and operations were changed over time to relieve proppant embedment in the soft rock. In fact, post-frac evaluations demonstrate critical correlations between the final propped frac concentration and conductivity achieved versus production increase over time. The paper presents results to date and lessons learned while engineering the fracture stimulation design and execution to maximize oil production. Introduction Hydraulic fracturing, represents a great opportunity of business, it is the first time on eni's onshore field in which this technology has been applied in a massive campaign. Hydraulic fracturing operations in West Africa are not as common as in the US, Latin America and the Middle East. However, in Congo fracturing technology is spreading and has overcome more than few difficulties since the practice began: logistics and operational issues, related to the complexity of the field and even the complexity of the zones to be fractured. The most significant challenge has been the formation, which has shown through laboratory testing to be soft and strongly water-sensitive. For a recent campaign in Congo, a large number of hydraulic fracturing operations have been performed to stimulate productivity in the M'Boundi field. The success of this hydraulic fracturing campaign has been achieved by studying the reservoir to choose an initial fracturing fluid and develop some initial frac designs, and following each operation with thorough post-job analyses and carefully organizing the logistics. Currently, the contribution to the daily global production of the field, through fractured wells, represents more than 30 %, opening new horizons to the application of the technology in others eni's fields worldwide. In this paper, results of lab tests are described, allowing the identification of critical issues, such that of the formation heterogeneity, soft formation highly sensitive to water (particularly the risk of proppant embedment), the choice of fluid to be used, the equipment and the logistics and operational issues overcome in more than two years of operations and more than 60 jobs pumped. Analyses are presented to correlate some key parameters of frac jobs (conductivity of the fracture, proppant concentration) with the wells' production performance, confirming lab test results and allowing the definition of a strategy of improvement for the pumping in this type of formation, maximizing oil recovery.

AB  - AbstractGlobal shipbuilding industries are going through the substantial change after the global financial crisis, then the Korean shipbuilding companies (mostly common carrier constructors) are being in dangerous situation. Current competitiveness of the global shipbuilding industry is moving to China based on the low labor cost.Whereupon, Korean shipbuilding industry, with heavy industry as the central figure, are trying to rise the portion of the offshore plant construction for the purpose of resource development of deep sea. Meanwhile, the most outdated part of the offshore plant business of Korea is zoomed in on the development technology including FEED (Front End Engineering development) and deep water floaters comparing with the advanced companies of USA and Europe. This made the domestic government invest most of the R&D funds in product and equipment development field.However, huge loss of mega shipbuilders such as Samsung, Hyundai and Daewoo is occurring at construction stages owing to the big delay of production processes while the development engineering are being supported by foreign engineering companies. These tremendous financial losses is thought to spring from absence of management capability with respect to the huge quantity and complex outfitting works of topside structure.In this paper, we are going to investigate the strategy for the advancement of the production management fit for offshore plant business. Then, robust and sustainable technical roadmap is going to be described based on current IT technologies and simulation based management methods.

This paper provides a broad overview of the nature offormation damage problems, how they occur during various oilfield operations,and their effects on well productivity.Diagnosis of formation damage problems has led to the conclusion thatformation damage is usually associated with either the movement and bridging offine solids or chemical reactions and thermodynamic considerations. The finesolids may be introduced from wellbore fluids or generated in situ by theinteraction of invading fluids with rock minerals or formation fluids.Control of formation damage requires proper design of treating fluids forchemical compatability and strict quality control of fluid physical andchemical properties during treatment. The use of treating fluid filtration,clean work strings (pipe), and inhibited fluids has been shown to be importantin the control of formation damage during well treatment.IntroductionLaboratory and field studies indicate that almost every operation in thefield--drilling, completion, workover, production, and stimulation--is apotential source of damage to well productivity. During the many years when thecost of oil was extremely low, however, productivity damage was largely ignoredand emphasis was placed on minimizing costs rather than maximizingproductivity. Since the advent of the energy crisis and the Arab embargo,prevention of formation damage and maximization of well productivity has takenon added importance, not only for conventional well operations but also fortaking advantage of EOR. In EOR, if the conductivity of injection and producingwells is damaged, sweep efficiencies and recovery factors will be adverselyaffected. The success or failure of an EOR project may depend on the ability toinject planned amounts of special fluids and to produce oil at adequaterates.Because repair of formation damage is usually difficult and costly, thebasic approach should be to prevent damage. To achieve this goal, the entireprocess of drilling, completion, and production needs to be viewed as a whole,including extensive preplanning, execution, and follow-up. Failure to controltreatment or operating procedures and chemicals properly at any stage maynegate the effectiveness of all other well-designed and -executed operations.Severely damaged productivity may result from a single misstep in the path ofwell development.A broad knowledge of how formation damage occurs is the first step inprevention of well damage. Each operation must then be studied in detail. Thispaper takes the first step by reviewing how formation damage occurs and showinghow it affects well productivity in various operations.Relative Importance of Formation DamageFirst, let us look briefly at the relative importance of the formationcondition near the wellbore. Although the drainage radius may be severalhundreds of feet, the effective permeability close to the wellbore has adisproportionate effect on well productivity.JPTP. 131^

AB  - Abstract Rapid production decline rate is associated with the loss of fracture conductivity after hydraulic fracture stimulation. This loss of conductivity has often been attributed to the migration of formation fines into the proppant pack or the generation of fines derived from proppant crushing. Surface modification agents were introduced in the stimulation market around 1997, and according to literature published since then, these materials have been helping to sustain fracture conductivity, and subsequently, mitigating production decline rates. This paper presents long-term results from the use of these materials in hydraulic fracture stimulation operations in the Burgos Basin in northern Mexico; results from offset wells are also presented for correlation and comparison. Production from this basin comes from low-permeability sandstones normally considered tight gas formations. Introduction Burgos Basin is located in northeastern Mexico along the southern border of the U.S. This gas basin covers more than 50,000 km2 (Fig. 1) and accounts for one third of the reserves of nonassociated gas in the country. The gas fields are located along well-defined bands that extend across the shared border between Mexico and the U.S. They are complex, sandy reservoirs, higly compartmentalized, and made up of a great number of small independent blocks characterized by very low permeability. Sustaining a high production level in this area requires a large number of wells to be drilled and hydraulically fractured.1 Burgos Basin gas production started in the mid-Forties; however, its complex characteristics caused a rapid decline by the early Nineties. In 1994, a second phase began when an intensive drilling program for exploration and development was kicked off with the goal of increasing gas production. New reserves were added by improving drilling and completion methods, identifying bypassed pay, identifying field extensions from 3D seismic information, and making new exploration discoveries. Fig. 1—Burgos Basin location in northern Mexico.   Factors Affecting Fracture Conductivity Several factors affect the conductivity of a propped fracture and ultimately the productivity of a well. As mentioned, the migration of fines onto the proppant pack after a hydraulic treatment has been recognized as one of the main factors affecting fracture conductivity. This occurs when flocculation of the fines creates larger particles that result in a pack plugging. Infiltration of fines into a pack in effect reduces the conductive width of the fracture and provides a source of fines that may migrate upon stress cycling. Fines can be a product of the proppant breakdown under closure stress or they can come from the formation that is in contact with the proppant bed. Fines migration is often related to unconsolidated formations; however, it can also come from hard rocks if the fracture face crushes under the load of the proppant.2

AB  - ABSTRACTThe Nullipore reservoir in the fields of Egypt''s General Petroleum Company (GPC) is a heavy oil reefal reservoir located in the Gulf of Suez area. The Nullipore formation is characterized by a high degree of heterogeneity, which, in addition to the high oil viscosity, has made it difficult to locate and to drain oil effectively. This was further complicated by the lack of accurate seismic data. For these reasons, the reservoir was traditionally considered only as a secondary or backup prospect. Recently, an approach was initiated, based on the use of innovative logging techniques for better reservoir characterization as well as production data analysis for better understanding of reservoir dynamics. This has led to the realization that the reservoir''s productivity is primarily controlled by the flow contribution from natural fractures. New horizontal wells were hence planned and completed on the basis of the newly acquired information with excellent results. Moreover, older wells were recompleted using the data acquired from these horizontal wells, leading to large increases in production.This paper describes the methods used to locate the natural fractures that lead to the majority of production in the Nullipore reservoir. Central to these are the fracture detection logs and log-analysis methods employed. It presents a case study of one well and describes how new wells can be put in place to intercept these fractures and effectively drain the oil.

AB  - AbstractThis paper will focus on the laboratory and field challenges of maintaining productivity in a North Sea well through scale inhibitor deployment via gas lift. Calcium carbonate scale formation commonly occurs during early production of formation water and in this particular well was detected on the downhole safety valve and upper tubing. Several scale management options were considered, however, that considered most likely to succeed was inhibitor injection via the gas lift system.An extensive laboratory evaluation under the North Sea field downhole conditions was undertaken in order to qualify a suitable scale inhibitor/solvent package. While the identification of a scale inhibitor capable of controlling calcium carbonate was relatively simple, the combination of an aqueous based inhibitor with a suitable solvent package proved challenging. The initial product development stage was focused towards identifying compatible blends of various types of scale inhibitors (phosphonates, polymers and vinyl sulphonate copolymers) with different solvent and solvent mixtures. An essential aspect of the formulation design was to minimise the potential for volatile loss from the product to the dry injection gas. Several candidate scale inhibitor/solvent packages were put through a rigorous laboratory evaluation programme under the harshest possible conditions likely to be experienced in the field. From this initial review products were identified as passing pre-defined criteria and showed good environmental qualities with very low viscosities (5cP or less at ambient temperature) before and after volatile loss and had very low corrosivity (0.01mm/y). In addition, the chemicals displayed complete compatibility at concentrations in excess of 50% with the completion fluid, formation water and completion elastomers, and controlled calcium carbonate scaling at a relatively low concentration. The final part of the paper will provide details of the field deployment experiences and challenges of the gas lift scale inhibitors developed. IntroductionArtifical lift via gas lift injection is a common procedure for the enhancement of productivity in those wells with either low reservoir pressure or high water cut and is commonly used in mature fields to prolong productivity. The gas is injected into the production tubing causing aeration and hence a reduction in the hydrostatic head of the liquid column. Within the particular well that the present study was focused on the main problem was scale forming on the downhole safety valve. Under such circumstances the well had to be shut-in periodically with consequent loss of production and a dissolver job performed to remove the scale from the valve. An evaluation was undertaken jointly between the operator and service company and it was decided that the most viable option for the scale management of this well was inhibitor deployment via gas lift.A number of operators have considered the use of scale inhibitor injection via gas lift and have had varying degrees of success(1). For example, it was demonstrated by TFE that during scale inhibitor injection via gas lift in the high temperature Block 3 fields, offshore Angola that the choice of vapour pressure depressant within the scale inhibitor/solvent package was critical(2). During injection of the scale inhibitor/solvent package excessive evaporation occurred to the dry injection gas. This resulted in the viscosity of the injected product increasing significantly leading to clogging of the gas lift system. It was observed that after re-formulation of the solvent system and use of an alternative scale inhibitor that there was no clogging of the subsurface valves and no loss in productivity due to scale fomation.

AB  - SPE Members AbstractThe sensitivity of postfracture well production to fracturing fluid performance parameters (viscosity, leakoff, retained conductivity, tubular friction) is investigated. Analytic relations and numerical model simulations are used to characterize this sensitivity over a broad range of fracturing applications. It is shown that a +/-30% change in a fluid parameter will generally cause less than a 10% change in postfracture production. This result should be useful to design engineers because it indicates the accuracy required for fluid data in fracture design programs. Or equivalently, the accuracy required when these data are obtained from lab or field tests. IntroductionHydraulic fracturing is a means to an end; wells are fractured to increase production. Given this, what affect do the fluid performance parameters have on postfracture production? This is a relevant question since fracturing fluids are an integral part of every treatment. The sensitivity of postfracture production to variations in fluid viscosity, leakoff, retained conductivity, and tubular friction is investigated. The sensitivity is characterized using two different approaches: approximate analytic relations and numerical model simulations. These approaches are used because they are complimentary. Approximate analytic relations can capture general phenomenological trends in terms of simple equations. This promotes better understanding of "cause-and-effect" since the interaction of the relevant parameters is explicitly stated. However, this simplicity comes at a price. Many times it is impossible to capture the complexities of real life phenomena in closed form solutions. Numerical simulations, on the other hand, can incorporate greater complexity, but are less tractable than analytic relations when attempting to identify general system trends or when considering all permutations of inputs. To assess the impact of the fluid parameters on postfracture performance a +/-30% variation in each parameter is considered because this level of change is required to obtain a meaningful (e.g., 10%) change in production. The effects of these variations are investigated one parameter at a time. Cumulative effects resulting from concurrent variations of several parameters are not explicitly discussed. An assessment of cumulative effects requires assumptions about parameter distributions (i.e., means, variances, and whether or not the effects are independent). This consideration is beyond the scope of the paper. However, an approximate analysis in Appendix D suggests that our results are reasonable despite the fact that concurrent variations are not directly considered. Cumulative effects are found to be second order due to the dominance of only one or two of the fluid parameters. Pump rate rather than tubular friction is considered as a sensitivity variable since pump rate variations are more commonly considered than friction variations. Also, the two effects are approximately equivalent. As discussed in Appendix C, the primary consequence of tubular friction is its limiting effect on injection rates. P. 899^

AB  - Abstract The objective of this work is to assess the impact on productivity decline of altering the completion type in a deepwater Miocene reservoir. Typically to date, these types of assets have utilized Cased Hole FracPack (CHFP) completions as a basis of design. Wells in the Gulf of Mexico targeting the deepwater Miocene plays have seen significant Productivity Index (PI) decline within the first few years of production. Open Hole Gravel Pack (OHGP) and Open Hole FracPack (OHFP) completion types were selected as potential alternatives to CHFP. A coupled well, reservoir and geomechanical model was created to assess the impact of multiple potential damage components on matching the observed inflow performance from production logs. The model assesses probabilistically the weighting of each of six damage mechanisms (creep, fracture conductivity, fines migration, fracture connectivity, off-plane perforation contribution and drilling/completion fluid damage) on well performance. Based on this weighting, an assessment can then be made of their impact on the alternate completion types. Previous studies (Knobles et al. 2017) have indicated that cased hole completions are particularly susceptible to PI decline. Specifically, when unpropped perforation tunnels collapse, they reduce the inflow area into the wellbore and create a flow restriction. In higher permeability formations, the perforations not connected to the fracture (i.e. off-plane perforations) can contribute a significant portion of the well's production. It is important to note that if the connectivity and packing of the perforations is optimized and fracture is placed to within design specifications, little PI decline is observed. However, in the real world, this is not always the case. Three wells were used in this analysis. Two wells where decline was observed and a third well where no significant decline was observed. Results from the study indicated that if the two underperforming wells had utilized an OHGP completion, the PI degradation would have been mitigated. However, the upside production seen from the third well would not be attainable had the well been completed as an OHGP on an equivalent well trajectory. The results of the study also indicated that minimizing the drilling damage would be integral to the success of the OHGP completion in comparison to optimizing the completion placement in a CHFP. The paper addresses a significant issue of PI decline affecting deepwater wells and presents a potential remediation technique based on alternate completion types. The paper also presents a new methodology based on Design of Experiment to assess the contribution of various damage mechanism while incorporating the uncertainty around each based on available measurements.

AB  - Abstract Most gas condensate wells, including hydraulically fractured wells, are operated at pressures below the dew point pressure of the reservoir causing condensate to drop out and accumulate near the wellbore, thus blocking the gas production. Even for very lean gas condensate fluids, once the bottom hole flowing pressure falls below the dew point pressure, the condensate bank forms in a matter of months and leads to a rapid decline in production from these wells. In hydraulically fractured gas condensate wells, condensate can build up to very high saturations in and around the fracture which significantly reduces the productivity of these wells. Two-phase gas condensate flow measurements have been conducted under reservoir conditions in a propped fracture to study the damage caused by condensate blocking in fractures. An in situ chemical treatment has been developed to reduce the damage caused by liquid blocking of hydraulically fractured wells by altering the wettability of the proppants to neutral wet, thus reducing the residual liquid saturations and increasing gas relative permeability. A fluorinated surfactant in a glycol-alcohol solvent mixture was found to improve the gas and condensate relative permeabilities measured on propped fractures by a factor of about 2 under reservoir conditions. Introduction In gas condensate reservoirs, when the bottomhole pressure in flowing wells falls below the dew point pressure of the fluid, a liquid hydrocarbon phase commonly referred to as condensate is formed and is subsequently trapped by capillary forces. The liquid condensate, along with the connate water that is present, continues to accumulate in the rock pores thus impeding gas flow, until a critical liquid saturation is reached that is similar to the residual oil saturation that would form in the same rock under the same flow conditions. Once the critical liquid saturation is exceeded, both the condensate and gas flow towards the wellbore. The liquid continues to accumulate until a steady-state saturation is reached that is somewhat higher than the critical liquid saturation. Condensate banking can reduce the well productivity significantly, in several instances by a factor of 2 to 4. Afidick et al. (1994), Barnum et al. (1995), Engineer (1985) and Ayyalasomayajula et al. (2003) have reported field data that show significant productivity loss due to condensate accumulation. Since the reduction in well productivity is primarily associated with the reduction in gas relative permeability, a great deal of effort has gone into measuring and modeling the relative permeability of gas-condensate fluids. Initially, the studies were done at low pressure and temperature (Ham and Eilerts, 1967). Later studies were done at reservoir conditions with synthetic fluids (Kumar et al., 2006; Ayyalasomayajula et al., 2003; Henderson, 1998) as well as with reservoir fluids (Nagarajan et al., 1998). Various parameters such as interfacial tension (Haniff and Ali, 1990), high flow rates (Henderson et al., 2000; Kumar, 2006), non-Darcy effects (Henderson et al., 2000; Bang, 2007), fluid composition (Bang et al., 2006) and rock type (Bang et al., 2006) have been investigated. Several strategies have been tried and tested for stimulating gas-condensate wells with limited success (Anderson, 2005). Gas cycling (Aziz, 1983; Harouaka and Al-Hashim, 2002) allows the pressure to be maintained above the dew point but may not be economical, especially late in the life of the reservoir when large quantities of injected gas are required to maintain the pressure above dew point.

AB  - Abstract Numerous studies have concluded that connectivity is one of the most important factors controlling success of improved oil recovery processes. Interwell connectivity evaluation can help identify flow barriers and conduits and provide tools for reservoir management and production optimization. The multiwell productivity index (MPI)-based method provides the connectivity indices between well pairs based on injection/production data. By decoupling the effects of well locations, skin factors, injection rates, and the producers' bottomhole pressures from the calculated connectivity, the heterogeneity matrix obtained by this method solely represents the heterogeneity and possible anisotropy of the formation. Previously, the MPI method was developed for bounded reservoirs with limited numbers of wells. In this paper, we extend the MPI method to deal with cases of large numbers of wells and open reservoirs.  To handle open reservoirs, we applied some modifications to the MPI method by adding a virtual well to the system and by modifying the pore volume. We applied the modifications in two nonvolumetric systems where there was either a leaking zone or an isolated zone, and found the approaches using the virtual well could predict the reservoir performance accurately.  In cases with large numbers of wells, the required computational time to calculate the heterogeneity matrix may make the problem intractable. Therefore, we applied a model reduction strategy based on the location of the wells, called windowing. This technique ignores the parameters that have smaller effects on reservoir performance. We applied windowing to two cases with large numbers of wells (16 and 41 wells). We observed that, by selecting the proper window size, we can predict the reservoir performance accurately (R2 values greater than 99%) and decrease the CPU time up to a factor of 20 for the studied cases. The approaches described enabled us to provide realistic interpretations of interwell connectivity for complex cases where the simple MPI method would be difficult to apply. Integration of these approaches with the MPI method can quickly and efficiently model field data to optimize well patterns and flood parameters. Introduction Interwell connectivity evaluation determines how effectively two wells are connected to each other. This can provide useful information on reservoir heterogeneity and lead to better waterflood management. Analysis of injection and production data can be particularly useful for determining connectivity between well pairs, since flow rates are among the most common measurements made during field life. In the last two decades, several methods have been developed to analyze injection and production data and define parameters which evaluate the connectivity. Some of these connectivity parameters provide us with semi-quantitative insights to better understand the reservoir heterogeneity. For example, the correlation coefficient between the well pairs (Heffer et. al 1997; Jansen and Kelkar 1997; Refunjol and Lake, 1999) may help identify flow barriers or conduits between the well pairs. The correlation coefficient (r), however, is not fully quantitative, because if one well pair has coefficient r0 while another pair has 2r0, the latter pair is not necessarily twice ‘as connected' as the former pair.  Other, more fully quantitative parameters exist to assist us in waterflood management. For instance, l in the Albertoni and Lake Method (Albertoni and Lake 2003) and the Capacitance Model (CM) (Yousef et al. 2006; Kaviani et al. 2008; Sayarpour et al. 2009) not only gives a quantitative evaluation of the interwell heterogeneity but can be used to predict the waterflood performance. Such a connectivity parameter decouples the effect of injection rate from the data. Thus the connectivity parameter l will be independent of injection rate fluctuations. In cases where producer BHPs are available, the CM can also decouple the effect of pressure on l.  There are, however, non-reservoir effects which still affect l, such as the well spacing and skin factors.

AB  - ABSTRACT: Centrifuge physical model tests were performed to study the mode of failure during sand production and its concomitant impact on the productivity index. The tests simulated seepage-induced failure around a multi-perforated vertical well. Results indicate that in the presence of a competent cap rock (1) sand production results in the formation of a (truncated) cone-shaped enlarged cavity, (2) surface subsidence of the reservoir due to loss of sand mass may result in opening of flow channels under the cap rock, (3) for a given applied head difference, sand production ceases once the enlarged cavity lowers the flowrate to sub-critical level,. (4) flow becomes diverted towards the upper perfs where the cavity radius is largest, (5) flow rate increase varies between 5 to 10 times depending on whether the mode and volume of sanding is sufficient to result in the formation of flow channels. The study performed shows that (1) the location of perfs affects the mode and magnitude of sand production, and (2) long-term productivity can be improved through managed sand production. Presence of a competent cap rock is the key for maximizing the productivity via sanding.

AB  - Abstract Asphaltene deposition is a major formation damage issue in production wells with asphaltene problematic oil. Asphaltene can precipitate within the reservoir or in production tubing, resulting in partial or total loss of well productivity. This is especially a large concern in reservoirs with high gas-oil ratio (GOR), as more gas can dissolve in the oil and strip out the asphaltene. This anticipated asphaltene precipitation mechanism might be responsible for several partially or totally damaged wells in Field-A with asphaltene precipitation. An extensive laboratory study including solubility tests, saturate aromatic resin asphaltene (SARA) analysis, compatibility tests and coreflood experiments was performed in this study. Solubility tests were conducted at reservoir temperature (220 °F) and elevated pressures using asphaltene obtained from a bailer sample to determine the effectiveness of different solvent systems. SARA analysis was performed to assess the stability of the reservoir oil of interest. Compatibility tests and coreflood experiments at reservoir conditions were also conducted to assure solvent system compatibility with formation fluids. In addition, other factors including the overall cost and environmental impact were taken into account in choosing the most suitable solvent system. Initial lab testing presented a number of candidate solvent systems with high asphaltene solvency power. Some solvent systems were ruled out because they were damaging to core permeability as indicated from the compatibility tests and coreflood experiments. A case study of two successful chemical treatments performed on Well-A with a time interval of more than two years is presented in the paper. The first treatment was successful in restoring productivity of Well-A while the second one was able to remove the partial organic deposition damage with a cost saving of 60%. Using the selected solvent system, a two-stage remediation procedure was implemented to dissolve the organic deposition in the horizontal open-hole section of this well. The first stage included bullheading the solvent, allowing it to soak for 24 hours to clean out the tubing. The second stage involved injecting the solvent in the open-hole section using coiled tubing (CT) with jetting/pulsing mechanism. Results showed an increase in the wellhead pressure by 40% and consequently well productivity, indicating the successful dissolving of the organic deposition. This paper presents a new methodology in incorporating all the mentioned analytical techniques into choosing the most proper and cost effective asphaltene treatment solution for a specific reservoir to have a successful field treatment.

AB  - Summary Producing natural gas from shale-gas reservoirs presents a great challenge to petroleum engineers owing to the low-permeability nature of this type of gas reservoir. Large-scale and expensive hydraulic-fracturing operations are often required for enhancing gas well productivity. Because of the shaly characteristics of the reservoir rock, the hydraulically fractured gas wells are vulnerable to damage by fracturing fluids. However, the true significance of the formation damage in shale-gas reservoirs is still not clear. It is highly desirable to have a simple method for predicting the degree of fracture-face matrix damage and for optimizing fracturing treatments. This paper is meant to fill this gap. A new mathematical model was developed in this study to predict the effect of fracture-face matrix damage on the productivity of fractured gas wells in shale-gas reservoirs. A unique feature of the new model is that it considers reservoir/fracture crossflow in finite-conductivity fractures. Results of the model analyses were sensitized to reservoir properties and facture-face matrix-skin properties determined by the fracturing-fluid properties and treatment conditions. Large ranges of possible leakoff and spurt-loss coefficients were investigated. We concluded that, in the ranges of reservoir and fluid properties used in this study, well productivity should drop by less than 15% even if the residual matrix permeability is reduced to only 5% of the virgin reservoir permeability in the damage zone. Neglecting the resistance to flow in the fracture will overestimate the effect of matrix damage on well productivity. The well-productivity drop caused by matrix damage is most sensitive to the invasion depth and damaged permeability.

AB  - Abstract Unconventional reservoirs have characteristics that differ from traditional conventional reservoirs. The productivity profile of an unconventional well can be significantly different from a conventional well, in that the production rate declines faster in an unconventional well. Therefore, properly planned well operations are crucial to optimize costs and production from these shale assets. This includes understanding the reservoir physics, planning optimal well spacing, improving well performance from completions, and simulating refracturing effects on well production. This paper presents a new multidisciplinary method to help improve field performance and productivity in unconventional reservoirs. A multidisciplinary approach is necessary for economical and successful operations in unconventional reservoirs. In unconventional fields, wells are drilled quickly; therefore, rapid decision-making is necessary. Currently, fracture modeling is performed using either fine local grid refinements or dual-porosity dual-permeability models, which can be cumbersome and time-consuming. This paper presents a new approach that uses multiple shale-specific features and unstructured models, which allows users to specify discrete natural fracture networks (NFNs) and hydraulic fractures with arbitrary orientations connected to practical well trajectories. The automated gridding technique significantly simplifies the workflow, thus allowing users to focus on addressing issues in the engineering space by streamlining the setting up of complex reservoir simulation models. The approach is applicable to black oil and compositional models of all fluid types. Using parallel capability, performance can be enhanced severalfold. The new approach helps enable modeling of multiple scenarios by modifying parameters easily; thereby, results are readily available to help operators plan optimal well and fracture spacing and length. This paper highlights how well productivity can be improved by optimizing well placement and incorporating the effect of NFNs and hydraulic fractures.

AB  - IntroductionThe effect of aging on work capacities is resulting is a global decline of work productivity due to combined absenteeism and “presenteeism” (i.e., being at work but not being productive). Altered physical capacities associated with age-related conditions such as arthritis, impaired balance and coordination, degenerative disc disease, diabetes, heart disease, and cancer are creating special demands and challenges for Safety Professionals today. Ergonomics alone will not effectively address this growing problem.The impact of an aging workforce is being felt globally with the make-up of the labor force changing significantly in the past 50 years. By the year 2010, an unprecedented 25% of our work population will reach 65 years old or older! There are economic burdens as well. The ratio between the worker and the retired person is changing dramatically. In 1950, there were 7 workers per every retired elderly person. By the year 2030, there will only be 3 workers for every retired elderly person.More alarmingly, the younger generation of workers that are beginning to replace baby boomers in the work force appears to be less fit than their predecessors with resulting obesity and obesityrelated disorders such as type II diabetes, arthritis and degenerative disc disease becoming pandemic at a much earlier age. All of these trends will be translated into more on-the-job injuries, illness-related absenteeism, disability and reduction in productivity.It is the opinion of the author that the Safety Professional must be prepared to be on the front line to combat these alarming trends. Modern medicine today in the United States still remains too reactive to be fully effective, too often treating symptoms rather than the causes. The real answers and solutions to the impending health crisis lie in integrated safety programs that incorporate ergonomic, behavioral-based safety, and wellness interventions that can effectively reduce the occurrences of MSDs and improve health of employees.Preventing Musculoskeletal DisordersIncidences of musculoskeletal disorders (MSDs) are on an increase as the working population ages and comprise one of the largest problems in industry today. Spinal disorders, particularly those of the lower back and neck, are very prevalent today and can lead to permanent disability and chronic pain in an aging work force. After low back and neck injuries, shoulder injuries rank third in prevalence. However, the good news is that almost all MSDs are preventable.The cause of the vast majority of MSDs today is related to how we work (ergonomics) and how we live (lifestyle). The majority of MSDs can be directly related to poor ergonomic practices involving awkward, stressful postures, improper material handling, and highly repetitive motions. Poor lifestyle habits that lead to obesity and declining physical fitness with loss of flexibility and muscle support of the spine and extremities also contributes significantly to these problems. By understanding and applying good ergonomic practices, modifying poor work and lifestyle behaviors and improving physical fitness (lifestyle), the vast majority of MSDs can be prevented.Risk Factors for MSDs:A.

AB  - Abstract Using large-scale hydraulic fracturing experiments on tight shale outcrops we identified three dominant regions controlling stage production: (1) the connector between the wellbore and the fracture system, (2) the near-wellbore fracture and (3) the far-wellbore fracture network. The particular nature of these regions may change depending on the play, the reservoir fabric, its relation to the in-situ stress, and the distribution of rock properties. However, these regions are always well differentiated. Understanding the role of each of these components, to hydrocarbon production, is fundamental to identify the dominant sources of loss of fracture conductivity and accelerated production decline. The conditions promoting the loss of fracture conductivity, fracture face permeability and surface area in contact with the reservoir vary significantly along the length of the hydraulic fracture. By separating the induced fractured area into three characteristic regions of reservoir contact, we isolate the dominant drivers of loss of production per region, and obtain the best compromise for sustained stage productivity. We used large-scale hydraulic fracturing experiments to develop and validate the concept. These were integrated with scaled-down measurements of fracture conductivity, proppant embedment and the effect of rock-fluid sensitivity. We find that the critical conditions for productivity for the wellbore-connector depends on mechanical stability considerations and are independent of reservoir quality. The critical conditions for productivity from the near-wellbore fracture are solids retention in the proppant pack, and reduction of fracture face permeability due to proppant embedment. The critical conditions for productivity from the far-wellbore fracture are loss of surface area and retention of fracture conductivity. Results provide a framework for improving fracture design for improved long-term productivity. This is achieved by understanding the conflicting requirements between three regions of flow within the fracture and selecting the optimal compromise between these.

AB  - Abstract The Vincent project is a heavy offshore oil field developed by subsea multilateral wells with sand control. This paper will provide an insight into how completion practices were developed to maximize well productivity and how they were balanced against risks for constructing multilateral (ML) junctions. The fluids used for drilling and cleaning up open-hole laterals can have a significant impact on well productivity in standalone screen applications, especially with respect to sand screen plugging. This paper details the development of open-hole fluid selection and clean up practices for completing long 2000m+ horizontal laterals with standalone screens. The Vincent wells are more complex due to drilling tri-lateral wells that include two TAML level 5 ML junctions requiring open-hole connections. The paper identifies the key risks for installing the ML junctions in a weak formation including risks imposed from clean up practices. The paper reviews the lessons learned during execution, how the ML junction installation risks were mitigated and how the Vincent wells were delivered with a well performance meeting expectation.

AB  - Shale gas formation is sensitive to high water saturation due to its ultra-low porosity and permeability, if too much fracture fluid were held up into the formation, water block and formation damage phenomenon will happen. In Fuling shale gas field, a lot of wells get ultra-low flowback rate without causing any water block or productivity loss even shows an increasing tendency in productivity with a lower flowback rate. Focusing on this unusual phenomenon, pore-fracture system properties in Fuling were investigated by experiments under multiscale. The pore-fracture system and imbibition characteristics are the key mechanisms. we divided pore-fracture system in Fuling into four levels, among which highly developed bedding fractures and micro-fractures in Fuling play vital role in the enhancement of imbibition capacity of the formation and help keep high conductivity of the fracture system before and after fracturing fluid recovery. We also find Graptolite fossils in the key that make bedding fractures unique in Fuling.

AB  - SPE MembersAbstractDamage to proppant pack and formation permeability can drastically decrease well production. In many cases the damage is due to inconsistent degradation of gelled stimulation fluids and residual filter cake on the formation face. Several methods have been employed with limited success to remove polymeric damage in an effort to increase well productivity.A new technique utilizing polymer specific enzymes has been developed to facilitate removal of polymeric damage. The new, environmentally safe, remedial treatment can be applied over a wide pH range and at temperatures as high as 300 F. Laboratory analysis has shown that multi-fold permeability improvements can be achieved through polymeric damage removal with the new system.A case study of several low productivity wells suffering from polymeric damage was conducted. Production histories and return flow analysis were evaluated to characterize the damage and guide the remedial treatment design. The case histories of several wells treated with the remedial polymeric damage removal treatment demonstrate multi-fold improvements in well productivity.INTRODUCTION AND STATEMENT OF THE PROBLEMPolymers are widely used in drilling, completion, and stimulation applications as additives to provide friction reduction, viscosification, particle transport, fluid loss control, and zonal isolation. The residual effects of the insufficient degradation of polymers utilized in drilling, completion, and stimulation fluids has been identified as a primary contributor to permeability damage. Damage to the formation and/or proppant pack permeability can significantly decrease the hydrocarbon deliverability and hence, impair well productivity.Guar-based polymers are used extensively in hydraulic fracturing applications to provide the necessary transport properties to deploy the proppant into the fracture. The polymers are typically too large to penetrate the formation matriX and, consequently, are concentrated within the fracture due to dynamic fluid loss during the pumping treatment and fracture volume reduction upon closure. These concentration phenomena result in the formation of filter cakes which are elevated concentrations of polymer deposited on the fracture face and within the proppant pack. The concentration of these filter cakes can range from about 5 to greater than 25 times the surface polymer concentration depending on the reservoir properties, treatment design parameters, proppant concentration, and location in the fracture. Filter cakes with polymer concentrations of this magnitude are of high viscosity, low permeability, and practically insoluble.P. 591

AB  - AbstractThe loss of brine to the hydrocarbon formations has been one of the majorconcerns during well completion operations. Fluid-loss control pill scontaining sized particulates, such as CaCO3 or sized salt, have often beenused. However, damage to the formations and gravel packs by the solids due tosolids invasion often causes reduced production and an expensive workover. Thecleanup of the carbonate pill is often ineffective, especially in longintervals, since the reaction between acid and carbonate is too fast for theacid to cover the entire zone. Therefore, a reliable viscous fluid systemwithout solids is more desirable than a particulate system. Inhigh-permeability reservoirs, a highly crosslinked gel is needed to achievegood fluid-loss control hydroxyethylcellulose (HEC) is known for its lowresidue content and difficulty to be crosslinked. A highly elastic zirconiumcrosslinked HEC gel is achieved by using an activator and a chelant. A delayingagent is used to adjust the timing of the crosslink process. The gel is capableof stopping fluid loss in formations of 2 darcies and above at temperatures upto 290 F. Internal and/or external breakers can be used to reduce the gelviscosity to near water consistency.P. 215

AB  - During the past 6 years, there have been several significant improvements in gravel-pack techniques. This paper reviews some of these improvements and discusses some other factors that should be considered in a gravel-pack application. Introduction Sand production in Louisiana Gulf Coast Miocene wells has been a serious problem since the development of fields in this area began. It is a more serious problem today with the high production rates allowed and the development of younger sands that appear to be finer and contain more silt and clay particles. Much of the research in the early studies of sand control by gravel packing was pointed toward sands with a relatively small amount of fine sand pointed toward sands with a relatively small amount of fine sand and silt. Sands of this type are relatively easier to control because the main concern is determining a gravel size that will restrain the formation sand. The reduction of pack permeability by fines earlier was thought not to be serious because the gravel had extremely high permeability and the interface between the formation sand and gravel had substantially the same permeability as the formation sand. This is not the case in most of the unconsolidated sands found in the Gulf Coast area. It has been demonstrated that invasion of the pack by fine sand can have a serious effect on well productivity. For this reason, the gravel has been sized to minimize the invasion problem. However, the use of smaller gravel requires more careful planning in the design and execution of the job. The use of smaller gravel may require a larger perforation area or, in some cases, an open-hole completion may be required. Smaller gravel is also more susceptible to permeability reduction caused by mixing with perforation debris and formation sand during placement, New perforation debris and formation sand during placement, New placement techniques have helped to solve the contamination placement techniques have helped to solve the contamination problems while performing the gravel pack. Productivity in problems while performing the gravel pack. Productivity in gravel-packed wells also may be impaired by the use of completion fluids that are damaging to the gravel pack. In wells where the reservoir pressure gradient is greater than 0.61 psi/ft, it has been common practice to complete with drilling mud. The reason for this practice was that a safe, nonpolluting brine was not available. The development of calcium-chloride/calcium-bromide brine has made it possible to complete wells with pressure gradients up to 0.785 psi/ft using a low-solids workover fluid. Gravel-Size Selection One of the most important aspects of designing a gravel pack for maximum productivity is selection of the gravel to be used. Where formation samples are not available, a blanket recommendation would appear to be to use the smallest gravel possible without restricting productivity. When representative samples are available, size selection can be based on formation particle-size distribution. To assure effective sand control and longer-lived gravel packs, it appears that the gravel should be sized to prevent invasion of the gravel pack by the finest formation sand. The particle-size distribution generally is obtained by sieve analysis of formation samples. The frequency and type of samples taken have been shown to be of considerable importance. Of the several types of samples available, rubber-sleeve cores generally are accepted to be the most representative. A sample taken from production lines or equipment can contain excess fines because of production lines or equipment can contain excess fines because of hydraulic separation. JPT P. 1259

AB  - Abstract Poststimulation operations on multistage hydraulically stimulated horizontal wells producing from conventional and unconventional reservoirs have a major impact on long-term well performance. Most common types of poststimulation services on such wells include plug drillout (PDO) operations and well flowback (WFB) operations. During these operations, the hydraulic fracture system experiences major changes in pressure and flowrate, which may affect the well's long-term productivity. Among the many mechanisms responsible for decrease in well productivity, we highlight 1) the risk of losing the connection between the wellbore and hydraulic fracture system because of the development of an unpropped area; 2) rock destabilization, and 3) the risk of scaling and precipitation. In this paper, we describe an integrated engineering and operations workflow for optimizing poststimulation operations on horizontal wells by controlling the productive fracture system evolution during the poststimulation period. The approach is based on applying the secure operating envelope (SOE) concept, which provides a set of operating parameters that ensure preservation of the connection between the hydraulic fractures and wellbore. The SOE is defined for each individual well, using a combination of geomechanical and multiphase transport modeling. It accounts for reservoir properties, well completion, and fracture treatment parameters. High-resolution, real-time monitoring of well performance and active control of bottomhole conditions through choke management ensure the well is operated within the SOE. The production objectives combined with the evolution of the SOE enable an overall strategy for poststimulation operations. The paper outlines how the SOE is constructed. Applications of the proposed approach on horizontal oil and gas wells in unconventional reservoirs in North America are reported, both during well flowback and plug drillout operations. Using the SOE during well flowback helps to predict and avoid a decrease in well production performance caused by excessive proppant flowback which results in creation of near-wellbore pinch points inside hydraulic fractures. Additionally, plug drillout was identified as a critical operation, during which the proppant pack can be destabilized. The associated risk was strongly reduced by applying the SOE concept in combination with high-resolution monitoring. Based on data obtained from more than 50 operated wells, we conclude that the proposed methodology, including application of geomechanical modeling to poststimulation operations, brings significant opportunities for optimization of well performance and securing long-term well productivity.

AB  - Summary Less than half the fracturing fluid is typically recovered during the flowback operation. This study models the effects of capillarity and geomechanics on water loss in the fracture/matrix system, and investigates the circumstances under which this phenomenon might be beneficial or detrimental to subsequent tight-oil production. During the shut-in (soaking) and flowback periods, the fracture conductivity decreases as effective stress increases because of imbibition. Previous works have addressed fracture closure during the production phase; however, the coupling of imbibition caused by multiphase flow and stress-dependent fracture properties during shut-in is less understood. A series of mechanistic simulation models is constructed to simulate multiphase flow and fluid distribution during shut-in and flowback. Three systems—matrix, hydraulic fracture, and microfractures—are explicitly represented in the computational domain. Sensitivities to wettability and multiphase-flow functions (relative permeability and capillary pressure relationships) are investigated. As wettability to water increases, matrix imbibition increases. Imbibition helps to displace the hydrocarbons into nearby microfractures and hydraulic fractures, enhancing initial oil rate, but it also hinders water recovery. The results indicate that fracture closure may enhance imbibition and water loss, which, in turn, leads to further reduction in fracture pressure and conductivity. Results also suggest that more-aggressive flowback is beneficial to water cleanup and long-term oil production in stiff rocks, whereas this benefit is less prominent in medium-to-soft formations because of excessive fracture closure. Because no direct correlation between high initial oil-flow rate and improved cumulative oil production is observed, measures for increasing oil relative permeability are recommended for improving long-term oil production. This work presents a quantitative study of the controlling factors of water loss caused by fluid/rock properties and geomechanics. The results highlight the crucial interplay between imbibition and geomechanics in short- and long-term production performances. The results in this study would have considerable impact on understanding and improving current industry practice in fracturing design and assessment of stimulated reservoir volume.

AB  - AbstractThe Nullipore reservoir in the fields of Egypt's General Petroleum Company (GPC) is a heavy oil reefal reservoir located in the Gulf of Suez area. The Nullipore formation is characterized by a high degree of heterogeneity, which, in addition to the high oil viscosity, has made it difficult to locate and drain oil effectively. This was further complicated by the lack of accurate seismic and geological data. For these reasons, the reservoir had been traditionally considered only as a secondary or backup prospect. Recently, an approach was initiated, based on the use of innovative logging techniques for better reservoir characterization as well as production data analysis for better understanding of reservoir dynamics. This has led to the realization that the reservoir's productivity is primarily controlled by the flow contribution from natural fractures. New horizontal wells were hence planned and completed on the basis of the newly acquired information with excellent results. Moreover, older wells were recompleted using the data acquired from these horizontal wells, leading to large increases in production.This paper describes the methods used to locate the natural fractures that lead to the majority of production in the Nullipore reservoir. Central to these are the fracture detection logs and log-analysis methods employed. It also details how new wells can be put in place to intercept these fractures and effectively drain the oil.Introduction to carbonate reservoir characterizationCarbonates house a variety of complex particles, including a huge variety of biological origins, and an even more complex pore size distribution. The typical carbonate rock is made of grains, matrix and cement. Grains are either skeletal fragments of small organisms or particles precipitated from calcium-rich water. Matrix is the lithified mud of deposition that fills most of the space not occupied by grains. This mud has several sources: chemical precipitation, break up of skeletal material into finer material, replacement of limestone by dolomite; stylolitization, the formation of stylolites, irregular planes of discontinuity between rock units due to compaction-related pressure solution with concentrated fine-grained insoluble residue along their irregular seams (Park, 1968); and fracturing, the planar breaking up of rock mass due to stress anisotropy (Nelson, 1981). Upon lithification, mud becomes a very fine-grained calcite called micrite. Cement is the crystalline material that forms in most of the space remaining between grains and matrix or between grains themselves, binding them. Cements may have a variety of crystal sizes depending on its composition, the conditions of crystallization and the spaces to be filled.The classification of the numerous ways in which matrix and grains can coexist is key to characterization of any carbonate reservoir. The Dunham classification (1962) is the one that has most successfully withstood the test of time. Based on the internal structure and texture of the rock, Dunham classified a spectrum of rock types (Fig.1): Mudstones consist mainly of matrix in which relatively few grains are suspended. Wackestones are also matrix-supported but have more grains. Packstones have enough grains for them to start providing support with the matrix filling the remaining non-pore space. Grainstones have plenty of grains providing support and include progressively less matrix. Finally, boundstones describe carbonate rocks in which the original material provided support during deposition, such as in reefs. Furthermore, a crystaline rock is more crystalline rock is one that has lost its depositional fabric because of diagenetic recrystallization.

Abstract "Superfrac" is a new hydraulic fracturing technique described by Kiel which involves fracturing wells with mixtures of viscous oil and water carrying large propping agents. In the process the water provides an annular ring in the wellbore which minimizes friction losses and pumping horsepower requirements and permits the generation of long, wide, highly permeable fractures. The present paper summarizes the field use of "Superfrac" in the first 248 field jobs for Humble. Overall, the technique has been found to be highly successful in stimulating oil wells with 237 jobs on oil wells giving an initial production increase of 13,697 BOPD and a stimulation ratio of about 3 on the basis of production volumes. These results have been obtained on jobs conducted throughout the United States and are discussed according to geographical area. Examples noteworthy results have been experienced when using "Superfrac" in deep wells and in highly permeable reservoirs. The technique is marketed under the names of "Super Frac", "Superfrac", and "Super Sand Frac." For convenience in this paper, it will be referred to as "Superfrac". Introduction Hydraulic fracturing is a stimulation technique that has become widely used by the oil industry since its introduction about 20 years ago. In a hydraulic fracturing treatment, fluid is injected into the well at rates higher than the reservoir matrix will accept. Rapid injection produces a buildup in wellbore pressure until a pressure large enough to overcome rock stresses is reached. At this pressure, failure occurs allowing a crack or fracture to be formed. Continued fluid injection with selected proppants results in a high conductivity crack in the formation and thereby well stimulation. The key to stimulate by fracturing is altering the flow pattern of the reservoir from radial to one which approaches linear flow. McGuire and Sikora conducted analog simulations of the productivity of vertically fractured wells. Their results are the basis for predicting the stimulation available from fracturing (Fig. 1). The degree of stimulation (productivity index ratio) is a function of fracture conductivity relative to formation conductivity and propped fracture length as it relates to drainage radius. It is the propped fracture length and fracture conductivity propped fracture length and fracture conductivity that are of primary importance in effective fracture design.

AB  - Abstract The workflow for mature-field redevelopment requires a multidisciplinary team to analyze, select, and rank well candidates for intervention and production optimization. An objective evaluation of the well's productivity and reserves is essential for identifying possible alternatives to increase production. For this study, an analysis was conducted on 152 wells from the Carito field. As the second-largest oilfield producer in the Maturin sub-basin of eastern Venezuela, the Carito field encompasses approximately 150 km2 and comprises the El Carito and Carito south reservoirs. The Carito reservoir presents a high degree of heterogeneity resulting from complex, compressional faulting and varying sediments and includes hydrocarbons containing gas, condensate, volatile, black oils, and tar mat (oil mixed with wet sand). The Carito south reservoir behaves like a black-oil reservoir. The workflow presented in this study identified 20 candidate wells ranked by their potential to increase production. An intervention plan was then defined and ranked according to technical and economic criteria. This paper presents the successful application of this methodology in the Carito field to improve well productivity by approximately 7,000 bpd, proving that the method can be easily adapted to other areas.

AB  - Abstract The main challenge of perforation completion is to provide communication between the wellbore and the undamaged reservoir through clean perforation tunnels. To achieve this, two key technologies were implemented for tubing-conveyed perforation (TCP) in workover wells in a mature field in Western Siberia. First, the application of dynamic underbalanced perforating achieved clean perforation tunnels, resulting in improved production. Second, the placement of a nondamaging viscoelastic surfactant-based (VES-based) pill after perforation avoided reservoir damage during the well kill operations through clean perforation tunnels. Three wells in the mature Van-Egan oilfield were selected as candidates for the perforating project. Two wells were previously perforated with standard charges, and the third well was to be perforated across a new layer. Deep penetrating charges were used to bypass near-wellbore damage and maximize potential results. A customized TCP test string for 6 5/8-in. (168-mm) casing was implemented with two sets of gauges installed at different depths. The gauges included a downhole shut-in valve for a closed chamber test, a production valve for the inflow surge, and a fill-up valve for improved run-in-hole procedures. The TCP test string was designed to conduct a perforation inflow test to estimate post-perforation skin factor, productive zone permeability, and reservoir pressure. For the third well with 5 3/4-in. (146-mm) casing, a modified toolstring was used due to operational restrictions. After perforation, a novel, nondamaging solids-free VES-based fluid was used as a fluid loss control pill to protect open perforation tunnels during the subsequent workover operations. Several critical parameters such as permeability, bottomhole temperature, possible scale and emulsion formation, specific gravity, and stability time required were assessed to find the best pill formula for each well. This approach successfully protected clean perforating tunnels against damaging kill fluids for 3-5 days of workover operations. Results showed negative skin values for reperforated intervals and slightly positive skin values for the new perforated interval. Improved loss control was reported after spotting the pill. Zero losses were achieved in a low-permeability reservoir; loss rate observed in the reservoir with high permeability was lowered by more than a factor of 4. Post-job production data showed an increase in oil rate of up to 2.5 fold compared with the preworkover rate.

AB  - SPE Members AbstractRecent advances in biotechnology have led to the identification and isolation of polymer-specific enzymes. This new technology has been incorporated in the development of improved damage removal systems. The polymer specific reactivity of the new systems provides environmentally safe polymer degradation without causing damage to the formation or tubular goods. Polymer specific systems have been developed for removal of damage caused by polymers such as cellulose, guar, and starch. The treatments can be applied over a wide range of downhole conditions to polymeric damage resulting from fracturing, gravel packing, or workover operations. Fracture conductivity and core flow evaluations have shown that multi-fold improvements in permeability are achieved with the new systems. Damaged wells treated with the new systems have experienced up to three-fold improvement in well productivity. A detailed study and analysis of laboratory and field data are presented. IntroductionPolymeric damage to proppant pack and formation permeability can significantly decrease well production. The damage, in many cases, is due to insufficient degradation of drilling, completion, or stimulation fluids and the dynamically formed filter cake on the formation face. A filter cake is a dense, practically insoluble concentration of polymer deposited on the fracture face. The presence of filter cake may impede flow, dramatically reducing the productivity of the well. Several studies have shown that the concentration of polysaccharides within a filter cake can range from about 10 to greater than 25 times the surface polysaccharide concentration of the stimulation treatment. For instance, if a fracture treatment fluid contained an original polymer concentration of 40 pounds per thousand pounds (ppt), the filter-cake concentration could easily be 500 ppt. The obvious goal, therefore, exists to reduce or remove the polymeric damage in order to obtain the optimum productivity the stimulation treatment was intended to provide. STATEMENT OF THE PROBLEM Various methods have been used to remove damage in an effort to increase well productivity. Several previous studies describe the application of conventional cleanup treatments. P. 577^

AB  - AbstractPhysical model experiments of sand production and productivity change in open hole, single wrapped screen completions have been performed. Synthetic and outcrop weak sandstone samples containing a drilled vertical scaled borehole with a concentric single wrapped screen in place were tested under conditions of realistic formation stresses and radial fluid flow. The increase of the drawdown and depletion, by raising the effective external stresses and the pore pressure gradient, to conditions by far exceeding the formation collapse stress, resulted in productivity reductions. The differential fluid pressure over the screen did, however, never exceed 10 kPa; which is negligible compared to the near-wellbore formation pressure drop. The variation of the screen-formation annular clearance and the mismatch of the screen slot opening to the formation grain size distribution did not alter the productivity significantly. However, transient sand production through the screen occured when the screen slot opening was oversized. The productivity was, however, reduced when the screen-formation annulus was gravel-packed.IntroductionThe planning of well completions is in many ways an optimisation of the well's inflow performance and the sand production risk1. The inflow performance, as expressed through the near-wellbore skin, affects significantly the productivity of the well through inflow restrictions caused by e.g. poor mud filtercake removal, mud filtrate, near wellbore scaling, and water breakthrough. Indeed such restrictions may lead to increased drawdown to maintain economical production rates. On the other hand increasing drawdown provokes sand production and formation collapse near the wellbore. This implies that a reliable sand control method must be implemented, most often in the primary completion of the well. In particular in subsea template wells or gas wells a high level of security is required. Normally, this security is paid for by reduced well productivity, which may have dramatical economical impact. An additional concern is the long term ability of the sand control device to resist the downhole environment in terms of mechanical action due to formation collapse, chemically aggressive fluids, erosion of slot openings and grain packs, etc. These leads in many cases to the introduction of extra barriers to improve the lifetime of the completion, which again lead to productivity loss.Depending on the environment, various methods such as external and internal gravel packing, plastic consolidation, open hole pre-packed liner completion and open hole single screen completion have been used by the industry in order to control sand production during production. The success experienced with the different methods varies, depending on several factors as formation grain-size distribution, pore-lining clay mineralogy, in situ stress states, drawdown and depletion, hydrocarbon properties, mechanical properties of the formations, flowback of drilling fluid contaminants during production, etc.

AB  - Abstract Great breakthrough has been made in heavy oil EOR mechanism under water injection at different state. New findings from both experimental and theoretical studies provide strong support for the broad application prospect of steam in heavy oil EOR. In this paper, a series of studies are carried out on productivity of a horizontal well with several vertical steam injectors during the steam-assisted-gravity-drainage (SAGD) process. In this paper, a novel topic is discussed on the effect of steam state on oil productivity during the SAGD process. The injection wells are three parallel vertical wells and the production well is a horizontal well. The numerical method is adopted to reveal the physical aspect mechanisms. Some meaningful conclusions are listed below. (a) The usefulness of superheated steam in heavy oil recovery lays in its chemical reactions with heavy oil and rock minerals. The effect of physical heating on oil recovery efficiency is weak. (b) The oil production rate at the starting stage, from 0 day to 30 day, is oscillating with time due to the fact that the preheating stage is neglected. The connectivity between injectors and producer is poor without a necessary step of preheating. (c) The direction of oil recovery is from well-bottom of the injector to the well-head and then to the places between the injectors. (d) Chemical reactions may play an important role in oil recovery efficiency if the final recovery efficiency by injecting steam with higher steam quality is several order of magnitude than that by injecting steam with lower steam quality. We carried out the pilot study on the effect of steam state on heavy oil EOR during the SAGD process with several vertical injectors. More importantly, the pilot study conducted in this paper provide the very basis for the application of superheated steam for oil companies and following academic research in the field.

AB  - Abstract Reciprocal Productivity Index (RPI) is graphical production analysis method that provides us with the technique/ability to estimate descriptive engineering parameters, such as permeability, skin, drainage area, and to generate production forecasts and reserves based on those parameters, without the cost of full numerical simulation or extended buildup tests. The method's theoretical basis arises from the fact that traditional constant rate or constant pressure (potential) boundary conditions are sufficient, but that the necessary boundary condition only requires that the sandface transmissibility remain constant over time. With that difference, it is possible to accurately evaluate production histories, in which both the rate and pressure are varying over time, using traditional well testing methods. The reservoir average pressure can also be evaluated from routinely available rate and flowing pressure production data, using an extension of this reciprocal productivity index method. Traditionally, reservoir average pressure could only be determined from an extended duration build-up test. This procedure generally tends to underestimate the pressure, due to practical limitations on shut-in times. In addition, an error in the reservoir average pressure determination results in an error in the computed skin for the well. However, this new procedure provides an independent evaluation of skin and pressure so that they are not dependent on one another. The theory for the method is in the appendix. This paper explains how we used this technique to evaluate engineering parameters and validate the estimated reservoir pressure using reverse material balance. Introduction For very practical reasons, such as stimulation design, reserves assessment, etc., direct knowledge of the reservoir average pressure would be extremely useful. Currently, the only method available is to conduct an extended build-up test. It must then be evaluated using the classic Horner1 or possibly Miller, Dyes and Hutchinson2 evaluation procedures. This process has several serious limitations, especially the loss of revenue and damage to the well3 arising from the extended duration shut-in. Particularly in tight reservoirs the low permeability bias the predicted pressure (called P*). As a consequence of using the procedure outlined in this paper, the longstanding concern that the classic build-up analysis for "P*" underestimates the actual reservoir pressure is being confirmed. The realization that reservoir average pressure could be estimated from production data became apparent from the many example production histories evaluated with the Reciprocal Productivity Index method4,5 (RPI).

AB  - Abstract Raageshwari gas field is located in RJ-ON 90/1 Block in western India with Cairn Oil & Gas, a vertical of Vedanta Limited as operator of the field. Multistage hydraulic fracturing is required to achieve commercial production from the highly laminated retrograde gas condensate reservoir. It has been observed in almost all wells that the top high PI zones produce a majority of the gas. The wells have a water column across bottom few fracs which prohibits production from these zones. Water unloading through increased drawdown was not successful because of higher PI of the upper fracs. Coiled tubing-based nitrogen lift of the water column is not commercially feasible. It is important to find a low-cost solution for water unloading since bottom zones account for approximately 30% of total gas in place. A solution has been developed using a customized velocity string design, which can unload the water while maintaining high well production. Conventional velocity strings are only installed in late life of gas wells when liquid loading is observed. These conventional designs limit the maximum rate to 2-3 MMSCFD and therefore cannot be used in Raageshwari gas field for water unloading as high individual well rates (8 to 12 MMSCFD) is required to meet field plateau production. After reviewing various options, an innovative and unique velocity string system design was developed which incorporates a customized surface spool and string hanging system. This customized design allows combined or independent gas flow conduits as described below: Through the annulus of velocity string and tubing when higher gas rates are required. Through the velocity string to facilitate liquid unloading due to high gas velocity. Production from both the conduits to meet higher demands than the annulus flow alone. Well integrity was assured by maintaining two independent barriers during commissioning, production phase and also during future string retrieval. This paper will discuss in detail the design considerations of the velocity string and surface hanger system to achieve liquid unloading while maintaining high rate gas production. It will also have details on the dual barrier selection process and the design customization that have been done to ensure cyclic liquid unloading and high rate gas production. This innovative velocity string design is technically a dual completion with a much lower cost and footprint. The same design can be implemented across a wide variety of applications to address well integrity issues, selective zonal production etc. The application of this design in Raageshwari field will ensure planned recovery of gas from the field and will also support plateau production phase. This design can be an efficient and economic technique to develop similar fields.

AB  - AbstractWell productivity can be significantly reduced by permeability damage. The damage in many cases is due to inadequate degradation of gelled treating fluids and the residual polymeric filter cakes on the formation face. Several methods have previously been employed to remove polymeric damage in an effort to increase well productivity with limited success.Polymer specific enzymes have been incorporated into a newly developed technique to facilitate removal of polymeric damage. The new remedial treatment is environmentally safe and can be applied over a wide pH range and at temperatures as high as 300 F. Laboratory analysis using the new system has shown that multi-fold permeability improvements can be achieved through polymeric damage removal.A case study of several wells suffering from polymeric damage was conducted. Production histories and return flow analysis were evaluated to characterize the damage and guide the remedial treatment design. Several wells treated with the polymeric damage removal treatment demonstrate multi-fold improvements in well productivity.INTRODUCTION AND STATEMENT OF THE PROBLEMDrilling, completion, and stimulation applications frequently employ polymers as fluid additives. The polymers are used to provide friction reduction, viscosification, particle transport, fluid loss control, and zonal isolation. The polymers are typically either starches, celluloses, or guars. Once the desired polymeric performance has been satisfied, the polymer must be removed from the productive zone in order to achieve the optimum well productivity. Otherwise, the insufficient degradation of polymers can lead to significant permeability damage. The residual effects of polymers in such applications have been identified as a primary contributor to well productivity damage.Hydraulic fracturing applications extensively utilize guarbased polymers to provide the necessary transport properties to deploy the proppant into the fracture. Since the guar polymers are too large to penetrate the typical formation matrix, they are concentrated within the fracture due to dynamic fluid loss during the pumping treatment and fracture volume reduction upon closure. The concentrated polymer deposited on the fracture face and within the proppant pack is known as filter cake. Depending on the reservoir properties, treatment design parameters, proppant concentration, and location in the fracture, the concentration of the polymer within the filter cake can range from about five to greater than 25 times the surface concentration.P. 491

AB  - This paper was presented as part of the student paper contest associated with the 2010 SPE Annual Technical Conference and Exhibition. Abstract Lab test of polymer-based in-situ gelled acids reveal that polymer and other additives separate out of the acid when these acids are prepared in high salinity water. In coreflood tests, in-situ gelled acid formed a gel inside 20??. long core samples, and the acid changed its direction several times. Unexpectedly, the core's permeability was reduced at low shear rate. Wormhole length increased as the shear rate was increased, while the diameter of wormhole increased as the acid cumulative injected volume was increased. CT scan indicated the presence of gel residue inside the and around the worm hole. Gel residue increased at low shear rates. Material balance on the cross-linker indicated that a significant amount of the cross-linker was retained in the core. Based on the results obtained from this study the in-situ gelled acids should be used only at low HCl concentrations (5 wt% HCl). Acid should be prepared in low salinity water. Acid injection rate should be determined based on the expected shear rate in the formation. A core flood experiment is recommended to confirm optimum injected rate. Flow back the well to minimize the residual gel inside the formation. The data obtained in our study can be used as a guideline for injection rate selection. Introduction Diversion in carbonates is generally more difficult than in sandstones because of the ability of the highly reactive HCl to increase permeability in carbonate rocks as the acid reacts with the rock and generates new flow channels. When injected, the acid tends to follow the path of least resistance that is to the higher permeability and/or the least damaged zones. Since damage must be removed or bypassed from the entire producing interval, effective acid placement techniques must be employed. Unless effectively diverted, the treated region eventually becomes the sink for the acid and leaving other regions not adequately acidized. Apart from particulate diverters, a number of methods and techniques are commonly used for acid diversion in matrix treatments including: mechanical (packers, bridge plugs, ball sealers, coiled tubing); and chemical methods (gelled acids based on polymers or viscoelastic surfactants, emulsified acids and foams), Chang et al. (2008). Chang et al. (2007) showed that mechanical techniques are more expensive and time consuming than chemical techniques and they are often not applicable nor effective in open-holes. They stated that acid placement should not cause formation damage, be compatible with the treating fluids (overflush or displacement fluids) and formation brines, clean-up rapidly and completely when the well is put back on production, and be stable at the bottom hole treating conditions. The present study will focus on acid diversion using in-situ gelled acids that are based on polymers. Polymer-based in-situ gelled acids are known as self-diverting acid or viscosity control acid that uses pH to control a cross-linking reaction between a polymer and a multi-valent cation. De Rozieres et al. (1994) showed that increasing the viscosity of acids reduced the diffusion coefficient of the hydrogen ion (H+) and, as a result, the rate of mass transfer of the acid into the rock surface will decrease. The polymer and/or the generated gel forms an external filter cake that can reduce the leak-off rate of the acid during acid fracturing treatments. Mirza and Turton (1995) showed that polymer-based systems were firstly used for blocking zones to help the gel plug reach to the desired stiffness and the required isolation between intervals. Polymer Gel Diverter (PGD) had been used on field for many injection wells, which help in reducing the skin factor from +1 to -2.5. Yeager and Shuchart (1997) demonstrated that in-situ gelled acids that are cross-linked by iron(III) formed a gel at a pH value of nearly 2. Conway et al. (1999) mentioned that the in-situ gelled acid was very viscous, especially in the pH range of 2-4.

AB  - Abstract The Joint Chalk Research (JCR) initiative is set up by a group of operators and partners in the Southern North Sea. The objective of the initiative is to increase the ultimate recovery in their respective chalk assets to 60%. Analyzing the different production technology options used in the assets thus far was the next step in better understanding the different recovery increment options. The initial 4 year productivity from 4 assets was analyzed. This paper presents the results of a study focused on increasing the understanding of productivity drivers using a database on well productivity related to different completions, stimulations and production options. The database contains 56 wells from 4 different assets and 750 acid and proppant treatments in 663 perforated intervals. It was found that the absolute total production per interval is similar for all assets; however the drawdown applied in 1 asset is 4 times lower than the other assets. The performance of the wells in most assets dropped strongly over time, except in the low drawdown asset. It was found that in addition to transient effects, it is likely that a decline in hydraulic fracture completion efficiency also contributes to this decrease in production performance. The low drawdown asset has a much better normalized production performance than the other assets. Other factors might also influence this result, however, compelling evidence has been found that the much lower drawdown may cause the better performance over time. The normalized recovery of propped fracced wells was better than the acid treated well in 2 of 3 assets using both stimulation types. The higher recovery of the propped treatments was mainly from better productivity over time compared with the acid fracture treatments. However, the initial productivity of the acid fractured well was much better, hence the economic balance could still tip to the acid treatments. The analysis showed that, for all assets except one, there is a significant difference in the performance of acid fractured wells and propped fractured wells over time. Indications are that production declines are not only due to depletion, but also related to deterioration of the completion efficiency as a function of pressure drawdown and suboptimal efficiency of acid treatments. An extensive statistical analysis indicated a strong dependency on asset grouping, which hampers the extrapolation of experience from one asset to the others. Introduction This paper presents a study on well productivity from chalk fields in the North Sea as a function of different stimulation, completion and production techniques. The objective of the study was to enhance the understanding of productivity drivers by developing, and analyzing a database on well productivity related to different completions, stimulations and production options. The focus of this study was on a technical and statistical analysis; the economic evaluation of the well productivity was specifically left out of this study. However, all the necessary data for an economic evaluation (except a few cost items) can readily be retrieved from the database. All assets included in this study are situated in the Southern Central Graben in the North Sea in relative close proximity to each other. The assets are producing oil from chalk depositions, about three kilometres below sea level. The hydrocarbon bearing formations were formed in the late Cretaceous, early Paleocene, about 60 to 70 million years ago. The formations were formed in a shallow to open marine depositional environment.

AB  - Abstract Accurate forecasting of condensate well deliverability usually requires good knowledge of the gas condensate vapor – liquid properties. Condensate well deliverability is particularly important as it impacts downstream issues such as the number of wells required, surface gas handling facilities, drilling schedules and income from gas sales contracts. A new approach for forecasting viability of gas condensate wells and calculating condensate gas ratio (CGR), using simpler techniques is presented. The calculation uses a volumetric balance model for reservoir system, standardized and modified correlations, equation of state and a vapor-liquid equilibrium technique. The technique has been extended to include mass transfer and also to allow for the changes in produced fluid composition due to the formation of the condensate bank. The approach will provide a useful tool for rapid forecasts of condensate well performance, for examining the effects of condensate blockage in different well types or for studying sensitivities. It is also valuable where simple models of condensate reservoir performance are required for use in integrated studies.

AB  - SummaryThe Eldfisk oil field is a high-porosity, low-permeability reservoir of soft chalk in the Norwegian North Sea. Commercial oil production from the Eldfisk field is dependent on well stimulations. To date, pseudolimited-entry acid stimulation (PLEAS) has been the standard completion technique. This technique initiates relatively high (5,000 BOPD) individual-well oil-production rates. Over time, however, many of the Eldfisk wells have experienced rapidly declining oil production characterized by wellbore skin increase and fracture closure. Solids production and casing collapse have also been problematic. In late 1997, an alternative completion technique involving four hydraulic propped-fracture stages was successfully executed in an Eldfisk horizontal well. This paper presents a simple methodology to evaluate sustained productivity enhancement of propped fractures vs. acid stimulations in soft chalk formations based on the use of analytical modeling in combination with empirical production-data analysis.IntroductionSince the early 1970s, petroleum engineers working on North Sea chalk fields have been challenged to design well-stimulation treatments focused on hydraulic fracturing of fragile chalk formations. Such stimulations are necessary to get the low-permeability chalk formations to produce economically. Conventional acid stimulations have been tried on all the chalk fields. Both field experience and research1 have shown that acid stimulations render attractive near-term oil production; however, for some of the chalk fields, the medium-term production period is poor. The falloff in production is attributed to low hardness and the homogeneous nature of the chalk, whereby the near-wellbore cavities and etched fracture surfaces created by the acid stimulation collapse with increasing stress.To date, there has been oil production from more than 10 chalk fields in the North Sea. Geographically (starting with the southern North Sea Danish chalk fields), after starting with acid-stimulation treatments, there have been more than 100 propped-fracture treatments placed in horizontal wells in the Dan field.2 Offset to the Dan field is the Gorm field, which also has used hydraulic propped fractures in some of its water-injection wells.3 Further north, still in Danish waters, the South Arne chalk field-development strategy has focused on the drilling of horizontal wells with completions involving multiple propped fractures.4 Propped-fracture stimulations in Norway were introduced successfully at the Valhall chalk field.5 The evolution from exclusive use of acid stimulations to propped fractures for the referenced fields has centered on one mutual goal, namely productivity preservation.For the four oil-producing chalk fields (Edda, Ekofisk, Eldfisk, and Tor) located furthest north in the North Sea - deemed the Greater Ekofisk Area - it was concluded that for most cases, the optimum stimulation technique is PLEAS.6 This conclusion was based on studies that indicated that propped fractures would not be successful because of excessive proppant embedment in soft chalk. However, in 1997, a propped-fracture "pilot" was pumped in an Eldfisk well to help further the understanding of efforts toward individual-well productivity preservation. This paper describes the Eldfisk declining-productivity problem and its symptoms and examines the root causes of the problem. A possible remedy to the problem based on the pilot performance for a well with hydraulic propped fractures is reported.Eldfisk Field BackgroundThe Eldfisk field is located in the southern section of the Norwegian North Sea, in Block 2/7 (Fig. 1). The Eldfisk field was discovered in 1970 with the drilling of Well 2/7 1X. Estimated field fluids in place are 2.8 billion bbl of oil and 4,600 Bscf of gas. The initial stock-tank oil gravity was 37.3°API. The undersaturated oil had an initial pressure and temperature of approximately 6,800 psia and 268°F, respectively, with an Rs value of 2,590 scf/STB and a viscosity of 0.11 cp. The field came on production in 1978 and was on primary production until the year 2000, at which time a waterflood was initiated in addition to gas injection of excess volumes above transportation capacity. Through the year 2000, the field produced approximately 440 million STB of oil. It is estimated that 30% of the oil produced to date is from the rock-compaction mechanism, 30% from gas influx, 20% from oil expansion, and 20% from water influx.Well Stimulations.Over the past 30 years, many new drilling and completion techniques have been tried in the development of the North Sea chalk fields. However, stimulation design has not changed considerably at Eldfisk since 1985. A standard treatment includes alternating stages of gel (200 to 300 bbl), 28% hydrochloric acid (150 to 250 bbl), and overflush (100 to 150 bbl). Diversion is achieved with 1.3-g/cm3 ball sealers. Today, the Eldfisk reservoir, as with all the Greater Ekofisk chalk reservoirs, is stimulated with massive, high-rate, multistage PLEAS treatments. The perforating technique involves clustering perforations in 2- to 3-m intervals, where each interval is separated by 10 to 12 m. As explained by Snow and Hough,6 a limited-entry design is one in which the perforations are limited to create high friction pressures in the perforations. The perforations behave like a backpressure valve, ensuring that high pressures are applied across all perforations and that breakdown of the entire interval occurs. The PLEAS technique has proved highly effective for the more consolidated chalk reservoirs. However, for the chalk fields with the highest initial porosities, acid stimulations are often destructive to the medium-term vitality of individual wells.The Problem and Its SymptomsThe main problem addressed here is the rapid decline of production in many Eldfisk wells following acid stimulations. Symptoms of the problem include casing deformations and solids flow in individual wells.

AB  - AbstractFormation damage in horizontal wells, often open hole completed, is a critical point for oil fields developed in deep offshore where acceptable development costs are based upon a limited number of highly productive wells. This paper describes a simplified numerical approach to model filter cakes removal by natural cleanup when the well is put under a drawdown pressure difference. A flow simulator taking into account the near well permeability variation has been developed using cylindrical grid with very small gridblocks around the well. Laboratory data obtained on sandstones damaged with an oil-based mud have been used as input data to model filter cakes removal by natural cleanup. The purpose of this modelling is to optimize the applied drawdown pressure to study the variation of well productivities as a function of the pressure drawdown to get the best possible well performance preventing sand production problems in poorly consolidated formations. IntroductionDeep offshore reservoirs are usually developed in very severe conditions, and so, their development costs are pretty high. The profitability of such developments requires a production scheme involving a limited number of wells having very high productivities and acceptable life-spans of several years without any dramatic interruption. To reach these objectives, horizontal well of great length are generally considered. These wells are mostly completed open-hole (non cemented), avoiding any possibility of efficient remediation or stimulation in the case of an important damage would be created in the vicinity of the wellbore. Therefore, the clean up of these wells when put initially into production must resorb the greatest part of the damage generated during drilling and completion operations. An additional complication comes from the fact that these wells can exhibit sand production from the formation when drilled in non or poorly consolidated reservoirs (turbidites) if the clean up process is not carefully optimized. The questions are: which pressure drawdown has to be applied and according to which procedure? In this paper, a simplified methodology is proposed to simulate the flow of a single liquid phase, namely oil, in the close vicinity of an horizontal well during its clean up period when a pressure drawdown is imposed between the wellbore and the reservoir formation. This work constitutes a first approach in order to provide qualitative information on the capacity of self cleaning of a horizontal well drilled in an oil pool with an oil base mud. Numerical results are presented that shows the influence of the pressure drawdown imposed during the clean up period on both the velocity of the produced oil at the wellbore and the respective contribution of contrasted permeability zones on the total flowrate of the well. The presence of an external filter cake together with an internal damage zone due to mud filtration is also studied. Ultimately, these results will be used within a more complete wellbore modelling that will include other features such as sand grain pulling from the reservoir formation.

AB  - Abstract In developing most deepwater fields with limited number of wells, intelligent well systems which consist of many valves and sensors are employed to maximize production capacity under facility constraints. Analysis of sensor data unaffected by wellbore effects allows operators to estimate key reservoir parameters, well capacity and calculate actual flow rates at zonal level. Decisions for operational control is made based on data analysis, the result of which is used to optimize overall field performance and maximize return on investment. Understanding pressure sensors placement issue is important from pressure-transient analyses viewpoint. Pressure gauges should ideally be placed as close to the perforations as possible to ensure the pressure data is unaffected by friction in the tubing between the perforations and pressure gauges but placement of the gauge is dictated by completion hardware configuration and can be located far away from the point of reservoir fluid entry. This may result to potentially erroneous measured pressure data and may lead to the calculation of inaccurate reservoir parameters and an overestimated mechanical skin value from pressure buildup response. One of the main operating constraints in deepwater wells is flux limit which is a practical well surveillance tool used to monitor and operate sand control completions, maintaining each producing interval at a maximum safe operating rate, and also monitoring well impairment to allow for proactive remedial operations. Since the flux limit is a function of mechanical skin, if the mechanical skin is over estimated because frictional losses are not properly accounted for, well production may be unnecessarily constrained. In this paper, analysis was done using a wellbore/reservoir simulator to account for frictional effects in the tubing between the perforations, and the gauge for a field example. Sensitivity analysis was also carried out at different flow rates for each well and simple correlations were developed for predicting frictional effects. Results obtained from calculations showed that pressure gauges placement effect is significant as flow rate and gauge distance from perforations increases. Correcting for this effect increased the flux limit thus increasing production rate on several wells that were previously flux constrained. Introduction For the past two decades, the oil and gas industry has been actively pursuing the implementation of remotely operated well completions which consists of many valves and sensors to monitor, analyze and control flow condition and provides solutions to production and injection problems at zonal level. This technology, referred to as "intelligent completions,?? has advanced rapidly over the years showing positive benefits including accelerated oil production, increase in ultimate recovery and reduced water handling cost, which result in significant benefits in net present value of a project. Savings from reduced well intervention provide further payback, particularly for multilateral, subsea, or unattended platform wells. Application of this technology has continued to expand rapidly especially in large deepwater fields because of the value these completions has demonstrated in maximizing production capacity under facility constraints.

AB  - Abstract XYZ, a marginal carbonate field in Western Offshore India was undertaken for development recently. During its exploration phase, around two decade ago, thick oil layer was discovered with high sour gas content (around 14000 ppm). The reservoir was delineated in small oil pool, where six wells were completed for production, including one water injector for pressure maintenance to support oil recovery. Production behavior of most of the wells had a unique response of rapid decline in short period of time with similar drastic loss in THP without any change in water cut. Production response of all these wells led the suspicion of near well bore skin development as the primary reason behind sharp decline in production. Acid treatment as a quick fix solution in carbonates was ruled out because of possible communication with bottom aquifer; coil tubing had multiple operational challenges in such a high H2S environment. Hence, to overcome the challenges and perform root cause analysis, it was planned to carry out the best possible set of data acquisition with rigless operations and plan ahead for productivity improvement and design future intervention as well. Production Logging, being an ideal diagnostic tool, was chosen to study the production profile and understand the reservoir and well behavior. Post analysis, a relatively new concept of selective stimulation with post perforation controlled dynamic underbalance technique was considered to be the best fit solution to address the skin and production decline problem in the field. The technique proved to be very beneficial and provided substantial increase in the wells production. The skin debris obtained in the process were analyzed to identify the cause of skin development and production plunge. Based on the results, further interventions were carried out in the well, which again proved to be very efficacious and increased the field production significantly. The paper has a detailed discussion on the root cause analysis and arriving to the appropriate solution for this kind of wells. It emphasizes on the importance of production logging prior to operation for better and successful planning and execution of the well intervention jobs leading to production gain. It also highlights the operational challenges in such hostile high H2S environment and the importance of planning and preparation to ensure safety of one and all.

AB  - AbstractThe Eldfisk oil field is a high porosity, low permeability reservoir of soft chalk in the Norwegian North Sea. Commercial oil production from the Eldfisk field is dependent on well stimulations involving hydraulic fractures. To date, pseudo limited entry (PLE) acid fracturing has been the standard completion technique that initiates relatively high (5000 bopd) individual well oil production rates. Over time however, many of the Eldfisk wells have experienced rapidly declining oil production. The main causes of the decreased well productivity are attributed to hydraulic fracture closure, solids production and casing collapse. Initial calculated skin values of -4.5 on average increase annually at a rate of +0.6. Through year 1999 over 100 casing deformations have been logged in the reservoir. The root problem behind the productivity deteriorations is the Eldfisk field soft chalk nature where the Brinell Hardness Number (BHN) is commonly less than 5 for the most productive zones. In late 1997, an alternative completion technique involving four hydraulic propped fractures was successfully executed in a horizontal well. Evaluation of rate-time flow efficiency for the propped fractured well versus acid fractured wells with the use of an analytical model is reported in this paper. In addition, the analytical model is used to run predictions of increased multiple propped fractures. This paper relates formation BHN to the hydraulic fracture design criteria and concludes that productivity for hydraulic propped fractured wells in soft chalk formations is preserved over time to a greater extent versus the current standard PLE acid fracture technique. This paper concludes that an additional horizontal well with eight hydraulic propped fractured zones is warranted to improve understanding of the cost effectiveness of this alternative oil recovery completion technique for the Eldfisk chalk field.IntroductionSince the early 1970's, petroleum engineers working on North Sea chalk fields have been challenged to design well stimulation treatments focused on hydraulic fracturing of the low permeability, fragile chalk formations all the while with an eye on costs. Fracturing is necessary to make the low permeability chalk formations produce economically. Conventional acid fracturing has been tried on all of the chalk fields. Both field experience and research (Ref. 1) have shown that acid fracturing render attractive near term oil production, however, for some of the chalk fields, the medium term production period is poor. The fall off in production is attributed to low hardness and homogeneous nature of the chalk whereby the etched surfaces of the hydraulic acid fractures close with increasing stress. To date, there has been oil production from over ten chalk fields in the North Sea. It would be convenient if one standard well completion would serve all the fields, however each individual North Sea chalk field has its own unique static and dynamic rock parameters that dictate optimum completion design. Geographically, starting with the southern North Sea Danish chalk fields, after initially stimulating with acid fracture treatments, there have been over 100 propped fracture treatments placed in horizontal wells in the Dan field (Ref. 2). Offset to the Dan field is the Gorm field, which has also utilized hydraulic propped fractures in some its water injection wells (Ref. 3). Further north, still in Danish waters, the South Arne chalk field development strategy has focused on the drilling of horizontal wells with completions involving multiple propped fractures (Ref. 4). The advent of propped fractures in Norwegian chalk reservoirs was first introduced at the Valhall field (Ref. 5). The evolution from exclusive use of acid fracturing to propped fractures for all of the above mentioned fields has centered on one mutual goal, namely productivity preservation.

AB  - Abstract The advances in hydraulic fracturing technology and horizontal well completions have led in recent years to rapid rise in exploitation and development of tight gas and shale plays all over the world, and particularly in North America. The popularity of new field technology has in fact raised many new questions. In particular, for forecasting the productivity and EUR of multifractured horizontal wells, it is not clear if conventional reservoir simulation concepts can be adapted for modeling or if extra physics must be included to obtain realistic solutions. This paper presents various methods to model multifractured horizontal wells in tight gas sands using a conventional reservoir simulator coupled with geomechanics. Two actual wells in the same formation but with different fracturing techniques (i.e., X-link gelled water fracs and un-gelled water (slick water) fracs) are studied. Detailed investigation of the role of fracture conductivity, effects of initial permeability level and net pay thickness, assumed size of the stimulated reservoir volume (SRV), and pressure or stress dependent permeability of the SRV and virgin reservoir were carried out by history matching the rate and cumulative production. It was established that i) history match is not possible without use of stress or pressure dependent permeability and ii) permeability dependence of pressure inside stimulated reservoir volume must be larger than in the rest of the reservoir. It was also observed that the standard method for using the same geomechanical data both in uncoupled reservoir and coupled geomechanical model will give incorrect results in terms of cumulative production. A new method based on uniaxial deformation theory is proposed to more accurately approximate the geomechanical effects in conventional reservoir simulators without running a fully coupled geomechanical simulator. The results from uncoupled reservoir modeling using the new method for correcting the permeability data for poroelastic effects were remarkably similar to rigorously coupled geomechanical modeling. This work will be of importance to engineers in analyzing and forecasting production performance of multifractured horizontal completions using numerical models. It will allow engineers to use uncoupled (conventional) reservoir modeling as a practical approximation of more complex coupled geomechanical models.

AB  - Conventional hydraulic fracture stimulation technique has been widely used to enhance the production from tight gas reservoirs. Since the initial use of this method to increase production rates, the industry has seen a continue advancement in fracturing theory, fluids and techniques. The use of carbon dioxide (CO2) since early in the 1960’s has continued to be significant part of these advances. CO2 has been used for many years as an energy source to aid in fluid recovery of well stimulation fluids. This technology predominantly has been used to stimulate the tight sandstone reservoirs. There are very limited applications for low permeable tight carbonate reservoirs due to complexities associated with the physical and mechanical properties of carbonate rocks and its interaction with fracturing fluid. Nevertheless the advantages of using assisted CO2 stimulation fluids as the elimination of potential formation damage normally associated with fracturing fluids and very rapid cleanup are still present. This paper outlines one of the first acid fracturing jobs assisted with CO2 conducted on a tight gas well reservoir in Saudi Arabia. It describes in simple manner the screening methodology and key parameters considered to select a well candidate, passing throughout the design process which it was based on petrophysical, mechanical and chemistry properties of the formation and the respective interaction with treatment fluids. Moreover, main operational procedures and guidelines are covered which aim to highlight the safety risk assessment point of view.  By implementation of this technique in a more generalized way into the field, there is a good chance to incorporate considerable operational and cost time; CO2 used to energized fracturing fluids can increase the productivity of the well while using less water and less acid than conventional acid fracturing which is of primary importance in this harsh environment requiring less water consumption.

AB  - AbstractMany soft sandstone formations are completed with horizontal wellbore. The drilling fluid, water based mud, filter cake is left in place until the completion operations are finished. At that time, a cleanup fluid is pumped to remove the filter cake deposition from the wellbore face. These cleanup fluids can be acid, specific enzymes, oxidizers or acidic water. Reservoir heterogeneity complicates the cleaning process. There is a need for a slow, efficient method to remove filter cake, without affecting the integrity of the formation.In this paper, a comparison of various cleaning methods was conducted in the lab (using ceramic disks, core plugs) and in the field. Chemical analysis for core effluent and well flowback samples after various treatments was conducted. These tests included: Anthrone method for carbohydrates, and full analysis of the produced solids using acid solubility, XRD, and SEM.Results, Observations and ConclusionsBased on extensive lab studies, a chemical treatment that is based on specific enzymes was selected and applied in three horizontal wells drilled in an acid-sensitive sandstone formation. Acid is the best fluid that can remove the filter cake, but, cannot be applied in long horizontal wells because of reservoir heterogeneity. Based on the return permeability measurements in the lab, the retain permeability after cleaning with specific enzymes fluids exceeded 85%. Mechanical cleaning using water jetting is less efficient than chemical treatments.ApplicationThis paper describes field work done to optimize the performance of enzyme treatment in a sandstone reservoir. It also discusses the importance of well flow back analysis and how it can be used to enhance the outcome of enzyme treatments. The permeability of the reservoir ranging from poor to good. Also, the average porosity ranges from 4 to 8 vol%. The bottom hole temperature of the gas reservoir is 248 °F and the length of the target zone is nearly 6,300 ft. Field treatment resulted in significant increases in gas production, without affecting the integrity of the formation.Technical ContributionsOptimization of filter cake removal based on field dataLessons learned from analysis of well flowback samples following various mechanical and chemical treatmentsIntroductionWell A is located in Field M in the eastern area of Saudi Arabia. This well is completed with a perforated/slotted liner.1 It is completed as a horizontal gas producer. All gas wells in this field have the ability to deliver a significant quantity of sweet and condensate gas, Table 1. The openhole log data of the horizontal interval indicates that the formation contains mai0nly sandstone, Fig. 1.Most of the wells in Field M are drilled using water-based mud. The drill-in fluid used to drill most of the target zone is comprised of XC-polymer, starch and sized calcium carbonate particles, Table 2. Potassium chloride is added for clay control and to minimize problems associated with fines migration. XC-polymer provides non-Newtonian behavior. This behavior is highly desirable because of the flat viscosity profile it produces in annular flow, which is required for efficient cuttings lifting in lower density mud. Table 3 gives the mean properties of the drill-in fluid used.Starch is used to control fluid loss in water-based mud ranging from fresh water to saturated salt to high-pH lime mud. Xanthan gum and starch are subjected to bacteria attack unless protected by high salinity or bactericide. The weight ratio of starch to xanthan polymer in the drilling fluid ranges from 1:1 to 1:2. In many of drilling fluid formulations, the fraction of starch is larger than the fraction of viscosifing polymer (XC-polymer), and thus removal of starch alone from the filter cake can reduce both the flow initiation pressure and the permeability impairment significantly.2

AB  - Abstract The need for oilfield operators to verify that wells are being produced at their optimum capacity and in a cost effective manner is always a priority. The need for total well management to reduce operating costs, increase oil production and increase net income from wells requires an integrated analysis of the pumping system including the performance and interaction of all the elements: the reservoir, wellbore completion, and the downhole pump. Well Completion is typically designed to assure certain oil flow rate whilst producing manageable volume of water to ensure good reservoir sweep efficiency and management. Completion design is always based on collected production data of forecasted reservoir performance of changing pressure and water cuts. As oil fields mature with subsequent increase of water cut and decrease in pressure, artificial lifting is becoming a vital mechanism for maintaining the production plateau of the field. With the emergence of the inflow control devices (both passive and active), the thrust for artificial lifting is delayed due to the delay of onset of water production or reduction of water volume produced. Very recently, the industry has looked into combining artificial lifting with controllable inflow devices. This paper addresses the different optimization scenarios of well completion in high productivity wells considering the life cycle of artificial lift systems (mainly ESP's) and different flow control mechanism. The paper highlights cases of applications extreme values of water gravities. In addition, underlines the economic viability of artificial lifting due to maintaining production and reducing cost in some applications.

AB  - Abstract A field development project in the central part of the Ordos Basin began in 2011 with the intent to develop commercial production from the two main gas producing intervals. The gas layers within the Shihezi and Shanxi Formation within the South Sulige field are low permeability (0.1 mD) with moderate volumes of gas in place that require hydraulic fracturing to be commercially viable. The early application of technology to minimize development costs and surface impact included multiwell pad-drilling to enhance drilling, completion, and operational efficiency. Fracturing cycle times were reduced by the implementation of multiwell hydraulic fracturing processes, while not compromising well productivity. To date, 33 well pads have been completed which represents more than 280 vertical wells and 13 horizontal with more than 600 hydraulic fracturing stages being done within the previous three years. The wells completed have encountered a largely heterogeneous field that has resulted in a sizable amount of data being collected. To improve on this phase of the project, a fieldwide study of fracturing performance has been performed and includes the quantification of dimensionless productivity index (JD), dimensionless fracture conductivity (CfD), and dimensionless proppant number (Np). This analysis was performed on various well types, completions types, and fracturing design approach to benchmark performance. Analysis shows some improvements were made since the initial years of the project with designs starting to approach an optimum, but more significant advances can be made. Subsequent design adjustments and well optimization were done with improved understanding of postfracture performance derived from fracturing performance type curves. This paper will discuss the optimization of the fracturing design through use of JD. The discussion will mainly focus on the use of the JD type curves and accumulated production performance to determine optimal proppant and half-length for improvements in future fracturing designs.

AB  - Abstract Very limited studies were done on the superheated steam-assisted-gravity-drainage (SAGD) process. Besides, study of the effect of physical heating of steam at different state on the productivity during the SAGD process has not been reported. In this paper, a numerical model is proposed to reveal the effect of physical heating on the productivity of a horizontal well pair during the SAGD process. Results show that: (a) the temperature increase of superheated steam plays a weak influence on the productivity of a horizontal well pair during the SAGD process. (b) the heated area increases with the steam quality, while the increase of the heated area under superheated steam injection is not obvious compared with the heated area when the steam quality is equal to 1.0. (c) as the mobility of oil in the steam chamber increases, the fraction of oil produced from the steam chamber increases, and the pressure near the production well increases. (d) when the steam quality increases or becomes superheated steam, the mobility of the oil in the steam chamber increases, and the supply rate of oil near the production well gradually become larger than the decrease rate of oil in the same region induced by elastic energy. This study provides a The paper offers a comprehensive insight into the SAGD process, and helps petroleum engineers for SAGD project design in heavy oil reserves.

AB  - AbstractA common method used to design acid treatments on acid-soluble formations isbased upon the use of "reaction times" and fracture calculations. Two of thedifficulties involved in utilizing this technique are the variable reactionrates of acid under different well conditions and the problem of determiningleak-off coefficients.One approach to controlling these factors is to prevent reaction with theformation and restrict leak-off until all the acid is in place. This can beaccomplished by plating the formation fractures with a dispersible film priorto the introduction of acid to the fracture system. Laboratory data and fieldresults using this approach have indicated favourable results.Laboratory tests were made on several types of spearhead fluids andadditives. This test information is shown and discussed in the way it pertainsto the particular spearhead and acid chosen for use in the field.Also discussed are the advantages and use of the spearhead film technique inthe placement of acid in a formation. It is expected that this approach will,in many cases, provide more reliable fracture calculation for more effectivetreatment design.IntroductionHydrochloric acid has long been one of the prime materials used instimulating limestone and dolomite reservoirs. Of the many acid treatmentsdone, most can be conveniently divided into two basic classifications: (a)matrix acidizing, in which the acid flow is confined to the naturalpermeability and porosity of the formation; and (b) fracture acidizing, inwhich the primary avenue of acid travel is through natural or induced formationfractures. This paper is concerned with the aspects of fracture acidizing.In a well, a zone of local wellbore damage can be responsible for a severeloss of productivity. Once this is removed or by-passed, substantialpenetration of the acid is required to give a productivity increase of two tothreefold over that obtainable from the untreated formation. Radialpermeability improvement, as obtained with matrix acidizing, would requireprohibitive quantities of treating fluids to reach such a distance from thewell bore. It has long been recognized that more reasonable volumes arerequired if the acid is used to create and etch a highly conductive fracture tothe desired depth in the formation.

AB  - New dimensions of environmental loss and escalating liabilities following Macondo have catapulted environmental risk to a key feature on the corporate balance sheet. Forecasting expected losses of critical environmental functions, which underpin society, is setting new challenges insurance underwriters and scientists. A critique of recent case histories will be presented to illustrate the latest dimensions of future risk needs. International operators wrestle with the dollar value of reputational risks of uncharted frontier areas with sensitive marine ecosystems which affect both stakeholder confidence and the stock price. Governments now recognize the criticality of managing environmental capital and services when dealing with new energy concessions in sensitive coastal zones. International efforts to develop “state of the art” techniques to quantify the spectrum of ecosystem services will be presented together with a critique of how readily these can be factored into decision making. Advances in global geographic information systems and satellite imagery illustrate the unprecedented future opportunities to measure ecosystem functions and changes. A series of case histories will illustrate cutting edge approaches to dealing with oil spill risk for offshore assets revealing environmental resource risk exposure, risk reduction, consequences and future liabilities. The criteria used to determine “environmental damage or loss” are fundamental to our approaches to corporate risk management. Our understanding of the role of factors such as: biodiversity; ecosystem robustness; recoverability; habitat uniqueness; species population status and life cycles in the sustainability of ecosystem services will be reviewed and reveals fundamental gaps in knowledge. The global efforts being made to place $ values on the world's natural capital and ecosystem life support services will be summarised. A pioneering approach to due diligence of investments, planning, new concessions and oil spill risk assessments will be presented. Insights will be given on the latest techniques for mapping environmental resources and services in integrated GIS systems on the web, which will provide an “ecosystem health thermometer” making damage to ecosystem services visible to stakeholders. Operators' future “licence to operate” will depend in part on utilizing ecosystem service approaches and values to address stakeholder sustainability and values concerns

Abstract Excellent sand control success and high productivity completions have been realized with productivity completions have been realized with concentrated sand-in-oil slurries. However, modifications to the technique have broadened application of the process and obtained even better results. The gravel-carrying fluid has been changed from very viscous oils to a waterbase polymer system. A viscosity breaker has been included and this results in a controlled viscosity break back to a few centipoise within a predetermined time period. The process can be designed to cover a bottom-hole temperature range from 100 to 225 degrees F. Particular advantages to the systems are (1) it can be used in water injection and source wells with no fear of permeability damage, (2) oil wells should tend to clean up more easily because of the lower final viscosity of the carrying fluid, and (3) the new fluid is shear thinning, resulting in very little friction pressure while pumping, while providing good sand-carrying capacity at low pump rates. Numerous successful field tests have been conducted and the results are reported. Introduction Numerous new and/or modified sand control systems have been developed during recent years, attempting to solve what must be considered the major production problem associated with unconsolidated sandstones. A new water-base, viscous, nondamaging gravel pack carrying fluid has been developed that permits the placement of high sand concentrations with minimum pump pressure and rapid formation cleanup characteristics. As the system is water based, it lends itself for use in both water injection and/or source wells, as well as oil and gas wells. Numerous wells have been gravel packed using this new technique. In general, the injection wells take as much as 2.5 times more water than would have been anticipated utilizing conventional sand control methods, and the production wells produce initially "skin free" with higher production rates than demonstrated in equivalent wells completed with other sand control systems. VISCOUS WATER-PACK SYSTEM The water-pack sand control system is composed of a viscous, high sand concentration (15 lb/gal), water-base slurry that is placed behind a screen and liner. A listing and discussion of the basic components follows.

AB  - Abstract CO2 has been a significant part of the advancement and development of hydraulic fracturing. This technology was proven in the 1970s as an energy source to help recovery of well stimulation fluids and is predominantly used to stimulate tight sandstone reservoirs because it is both clean and effective. The first application of CO2 in Saudi Arabia is discussed, highlighting its success in terms of 50% increased productivity, quick cleanup, and reduced water volume. Classically, conventional hydraulic fracturing (acid or proppant) has been used to maximize long-term production and minimize near wellbore (NWB) damage. This paper discusses how CO2 fracturing can offer more advantages by reducing or eliminating the use of the underground water. It also provides a gas drive solution for effective cleanup. CO2 can be used to significantly reduce interfacial tension and resultant capillary forces, thus helping remove fracturing fluid, connate water, and emulsion blocks, which are among the primary damage mechanisms when fracturing gas wells. CO2 has been a significant part of the advancement and development of hydraulic fracturing since the 1970s, but mostly just in the US during those early days. This paper discusses in detail the first application in Saudi Arabia using CO2 to foam a proppant fracturing treatment. The implementation of this technology was successful. This was demonstrated by the resultant 50% productivity increase in the study well. Using this method allowed a very fast and effective cleanup compared to other wells fractured using conventional crosslinked fluid methods. Additionally, using this method provided the added benefit of reducing water volume, which is a critical factor in this area because of limited water availability. The first CO2 application in Saudi Arabia is discussed, highlighting its success in a resultant 50% productivity increase. The method allowed fast and effective cleanup compared to wells fractured using conventional crosslinked fluids. Additional benefits included reduced water volume, which was critical in this area because of limited resources.

AB  - AbstractExisting prediction methods are inadequate for unstable radial displacement, with prediction errors of up to 500%. This work provides a new theoretical basis for understanding unstable displacements in both Newtonian and non-Newtonian fluids, based on a detailed analysis of the fingering morphology and a new derivation using fractional flow theory for radial flow. Design guidelines are given to assist in optimizing the design of fingered acid-fracture treatments for horizontal wells in carbonate formations.Unstable radial displacement creates power-law (fractal) displacement patterns. for a wide range of mobility ratios, and the displacement efficiency can be expressed as a function of the mobility ratio M. The finger wavelength is a function of the Peclet number and the fracture aperture, and the detailed morphology can be understood in terms of the fluid rheology. The size of the fingering zone can be predicted from the mobility ratio and Peclet number. A productivity index factor PIF can be used to compare different treatment scenarios. and thus optimise the productivity of acid-fracture treatments.IntroductionEfficient stimulation processes are an important aspect of maximising well productivity and contribute to optimising the recovery efficiency from mature fields. Acid-fracturing can be a useful stimulation process for carbonate formations. and has been well-studied and successfully applied to vertical wells in carbonate formations.The technique uses: (i) limited entry through spaced perforation intervals, and (ii) viscous fingering to produce a series of etched channels in the fracture face. A high viscosity, nonreactive pre-flush is used as a fracture fluid. which is followed by the injection of a lower viscosity acid (Fig. 1). The viscosity contrast between the two fluids creates acid fingers along a linear path through the fracture fluid, etching channels along the adjacent fracture face. Upon fracture closure, the ridges between the etched channels support the channel network, allowing improved communication between the reservoir and the well.Current acid-fracturing procedure is based on Newtonian fingering relationships in linear displacement. However, fracture gels are generally highly non-Newtonian and the stimulation of horizontal wells involves radial rather than linear flow (Fig. 2). Although many papers have been written on viscous fingering in Newtonian fluids and on single-phase flow of non-Newtonian fluids, there are relatively few papers on viscous fingering in non-Newtonian fluids. Most research on viscous fingering has been concerned with displacement in linear and five-spot geometries on the basis of experiments done in linear Hele-Shaw cells and packed beds.Recent work suggests that radial flow creates power-law (fractal) relationships rather than the constant dispersivity relationships often used to describe linear flow. Furthermore. recent work has shown that the traditional Koval theory has prediction errors of up to 500% for radial displacements especially for non-Newtonian fluids. A new understanding is needed to successfully model unstable radial displacement.Displacement Theory for Radial FlowThe Buckley-Leverett approach can be applied to radial flow (Appendix A), and the relationship for frontal advance (with negligible gravity and capillary pressure influence) is identical to that for linear flow: (1)where k1 and k2 are the permeabilities to phases 1 and 2 respectively. Koval assumed that the fractional flow could be expressed by a similar equation for segregated miscible displacement. The permeabilities to phases 1 and 2 are assumed to be a linear function of the average saturation of each fluid, for miscible displacement (i.e. the straight-line relative permeability assumption): (2) (3)The fractional flow of phase 2 can then be given as:P. 811

AB  - Abstract The main objectives of this work are to prevent water blockage problem of wells drilled to tight gas reservoirs by minimizing fluid invasion and to reduce solid invasion with the optimized sodium silicate concentration in actual drill-in fluid and ultimately, improving well productivity by obtaining high return permeability after forming the very thin, impermeable and easily removable filter cake. Static filtration tests were conducted on 0.25″ tight cores at 300°F under 300 psi ΔP with 250 psi back pressure and 500 psi inlet pressure to collect filtrate volumes. Rheology tests were performed up to 140°F under atmospheric and at 300°F under 300 psi pressure. Rheology experiments were performed for base fluid and with 0.05, 0.075, 0.1 wt%, while filtrations were also performed for 0.5, 1 and 1.5 wt% sodium silicate concentrations. Initial and return permeabilities were measured by injecting 3 wt% KCl through 2″ core sample under constant flow rates after damaging it. CT numbers were obtained before and after damaging 2″ core by doing CT Scan. Filtrate volume and cake thickness reduced by 53% and 65% with 0.075 wt% (3.5 ml & 0.7 mm), respectively, compared than base fluid (7.4 ml & 2 mm). 0.075 wt% determined as an optimum concentration. Water blockage problem of tight gas wells prevented by minimizing the fluid invasion. Measured initial and return permeabilities of 2″ core remained same as 1.3 mD. This result proved that no solid invasion occurs with 0.075 wt% sodium silicate and in case of 100% filter cake removal, return permeability will be 100%. Forming filter cake with 0.7 mm thickness lets us to claim that it can be completely removed by washing with 15 wt% HCl. Obtained CT numbers confirmed return permeability measurement as well. Barite flotation recovery and solubility concentration of silica with PH are the two approaches that should be considered together to explain the mechanism of 0.075 wt% sodium silicate. Polymerization effect shows itself for ≤0.075 wt%, while amorphous silica effect occurs for >0.075 wt%. Polymerization effect became the evidence of obtaining 100% return permeability.

AB  - Abstract The electroless consolidation of formation sand with the catalytic plating of nickel from aqueous solution provides a flexible alternative to "plastic" or resin sand consolidation in certain cases. A shut-in period (required for resin curing) is not needed, stronger bonding is achieved, and the consolidation is suitable for exposure to temperatures far beyond the range of plastic sand consolidations. The character of laboratory-consolidated cores is described, with emphasis on the permeability, porosity, and compressive strength attained. A model of the influence of nickel sand consolidations on well productivity is presented to show that very little productivity is presented to show that very little impairment is to be expected. Introduction Electroless nickel plating for sand consolidation was perfected in the latter half of the 1960's. A general description of the plating process and deposit properties is available in Ref. 1. Design procedures properties is available in Ref. 1. Design procedures for consolidation, along with a description of system chemistry, is provided in Ref. 2, a companion to this paper. The process involves injecting a catalyst that paper. The process involves injecting a catalyst that activates the sand and then injecting various aqueous solutions of nickel salts containing a chemical reducing agent. The metal layer deposits spontaneously on the sand grains, binding them into a consolidated mass. Although originally developed for higher-temperature applications up to about 550 degrees, far beyond the useful range of plastic sand-consolidation treatments, electroless nickel sand consolidations are available for the full range of reservoir temperatures. Nickel-consolidated sands exhibit compressive strengths much higher than organic cementing materials, with the strength highest near the wellbore, and require no curing time. Furthermore, since consolidation permeabilities depend strongly on nickel content, the placement tends to be self-regulating. Zones of initially higher permeability tend to be brought to the same level as permeability tend to be brought to the same level as the bulk of the formation to be treated; consequently, placement becomes more uniform. placement becomes more uniform. Electroless nickel plating has successfully consolidated a wide variety of materials, ranging from 700-micron ground walnut shells, to glass beads of all sizes, through fine, high-clay-content sands, as well as the typical Gulf Coast formation sands. Job design primarily depends on the specific surface area of the material to be plated and on the plating temperature. A variety of chemical systems plating temperature. A variety of chemical systems are available, depending on the application in question. Yet, even with significant uncertainty in the design parameters, successful consolidations can be expected. parameters, successful consolidations can be expected. Presented here are the results of core flow consolidations illustrating how the nickel content, porosity, permeability, and compressive strength is porosity, permeability, and compressive strength is likely to vary according to plating conditions. A model of the plating process that assumes uniform coatings around the sand grains leads to a simple permeability-porosity relationship that is in good permeability-porosity relationship that is in good agreement with experimental measurements, at least for porosity reductions of less than 50 percent. The influence of the consolidation on well productivity is examined, assuming a linear porosity profile, to show only minor "impairment." EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURES AND RESULTS The standard test material was Clemtex No. 5 sand, a clean, rounded, 80-120 mesh sand often used in formation simulation. Although results presented here are only for this material, other materials already cited exhibit the same general behavior. Design conditions were chosen to achieve 100-cc consolidations. The design specification involves choosing flow rate and solution composition for a given sand specific surface area and plating temperature. Design details are available in Ref 2. The sand was packed into steel pipe sections, with appropriate packed into steel pipe sections, with appropriate retaining screens, flow distributors and compression springs at each end. The packed pipe sections were then connected to the flow system, preceded by a constant-rate Whitey pump and followed by a backpressure regulator and gas-liquid separator. The pipe section was set into a constant temperature bath, and injected solutions were heated to the desired bath temperature before reaching the sand. The volume of plating solution was about 75 PV.

AB  - Abstract Mitigating drilling hazards has been challenging cost-effective well construction for decades. Balancing drilling risks against the optimum well design while preparing for unplanned drilling events combine to be a never-ending set of frustrations. The operator's authorization for expenditures (AFE) can be significantly impacted when he is fighting pore pressure/formation fracture gradient challenges or unexpected shallow flows, unstable formations, overpressure formations or depleted formations are encountered. Excessive use of lost-circulation pills, and traditional contingency liners drive well costs up and jeopardizes reaching total depth (TD) with an effective completion. A drilling hazard mitigation solution could be as simple as using that contingency liner that was planned into the well, or the use of drill-in casing to fight an unstable wellbore. However, the use of conventional solid expandable drilling liners can drive excessive risks into the well and even cause a costly sidetracking of the well. Operators in the former Soviet Union (FSU) have been successfully using short expandable openhole clad-thru-clad liners for decades to cost-effectively mitigate expected, and unexpected, well construction challenges. These systems are used only when necessary and cover only the trouble zone, allowing the well construction to continue without the loss of any hole size. Operators have used these solid, expandable systems as "Steel MudcakeTM," minimizing the risk of using solid, expandable liners. This paper describes applications where this alternative solid expandable liner system has been used over the years and how a wide variety of well construction challenges have been addressed without the need for downsizing a well section. Short, low-risk, openhole, expandable liners have been used to address drilling hazards during the well construction process, allowing continued, post-remediation drilling of the well with the same size bit. Because there is no loss of hole size through the use of these openhole "clad" liners, subsequent drilling hazards in the same-size hole section can be remediated without downsizing the wellbore. Installing field-proven, short, solid, expandable, openhole clad liners minimizes operational risks and reduces the cost of these expandable systems. Minimizing the "flat" time on the drilling curve has allowed operators to continue the well construction process quicker, reducing rig time and cutting well construction costs. Discussion of how risks have been driven out of the expandable drilling hazard mitigation product and case histories will be reviewed for several applications. We will also discuss how this and other conventional and non-conventional hazard mitigation "tools" can be used separately and in conjunction with one another to significantly reduce well construction risks and reduce well costs. Introduction-Drilling Trouble Zones Many years of experience have been documented in drilling trouble zones, such as lost-circulation zones, unstable formations, and pressure transistions1, and yet an operator can spend an inordinate amount of time dealing with these zones. On average, drilling these types of trouble zones has added 10 to 20% to well construction costs.

AB  - AbstractGas condensate reservoirs usually exhibit complex flow behaviors due to thebuild-up of condensate banks around the wells when the bottomhole pressuredrops below the dew point. The liquid phase accumulation in the near-wellboreregion forms a ring that reduces the gas relative permeability. As a result,gas production decreases and the liquid phase which is a significant part ofthe value of the field remains in the reservoir.Various solutions have been implemented in order to remediate such aproductivity loss. They include drilling horizontal wells instead of verticalwells[1-3], hydraulically fracturing vertical wells before or after thedevelopment of the condensate bank, and acidizing after the condensate bank hasformed[4-14].In this work, we used reservoir simulation to quantify the increase in wellproductivity from different remediation solutions and assess theireffectiveness. The empirical correlations needed to model non-Darcy flow andcapillary number effects, which are among the main parameters that control gascondensate well performance, were calibrated with actual well testdata.As should be expected, we found that horizontal wells and hydraulicallyfractured vertical wells improve well productivity. The degree of productivityenhancement, however, depends on well and reservoir parameters such ashorizontal well lengths, permeability anisotropy, fracture length and fractureconductivity. Different simulation models were run above and below the dewpoint pressure at the same reservoir and flow conditions. The results of oursimulations show that horizontal wells enhance productivity significantly belowthe dew point. Performance improvement with hydraulic fractures, on the otherhand, depends on facture length and fracture conductivity.IntroductionWell productivity estimation in gas condensate reservoirs is still achallenge. This is due to the complex compositional changes and phase behaviorswhich occur when wells are produced below the dew point. Accurate estimates ofwell deliverability in these cases require accurate evaluations of both gas andcondensate effective permeabilities[15]. This is particularly important withinthe near-wellbore region where the effective permeability to gas and the valueof flowing bottomhole pressure of producing wells are affected by thecondensate saturation distribution.Three radial zones with different liquid saturations appear around agas-condensate well producing below the dew point[16]. Away from the well, anouter region has the initial liquid saturation; next, closer to the well, thereis a rapid increase in liquid saturation and a decrease in the gas mobility.Liquid in that region is immobile. Next to the well, an inner region is formedwhere liquid saturation is higher than critical and both oil and gas phases aremobile. Finally, in the immediate vicinity of the well, there is a region withlower liquid saturation due to capillary number effects, which represents theratio of viscous to capillary forces[17]. The existence of the fourth region isimportant because it counters the reduction in productivity caused by liquiddrop-out.The loss of productivity in gas condensate reservoirs due to condensationnear the wellbore is well documented in the literature[18-20]. It is moresignificant in low-permeability reservoirs which experience larger bottomholepressure drops, and consequently, fall below the dew point pressure faster.Several techniques have been used to decrease or delay pressure drawdowns ingas condensate wells in order to increase or maintain gas well deliverability.These include drilling horizontal wells and fracturing verticalwells.Hydraulic fracturing is the primary choice for enhancing production in amajority of gas condensate reservoirs throughout the world[4]. Theeffectiveness of hydraulic fractures depends mainly on the fracture length andon the dimensionless fracture conductivity[13]. A horizontal well can beconsidered as a limiting case of an infinite-conductivity fracture, with afracture height equal to the wellbore diameter[21].Horizontal wellsincrease reservoir contact area and decrease pressure drawdown.

AB  - AbstractUnderbalanced drilling (UBD) in becoming increasingly used as a technique to reduce significant invasive formation damage in vertical and horizontal wells to improve production rates of oil and gas, and enhance injectivity in gas and water injection situations. UBD may be a technically demanding procedure to execute in certain reservoirs and much of the benefit with respect to mitigation of formation damage may be compromised if the underbalanced drilling operation is not screened, designed and conducted in an appropriate fashion. This paper reviews common formation damage mechanisms which may occur in reservoirs and how, in certain situations, these types of damage may be reduced or eliminated through the appropriate use of underbalanced drilling technology. Various situations in which underbalanced drilling technology may result in potential significant formation damage are also discussed.IntroductionUnderbalanced drilling is utilized worldwide for the drilling of horizontally and vertically oriented wells to increase rates of penetration, reduce invasive formation damage and reduce significant problems with drilling due to lost circulation and differential sticking. Many successful implementation stories of underbalanced drilling are evident in the literature1,2, however, underbalanced drilling is not a panacea for all formation damage problems in that inappropriately designed underbalanced drilling jobs may actually result in more formation damage than if a well-designed and contemplated overbalanced job had been used in the same situation in some circumstances.This paper reviews some of the current technology in use at the present time in underbalanced drilling and illustrates some of the points which operators should be aware of before embarking on an underbalanced drilling operation.What is Underbalanced Drilling (UBD)?A rigorous definition of UBD is the situation in which the exerted circulating pressure of the drilling fluid in contact with the formation is less than the effective pore pressure in the adjacent section of the matrix. The desirable course of action is to have this occur along the entire exposed section of the net productive pay of the reservoir under consideration, resulting in a net inflow of oil, water or gas (which may be contained in the matrix) into the wellbore. These produced fluids are then returned to the surface along with the circulating drilling fluid. A number of nomenclatures for a description of UBD exist in the literature. They can be defined as follows:Overbalanced Drilling. A situation in which the equivalent circulating density of the drilling mud is sufficient that, at bottom hole conditions, the drilling fluid pressure is greater than the formation pressure, resulting in an effectively killed state of the well (where no inflow of formation of fluids occurs) during a conventional drilling operation. This was the most ommon technique utilized to drill wells in the past, and is still the dominant technology utilized in many reservoir situations today.Low Head Drilling. Low head drilling refers to a situation where an overbalanced pressure condition, similar to that described above, is maintained with the use of lower density oil-based fluids or possibly aerated or gasified fluids to reduce the effective overbalance pressure exerted on the formation.

AB  - AbstractThe paper discusses different mechanisms that may explain field observations of productivity decline. In particular, this work reviews some central issues related to rock mechanical processes that may directly or indirectly result in productivity decline and also possible remediation in sandstone reservoirs. Some emphasis is put on particle plugging of the formation itself, screens and gravel packs, scaling in the near-wellbore region, behind the screen/gravel sand production (including quantification of produced sand volume/damaged zone), filtercake mobilization, near-wellbore rock compaction and effects of water breakthrough on rock properties. All these mechanisms are directly or indirectly linked to rock mechanics aspects through local pore pressure changes and induced deformations of the formation rock. Plugging may further induce rock mechanical failure around the well. Two principles of direct sand control are discussed, i.e. borehole re-enforcement (expandable screens, gravel-packing, propped fracturing, chemical consolidation) and filtering (standalone screens, gravel-packs, frac-packs, pre-packed screens) and their impact on productivity upon reservoir depletion, scaling, sand production, filtercake mobilization and fines migration. Different analyses are used to highlight central mechanisms of productivity alteration and to define design parameters. In particular, chemo-mechanical effects upon water breakthrough are discussed with respect to permeability alteration around the wellbore and scale formation. Further, examples will be given that remedial actions to remove scale and other plugging agents in certain cases may harm the formation mechanical integrity, and result in sand production, rock compaction and productivity decline. An example of a simple laboratory test to quantify such loss of rock integrity will be given. The work demonstrates how rock mechanical analysis may guide the selection of completion method, and how proper diagnosis of well performance and formation integrity may guide the selection and design of remedial actions.IntroductionThe productivity of oil and gas wells is used as a measure of the success of the drilling and completion of the well. Productivity as defined in a classical well test, relates the produced hydrocarbon rate to the production pressure drop (drawdown). However, in economical analysis, where cash-flow is central, the production rate itself, i.e. produced hydrocarbon volume per time unit, is still the central parameter. Though, the more technical productivity measure is merely an aid to understand well behavior and the effect of various completion and stimulation measures. Moreover, from a reservoir management perspective, productivity is not restricted to well behavior alone, but it is also related to the energy in the entire reservoir (i.e. the pressure evolution and the relative movements of fluids in the reservoir).Sand production is one classical productivity restriction in economical means, as sand production has historically led to the choking back of the well and thus reduced cash flow. More recent sand management practices have, however, shown very good results in both technical and economical terms through controlled sand production to surface rather than classical ‘sand control' through total sand exclusion [1. 2. 3. ]. Recent sand management practices has thus challenged the classical sand control philosophy and led to higher industry demands in terms of cost of installation and resulting productivity.In our study, we have focused on direct and indirect rock mechanical aspects of well productivity, and we have neglected reservoir scale effects, such as compaction and water/gas coning, as well as wellbore flow effects. In doing so, we have slimmed down the analysis to processes at the wellbore wall and its immediate vicinity. This is motivated by the high impact on productivity of changes in sand face geometry and formation properties in the near-wellbore zone. Also, most man-made impacts are related to well operations in the widest sense.

AB  - AbstractAn efficient semi-analytical solution method appropriate for the approximate modeling of the performance of non-conventional wells operating under primary production is described. The approach, referred to as the s-k*method, accounts approximately for the effects of reservoir heterogeneity and for pressure losses within the wellbore. The accuracy of the method is demon-strated through comparison to detailed finite difference results. Extensive calculations for the performance of non-conventional wells in multiple realizations of log-normally distributed permeability fields are then presented. The effect of wellbore hydraulics on well performance is assessed for several different well geometries and for varying degrees of reservoir heterogeneity. Comparisons between ensemble-averaged quantities (i.e., results averaged over many realizations) and results for a single "average" (homogeneous) reservoir representation are also made. As expected, these calculations differ in general, though for some quantities (e.g., productivity ratio) the homogeneous results give very accurate estimates. The overall approach provides an efficient means for estimating the combined effects of reservoir heterogeneity and wellbore pressure losses on the productivity of non-conventional wells.IntroductionThe productivity of horizontal, multilateral or other non-conventional wells can be significantly impacted by both reservoir heterogeneity and by pressure losses within the wellbore. Tools capable of modeling these effects are therefore required in order to optimize the design of non-conventional wells. General finite difference reservoir simulators can be used to account for heterogeneity and wellbore flow effects, provided an accurate model for wellbore hydraulics is available within the simulator. The use of conventional reservoir simulators to model the effects of fine scale heterogeneities can be cumbersome, however, because the models can be time consuming to build and may require substantial computation time to run. This is an even more significant issue when many scenarios or geological realizations are to be simulated.When applicable, alternative procedures, based on semi-analytical solution methods, are simpler and more efficient than finite difference methods. These semi-analytical methods therefore offer significant advantages over general finite difference techniques in some cases. In previous work, we presented a semi-analytical solution technique based on Green's functions for the estimation of the performance of non-conventional wells in heterogeneous reservoirs.1 We refer to the approach as the s-k*method, since heterogeneity is represented in terms of a near-well skin s and a background effective permeability k*. The method extends previous approaches in that it accounts approximately for reservoir heterogeneity and pressure losses in the wellbore due to frictional and accelerational effects. Like other semi-analytical approaches, the s-k*method is applicable in a limited set of cases; e.g., for single phase flow.

AB  - AbstractFluid clean-up effects have hampered stimulation success in many tight,naturally fractured sandstone reservoirs. The petrophysical responses oftreatment fluid invasion can affect short-term and in some cases long-termreservoir deliverability. Many times reservoirs such as the Wolfcamp intervals,in the Val Verde Basin of west Texas, exhibit better response to CO energizedfluids than non-energized fluids. We will present data from a case study ofseveral wells in the Wolfcamp A, C, and D intervals where CO-assisted fluid and100% CO treatments have significantly improved productivity in both initial andremedial applications.First, we will include case histories where CO-assisted fluid fracturing andrefracturing treatments improved performance over non-energized, fluidtreatments, Next, we will describe cases where injections of non-energizedfluids systematically reduced production; in particular we will describe a casethat was successfully remediated by a 100% CO treatment. Then, several caseswill be presented showing sustainable improved responses following 100% COtreatments in previously energized and non-energized fracture stimulatedintervals.P. 255

AB  - Abstract Propellants have been used in the oil and gas industry for a wide variety of applications including well cleanup, damaged zone treatment, and stimulation. In particular, propellants have a unique place in the industry as a stimulation / enhancement tool that can significantly improve productivity and lower operator costs. However, the success of a propellant-stimulation job depends not just on the operational design/deployment, but also the pre-job evaluation using predictive modelling tools. This paper focuses on providing insight into the processes involved in propellant-based stimulation, successful case histories (propellants used as standalone tools and combined with the perforating process), and the modeling tools that are used to design and optimize propellant jobs. Case histories showing the benefits of using these tools to lower workover costs and restore productivity for injection and production will be presented. When used as a pre-frac perforating tool, propellants can reduce horsepower requirements by up to 35% in some cases. Along with the propellant tools, a dynamic perforation modeling tool successfully models the event beforehand to mitigate risk and predict the viability of the process. The software simulates the dynamic response of a cased or uncased wellbore, its contents and the porous rock formation, to the energy released by gas-generating and stored pressure sources. In particular, the modeling tool can be applied to predict fracture propagation, near-wellbore cleanup and skin reduction during wireline and TCP operations. The results from the case histories and the insight provided by the dynamic modeling software illustrate that, when properly applied, propellant tools can add tremendous value to completion operations by lowering costs and enhancing production. This paper also provides the framework for a completion engineer to better understand the design and optimization of a propellant-stimulation job.

AB  - Abstract With the desired objective of increasing Oil production, the Operator initiated a high inclination well drilling campaign utilizing open hole completions with Inflow Control Device (ICD) screens in Burgan (sandstone) reservoirs. The approach dramatically reduces the effect of water and gas breakthrough, while optimizing production rates throughout the completion interval. Challenges encountered while drilling these high inclination wells included increased non-productive time resulting from interbedded formations with varying formation pressures, wellbore instability in the reactive, stressed shale sections and hole cleaning challenges. A non-aqueous reservoir drilling fluid (RDIF) system was customized with extensive laboratory testing to overcome the challenges and protect the reservoir from drilling fluid damage. The formation damage phenomena investigated included foreign particle invasion, formation clay swelling, chemical incompatibility, oil wetting of the reservoir rock, emulsion blocking and fluid invasion (water blocking). Based on the reservoir rock morphology and the calculated pore throat size distribution, the bridging particles type, size distribution, and concentration to be selected to rapidly establish a tight thin filter cake and prevent the invasion of filtrate and fine drilled solids deep into the formation to minimize damage to reservoir and avoid getting differential stuck pipe incident. Removal of skin damage resulting from external and internal filter cake deposition while drilling reservoir with invert emulsion fluid is vitally important to enhance production. The customized near-wellbore damage remediation system constructed around an in-situ acid precursor was designed to improve hydrocarbon recovery. This paper also summarizes engineering best practices developed while drilling, tripping and performing PST to achieve the operators well objectives. The lessons learned during these applications were incorporated into future wells to standardize operating procedures and improve field performance.

AB  - Abstract Saudi Aramco has significantly increased the number of horizontal gas producers over the past five years in an attempt to maximize well productivity through maximum reservoir contact while reducing the need for hydraulic fracturing stimulation, commonly required in most vertical producers. Although the majority of horizontal producers have met expectations, a good number of them have underperformed showing lower initial gas rates and higher decline rates than anticipated. The unexpected poor performance in most wells has been attributed to induced formation damage during drilling operations, the highly heterogeneous nature of the reservoir resulting in low porosity and permeability in different areas of the field, destabilization and precipitation of mineral and organic scales in the tubulars and formation, and condensate banking effects. The overwhelming majority of horizontal producers are completed open-hole, which significantly limits stimulation options once the wells have been completed and put in production. Moreover, high pressure and temperature conditions make accessibility of the horizontal section very difficult, and the chance for achieving successful stimulation of the entire horizontal section relatively low.  Conventional stimulation treatments involving coiled tubing (CT) acid washes and bullheaded hydraulic fracture treatments have been attempted over the years but results have been mostly unsuccessful or relatively modest. This paper details a case history of a new approach combining different techniques, which was successfully used to stimulate a long open-hole horizontal section in an underperforming gas producer. A hydraulic fracture treatment using hydrajetting technology, that provided the ability to achieve deep penetration into the targeted zone, resulting in effective treatment fluids diversion, was successfully pumped.  A detailed analysis to ascertain the effectiveness of the procedure was conducted, the results of which are discussed in this paper. Introduction Gas producer A1 is located in a partially depleted sector of the field where reservoir characteristics are those of a tight formation. The well's reservoir pressure averages 5,000 psig.  at 10,000 ft TVDSS, and it has a kh of 0.4 md-ft, which partially explains the reason the well produced at a low average pre-stimulation rate of 2 MMSCFD with a flowing wellhead pressure (FWHP) of 1,200 psig.  Moreover, the well is flowing at below dew-point pressure, thus condensate banking and mineral and organic scale deposition effects were additional contributors to the well's poor performance. In fact, condensate banking and scale deposition are challenges currently facing a number of gas producers that have been on-stream for a number of years, and Saudi Aramco has a number of ongoing research projects and scheduled field trials aimed at addressing and solving these problems.

AB  - Abstract Reducing the invasion of drilling, completion and workover fluids to as low a level as possible will alleviate many problems of mechanically unstable formations, differential sticking and lost circulation. A properly formulated ultra-low invasion fluid (ULIF) will also reduce formation damage and thereby often increase well productivity. In addition, certain classes of ULIF will provide wellbore strengthening. This paper describes the technology used to produce a class of ULIF and will review the benefits that limiting fluid and pressure invasion of fluid brings to rock integrity, drilling performance and well productivity. The ULIF additives described are biodegradable, environmentally acceptable and can be used in water based, oil based and synthetic based fluids. They are easy to add to any mud system and the ultra-low invasion properties of the fluids are measured and maintained in the field by using a simple sand bed invasion test. The paper focuses mainly on case histories from several regions of the world where ULIFs have been used. In North, Central and South America alone, over 120 wells have used the ULIF additives in the past 3 years. The products have also been used in India, the Middle East, Europe, Africa and the Far East. Log data are presented that clearly demonstrate the ability of a ULIF to reduce wellbore instability and fluid invasion. Evidence of wellbore strengthening is also presented along with several cases where well productivity has been increased. In addition to showing the enhanced technical performance obtained with ULIFs, we also demonstrate the economic benefits of using these fluids. The same technology used to formulate Ultra-low Invasion Drilling Fluids can also be used very successfully - sometimes with modification - in completion fluids, workover fluids and cementing operations to reduce or eliminate the same problems. Introduction The ability to reduce the invasion of drilling, completion and workover fluids to the lowest possible level brings many benefits, including less formation damage, fewer differential sticking events and the prevention of some types of mechanical wellbore instability. Also, if transmission of the mud overbalance pressure to the pore pressure is prevented or greatly reduced, the effective stress is not reduced and compressional failure of the rock may be avoided.  If rock can be strengthened (or, more accurately, if the fracture gradient can be increased) by some mechanism, higher fluid densities can be used without resulting in induced losses. The obvious rewards from being able to reduce invasion to the lowest possible level mean that a considerable amount of effort is being expended in seeking "zero fluid loss fluids?? as well as fluids that strengthen the wellbore by stopping pressure invasion, consolidating rock or modifying the stress distribution. In this paper we review a class of additives that is designed to limit both fluid and pressure invasion. These Ultra-low Invasion Fluid (ULIF) additives can be used in drilling, completion or workover fluids and they also form the basis of a class of cementing spacers. The additives are equally effective in water based, oil based and synthetic based fluids. Laboratory tests show that, after a brief period of invasion, the ULIF products form an extremely low permeability seal that virtually eliminates further fluid ingress: once this happens, the formation is effectively protected from the consequences of further pressure or fluid invasion. An important feature is that this seal is formed extremely rapidly - in a matter of seconds after the rock has been exposed to the fluid. This rapid shutoff of invasion, depicted in Figure 1, is a key factor in achieving the excellent results seen in the field with the ULIF products. In this paper we briefly discuss the technology behind this class of Ultra-low Invasion Fluids. We then describe several field examples where the muds have successfully reduced wellbore instability and reduced or eliminated induced losses. We will also provide examples of much reduced fluid invasion into permeable sands: in the reservoir, this can help limit formation damage and hence improve well productivity1,2.

AB  - AbstractA case study has been conducted on Red Fork formation wells with bottomhole temperatures ranging from 225-250 F. The fracturing applications and techniques in this area had historically provided lower than expected post-treatment productivity and a rapid decline rate, suggesting that the fracture conductivity were less than optimum. Joint efforts of the operator and service company, utilizing state-of-the-art fluids, breakers, and design methodologies, were employed to optimize well productivity. The case histories of hydraulic fracturing treatments and subsequent production performance of five offset wells are analyzed and presented. Average incremental production rates were significantly improved through application of the new technologies, clearly demonstrating the effectiveness of the modifications.IntroductionThe study was conducted on Red Fork formation wells in the Strong City Field. The field is located in Roger Mills County, Oklahoma, approximately 20 miles north of Elk City. The wells, which are located in two adjacent sections, were drilled either as replacement wells or as increased density wells. The Red Fork formation has been described as a Pennsylvanian Age sequence of sands and shales with a gross thickness of 700-800 ft.A representative type log for the Red Fork is shown in Figure 1. The interval depths were 12,500 ft to 13,200 ft in the study area. The sandstone formation contains small amounts of clay minerals such as chlorite, illite, kaolinite, and mixed layer. The study wells had permeabilities ranging from 0.01 to 0.19 millidarcies and porosities from 8 to 10%. Reservoir pressures ranged from 4,670 to 9,478 psi. The wide range of pressures was due to the effects of offset drainage on these increased density wells. The bottomhole static temperature of the production zones ranged from 225 to 250 F.Hydraulic fracturing operations have been applied in the area as a means to stimulate the wells for many years with varying degrees of success. Fracturing fluid load recovery from these treatments was typically less than 25%. Foams generated with carbon dioxide were used in an effort to address the low fluid recoveries which were believed to be associated with water retention in the reservoir. Even with the energized, low pH fluids the recovery was still typically under 25%, suggesting that fracture conductivity was less than optimum. Premature screenouts were common when aggressive proppant schedules were attempted. Additional expenses were commonly incurred as a result of proppant flowback associated with extended shut-in times after stimulation.P. 27

AB  - Krueger, R.F., KGK Petroleum Consultants SPE Member AbstractAlmost every field operation is a potential source of damage to well productivity. This paper provides a broad overview of the nature of formation damage problems, how they occur during various oilfield operations, and their effects on well productivity. Diagnosis of numerous formation damage problems has led to the conclusion that formation damage is usually associated with either the movement and bridging of fine solids or chemical reactions and thermodynamic considerations. The fine solids may be introduced from wellbore fluids or generated in situ by the interaction of invading fluids with rock minerals or formation fluids. Control of formation damage requires proper design of treating fluids for chemical compatibility and strict quality control of fluid physical and chemical properties during treatment. The use of treating fluid filtration, clean work strings (pipe), and inhibited fluids has been shown to be important in the control of formation damage during well treatment. IntroductionLaboratory and field studies indicate that almost every operation in the field - drilling, completion, workover, production, and stimulation - is a potential source of damage to well productivity. During the many years when the cost of oil was extremely low, however, productivity damage was largely ignored arid emphasis was placed on minimizing costs rather than maximizing productivity. Since the advent of the energy crisis and the Arab embargo, prevention of formation damage and maximization of well productivity has taken on added importance, not only for conventional well operations but also for taking advantage of EOR. In EOR, if the conductivity of injection and producing wells is damaged, sweep efficiencies and recovery factors will be adversely affected. The success or failure of an EOR project may depend on the ability to produce oil at adequate rates. Because repair of formation damage is usually difficult and costly, the basic approach should be to prevent damage. To achieve this goal, the entire process of drilling, completion, and production needs to be viewed as a whole, including extensive pre-planning, execution, and follow-up. Failure to control treatment or operating procedures and chemicals properly at any stage may negate the effectiveness of all other well-designed and executed operations. Severely damaged productivity may result from a single misstep in the path of well development. A broad knowledge of how formation damage occurs is the first step in prevention of well damage. Each operation must then be studied in detail. This paper takes the first step by reviewing how formation damage occurs and showing how it affects well productivity in various operations. RELATIVE IMPORTANCE OF FORMATION DAMAGE First, let us look briefly at the relative importance of the formation condition near the wellbore. Although the drainage radius may be several hundreds of feet, the effective permeability close to the wellbore has a disproportionate effect on well productivity. This problem is illustrated in Fig. I for a well located in an inner concentric zone of different permeability from the surrounding formation. In this illustration, the normalized well productivity is plotted vs. the normalized permeability in a radial system. The normalized values represent the value of the variable in the inner concentric zone divided by the value of the same variable in the main surrounding formation. P. 535^

AB  - Abstract High pH borate gels have been used in fracturing deep gas reservoirs in Saudi Arabia. Guar and hydroxypropyl guar are used at various concentrations up to 45 lb/1000 gals. A breaker (regular or encapsulated oxidizers, guar-specific enzyme, or combinations of these breakers) is usually used to degrade the gel after the fracturing treatment. Field results indicated that the cleaning time following fracturing treatments was too long. Unbroken gel was noted in the flow back samples of some wells. This study was conducted to assess the effectiveness of various breakers that are used in the field, and determine other parameters that may affect the time needed to clean-up fractured wells. This paper presents the results of a detailed study done to evaluate the performance of several breakers at typical field conditions. The apparent viscosity of various borate gels was measured as a function of breaker type and concentration. Gel degradation was followed in a high temperature/high pressure see-through cell. The surface tension of various gel filtrates was measured as a function of temperature up to 150°C. Viscosity measurements indicated that all oxidizers degraded high pH borate gels, however the time needed to degrade the gel was found to be a function of breaker type and concentration; temperature and polymer loading. All guar-based gels produced a residue after reacting with the breaker. This residue was noted irrespective of the type and concentration of the breaker used. The residue was noted with gels formed using either guar gum or hydroxylproply guar. This residue may adversely affect the conductivity of the fracture. Surface tension measurements indicated for the first time that the surface tension of borate gels is high, which will enhance water blockage and hence reduce gas production. This paper examines factors affecting gel degradation, surface tension of borate gel filtrate, and their impact on well productivity. Introduction Hydraulic fracturing is often necessary for oil and gas wells to enhance well productivity. The fracturing fluid is one of the most important components in hydraulic fracturing treatments.1 The fluid is used to create fracture and transport proppant down the created fracture. To make the fracturing operation successful, the fracturing fluids need to possess certain properties such as sufficiently viscous to suspend and transport proppants, suitable at pumping temperature, having low friction pressure, having moderate efficiency, resistant to shear degradation, can be removed efficiently from the fracture, and economically realistic.1 Guar and guar derivatives; HPG (hydroxypropyl guar), and CMHPG (carboxymethyhydroxypropyl guar), are the most commonly used polymers to prepare water-based fracturing fluid.2 High viscosity is generated by crosslinking polymer molecules with a crosslinker (B(III), Ti(IV), or Zr(IV)).1 Borate gels have been used in the oil industry as fracture fluids and zone isolation.3 This study, however, will focus on guar gum and HPG polymers cross-linked with monoborate ions. Pre-Khuff sandstone reservoirs in Saudi Arabia produce sweet gas for more than ten years. Many of wells drilled in these reservoirs are hydraulically fractured.4 Guar gum and HPG are used to prepare the gels used in hydraulic fracture treatment. Both polymers are cross-linked with monoborate ions. The source of this ion is either boric acid or borax or organoborate salts.  The sandstone reservoirs are clean sand with illite as the main clay present in the formation. Potassium chloride is used all drilling and completion fluids to avoid fines migration problems. The reservoir temperature and pressure are 300°F and 8,535 psi, respectively. Analysis of well flow back samples following fracture treatments highlighted the presence of very viscous fluids and gel fragments. Also, the time needed to clean the fractured wells was too long. These trends indicated the gels used in these treatment did not break completely. They also indicate that the surface tension of gel filtrate was high, which resulted long cleaning time. The detrimental effects of fracture conductivity reduction resulting from incomplete fracturing fluid flowback/cleanup are well documented in literature.5 Until recently, characterization of fracturing fluid cleanup could only be simulated in the laboratory and can't be monitored in the field.6

AB  - Abstract The present study provides a comprehensive set of new analytical expressions to help understand and quantify well interference due to competition for flow space between the hydraulic fractures of parent and child wells. Determination of the optimum fracture spacing is a key factor to improve the economic performance of unconventional oil and gas resources developed with multi-well pads. Analytical and numerical model results are combined in our study to identify, analyze, and visualize the streamline patterns near hydraulic fractures, using physical parameters that control the flow process, such as matrix permeability, hydraulic fracture dimensions and assuming infinite fracture conductivity. The algorithms provided can quantify the effect of changes in fracture spacing on the production performance of both parent and child wells. All results are based on benchmarked analytical methods which allow for fast computation, making use of Excel-based spreadsheets and Matlab-coded scripts. Such practical tools can support petroleum engineers in the planning of field development operations. The theory is presented with examples of its practical application using field data from parent and child wells in the Eagle Ford shale (Brazos County, East Texas). Based on our improved understanding of the mechanism and intensity of production interference, the fracture spacing (this study) and inter-well spacing (companion study) of multi-fractured horizontal laterals can be optimized to effectively stimulate the reservoir volume to increase the overall recovery factor and improve the economic performance of unconventional oil and gas properties.

AB  - AbstractThe depletion of gas condensate reservoirs to pressures below the dew point has been studied by reservoir engineers for many years. Pressure decline below the dew point pressure causes condensation to occur which creates a hydrocarbon liquid saturation in the reservoir. This process reduces liquid recovery and may reduce gas productivity and gas recovery. Exxon experience, particularly in low-productivity, high-yield gas condensate fields, suggests that liquid condensate formation can result in severe loss of well deliverability and therefore of gas recovery. This study was undertaken to evaluate the historical frequency and severity of productivity impairment due to near-wellbore condensate buildup and to identify reservoir parameters associated with severe productivity and recovery reduction.This study of gas condensate reservoirs included a survey of Exxon and published industry experience, a review of published laboratory data, and simulations with single well flow models. Data from 17 fields are included in this paper to demonstrate that severe loss of gas recovery occurs primarily in low productivity reservoirs. Production data from two wells were history matched with simple radial models to evaluate the potential range of the critical condensate saturation (the minimum mobile condensate saturation) and its impact on gas recovery. Published laboratory data for gas-condensate relative permeability were used as a starting point for these simulations.The primary conclusion from this study is that productivity impairment results in reductions in gas recovery for wells with a permeability-thickness below 1000 md-ft. The history matched simulations support a range of critical condensate saturations from 10% to 30%, in good agreement with published laboratory values.IntroductionThe depletion of rich, gas condensate reservoirs to pressures significantly below the dew point is a topic of increasing interest as deeper, hotter hydrocarbon reservoirs are exploited. The cost and risk to develop reservoirs under these extreme conditions highlights the need to be able to confidently predict the recovery of gas and liquids from these reservoirs. In particular, there is a need to better understand the factors controlling the decline of well productivity due to hydrocarbon liquid saturation developing in the near-wellbore region of the reservoir as the flowing pressure declines below the dew point pressure.Reservoir engineers have been concerned about the impact of condensate blocking on productivity for many years. Several examples of severe productivity decline are available in the literature. At Exxon, several fields have been identified in which productivity loss below the dew point has significantly reduced gas recovery by pressure depletion.One example of poor performance is shown in figure 1. This is a moderately rich gas condensate field with an initial condensate-gas ratio of 73 bbl/Mscf. The well produced at initial rates over 1 Mscfd. When the flowing bottom-hole pressure reached the dew point, gas production declined rapidly and the well died. Pressure surveys indicated that the well was full of liquid hydrocarbons. Attempts to swab the well were unsuccessful, even though data from surrounding wells indicated the average reservoir pressure was still over 2000 psi above the dew point pressure. The well appears to have 'locked up' and ceased production shortly alter the flowing bottom-hole pressure passed below the dew point pressure. Eventually the well was successfully fracture stimulated, returning the well to initial production rates.P. 677

AB  - Abstract During the last decade, inflow control device (ICD) technology has rapidly developed and widely been used in horizontal wells due to its effectiveness in flux equalization and mitigation of unwanted fluid breakthrough. An ICD completion achieves flux equalization and manages water breakthrough by introducing an extra pressure drop in the ICD and redistributing the drawdown across the sandface between high and low permeable intervals of a horizontal well. This additional pressure loss in the ICD completion will cause reduction of effective productivity of the well, in other words it will require lower flowing bottom-hole pressure for a well with ICD completion to produce the same liquid rate compared to a well with a barefoot completion. The higher the pressure drop across the ICD completion, the better will be the equalization effect and water mitigation. Subsequently, the reservoir pressure has to be used wisely during field development as expensive pressure maintenance programs are utilized in many fields as part of the field development plans. This study tries to answer an important question: What should the optimum pressure regulation in an ICD completion be to realize the benefits of ICD without excessive reduction of well productivity? The effect of ICD regulation on flux equalization and well productivity reduction for various cases of well productivity index (PI) and permeability variation were studied through numerous static near wellbore simulation runs. Dynamic reservoir simulation was conducted to verify the results from the static simulation and dependence of the degree of flux equalization along the horizontal section on water breakthrough deferment and the oil recovery factor. An ICD design workflow is presented, which can be used to select an optimum ICD design, which maximizes the benefits of ICD with the least reduction in well productivity. A trade-off chart between well productivity and the degree of influx equalization has been built, which helps to determine the optimum pressure drop across an ICD completion in the presence of various levels of permeability variation along the wellbore. This approach can provide quick and simple calculation for the required ICD strength or number of ICD joints along the wellbore to maximize recovery of hydrocarbons. A real field case is used to illustrate the effectiveness of this workflow for optimum ICD design.

AB  - AbstractThis paper describes the introduction of a new perforating system in Norway, including its development based on operator specifications. Field examples demonstrate the measurable success of the system, showing a three- to sixfold increase in productivity and production rates as high as 8500 m3/D per well.The Visund field is located in the North Sea, about 150 km off the coast of mid-Norway. High reservoir pressure and insufficient formation strength made it necessary to perforate in relatively heavy completion fluid with the guns oriented for sand prevention. The first wells, perforated in water-based fluid with zinc charges, produced below expectations. Potential causes were identified as insufficient depth of penetration, high overbalance when perforating, and zinc precipitation damaging the formation. There were also indications from other fields that the orienting technology in use was not producing expected results.The operator started an initiative to improve the perforating system. Design criteria included deep-penetrating, low-debris steel charges that minimize debris and improve performance, increased gun-void volume for a better surge effect, accurate orientation of the perforation tunnel regardless of dogleg severity, and confirmation of the orientation. The operator and the service company collaborated to develop a system that would provide a better solution. The system was tested and qualified before it was introduced in the Visund field. To optimize perforation cleanup during static overbalanced well conditions, a dynamic underbalance method was selected.Since December 2001, six wells have been completed on Visund using the new system. In one well the dynamic underbalance response was confirmed from downhole pressure gauges run directly above the guns. The combined benefits of the perforating system, the dynamic underbalance, and a special kill pill have resulted in up to sixfold increase in productivity. The gun orientation is verifiably within requirements, and perforating debris have been minimal.IntroductionThe Visund field is a subsea development (Fig. 1) about 150 km off the coast of mid-Norway. It was put on production in April 1999 by Norsk Hydro ASA. On the 1st January 2003 the field was taken over by Statoil ASA as part of an agreement. Visund has proven to be a highly complicated reservoir to exploit, with a complex geology containing many surprises. The heterogeneous fault-segmented reservoir consists of Jurassic fluvial and deltaic sands with the main pay zone permeabilities ranging from 300 to 3,000 md. The wells, as are an increasing number of wells in the North Sea, were drilled and completed with long horizontal sections to reach several targets with one well. A typical well path is shown in Fig. 2, which illustrates the complex sinusoidal well paths required. The relatively high reservoir pressure and temperature of 440 bar and 115°C at mean sea level (MSL) of 2950 m true vertical depth further increased the drilling complexity.The Visund wells are completed using a 7-in. monobore completion in a 10 3/4-in. casing (Fig. 3). The unconfined compressive strength of the weak formations varies between 5 and 20 MPa and requires some method of sand exclusion. Because the lower range formation strength is 5 MPa, oriented perforating in the direction of the maximum stress can be used as a sand prevention technique for these wells.1-3 The alternative would be to complete the wells with screens for sand control. The drilling time of these complex horizontal wells is relatively long, which results in a long exposure of high overbalanced drilling fluids to the formation, which in turn produces a deep mud filtrate invasion zone around the wellbore. Therefore screens sometimes result in poor productivity. Perforated cemented liner can be used with deep-penetrating charges to bypass this damaged zone and provide communication with the virgin formation rock.

AB  - Abstract High-speed wired drill strings enable two way wireline communications between drilling and evaluation service provider's bottom-hole-assemblies (BHA) and surface systems. Compared to even the most advanced mud pulse telemetry, this new capability allows reliable communication with Rotary Steerable Systems (RSS), Measurement While Drilling (MWD) systems and Logging While Drilling (LWD) systems at data rates tens of thousands of times faster than ever before. This paper describes the system development and discusses in detail the advantages immediately attainable when complete, memory quality, drilling and evaluation data is provided instantaneously at surface while drilling. These advantages include: increased safety by continuous downhole pressure, drill string dynamics and high rate drill string energy transmission data monitoring regardless of flow or rig state; increased efficiency by optimizing RSS and bit performance, reducing hidden NPT, and monitoring wellbore conditions while drilling; increase reliability by providing a redundant telemetry system and enabling the user to identify damaging drill string dynamics; maximized productivity from more accurate wellbore placement. The paper will then further discuss how application of the system may further develop to maximize the value in accessing memory quality LWD data instantaneously via the wired pipe network while drilling. Introduction In 1964, a mud valve was suggested to transmit data up the mud column 1. In the 1970's, transmission of data from tools contained within the bottom hole assembly (BHA) to surface was achieved. This system, called mud pulse telemetry (MPT), utilised pressure pulses created in the downhole tools transmitted, through the continuous column of the drilling fluid, to surface where they were detected using a pressure transducer and decoded. This system was commercially introduced by Teleco Oilfield Services Incorporated in 1978 2. It revolutionized the directional drilling industry by providing the directional driller with real-time information for determination of the wellbore's geometric position and steering system performance. This resulted in significant gains in directional drilling efficiency and accuracy while simultaneously reducing risk. Companies soon recognized the value of mud pulse telemetry and developed formation evaluation devices within the BHA. Transmission of this data to surface in real-time allowed the wells trajectory to be referenced to geological features. Initially, natural gamma-ray and basic resistivity devices were introduced and this soon expanded to an ever increasing range of sophisticated devices. These provide devices a wide range data sets, equivalent to wireline in quality, but acquired in realtime very soon after the formation was drilled. To utilize the value of these measurements by influencing decisions in realtime, a dramatic increase in data transmission rates from downhole to surface was required. MPT technology continuously improved to allow (using the most advanced techniques) transmission rates of up to ~20 bits per second (bps) in practice. This however still fell short of the transmission rates required to maximize real-time use of the latest LWD systems. Based on a general principle suggested for sectioned tubulars in 1945 3, the IntelliServ® Network delivers an improvement in telemetry rates several orders of magnitude greater than the very fastest MPT systems.

AB  - Abstract Located in Eastern Venezuela the Santa Ana Field is part of the most important gas province of Venezuela: Anaco District. Its main productive zones are the Merecure and San Juan formations, which are sandstones characterized by their high permeabilities (100 - 500 md) and low pressures (1200 - 2200 psi). The wells in Anaco District are normally perforated using conventional static underbalanced techniques. The productivity of these wells was evaluated using nodal analysis techniques coupled with perforating performance simulations. The quality and amount of data was recognized to be limited. However, a qualitative diagnosis of these results indicated that the static underbalanced condition and the shaped charges used were not enough to effectively clean the perforation tunnel and surpass the near wellbore damaged zone. Dynamic underbalanced perforating coupled with high performance charges was selected as the technology that would improve productivity in the challenging wells of Santa Ana. This technology has been applied in similar scenarios across the industry in recent years, although no documentation was found on its use in such low pressure environments. This paper describes how dynamic underbalanced perforating was deployed successfully, while pushing the limits of its application envelope. To obtain a dynamic underbalanced condition in such a low pressure environment, the shot density had to be reduced to 2.5 spf, raising concerns about its effect on well productivity. Two wells were selected for this field trial. They were perforated using a TCP/DST string, which allowed the well to be tested immediately after perforating. Details of the diagnosis, planning, execution and evaluation phases of this project are described. The resulting gas production and zero perforation skin represented more than a two-fold productivity increase compared with the target reservoir average well production. These results demonstrate the effectiveness of the technique under borderline conditions, and promote its application in similar scenarios worldwide. This project shows the importance of production and perforating diagnosis, leveraging technology application and pushing the limit of dynamic underbalanced perforating in order to increase productivity in mature/low pressure assets. Introduction Perforating can be defined as the process of connecting the well with the reservoir by creating a tunnel which goes through the casing, cement sheath and the reservoir rock. The main objective of perforating is to create a clean tunnel sufficiently long that it reaches the undamaged reservoir. This process is fundamental to the productivity of the well; however, its importance is often overlooked during completion operations. It was recognized that perforating was an area that could be improved in Anaco District well completions. As a result, a qualitative evaluation of conventional perforating performance was done. This evaluation confirmed the link between poor well productivity and perforating and justified the field trials of new technology in this area. Most of the perforating technology developments have been focused on obtaining deeper penetrations. However, few breakthrough advances have been achieved relating to tunnel quality. The industry has relied solely on static underbalance, which is now a well recognized technique for perforation cleanup. The appropriate level of static underbalance has been extensively researched1,2,3; however, more recent investigations4,5 have presented relevant evidence indicating that static underbalance is not the only governing factor in effective perforation cleanup.

AB  - Abstract Many engineers today do not have the training needed to fully understand the importance of fracture mechanics principles and are easily overwhelmed in trying to deal with proper proppant and fluid selections, perforation design and strategy, and on-site quality control of the fracturing process.  The unfortunate reality is that many fracture designs are improperly engineered with critical reservoir and hydraulic fracture parameters either ignored or improperly addressed.  Many completions are either marginally economical or produce at reduced commercial rates.  Regardless of reservoir type, it is critically important to achieve a highly conductive hydraulic fracture that provides connectivity between the reservoir and the wellbore. Since its inception, fracturing and completion knowledge has expanded exponentially allowing the oil and gas industry to develop ultra-low permeability unconventional reservoirs.  During the 1980's and 1990's technology pioneers such as Holditch, Nolte, Warpinski, Veatch, and others, further developed the principles of fracturing which recognize the importance of critical fracture parameters and their effect upon initial productivity and ultimate recovery.  These gains in expertise have resulted in unprecedented activity in the Bakken, Eagle Ford, Barnett, Haynesville, and Marcellus with increasing activity in new reservoirs such as the Utica, Niobrara, and Mississippian.  Although each of these reservoirs is unconventional, each is uniquely different with respect to lithology, permeability, and hydrocarbon chemistry and interaction. This paper will challenge the industry notion that infinitely conductive fractures are being placed in many unconventional completions.  It further addresses the critical fracturing parameters required to achieve a high conductivity fracture, why they are important, and how to achieve proper proppant and fluid treatment designs.  The importance of these fundamental principles is documented and illustrated by several case histories which demonstrate the value of achieving high conductivity fractures and the effects of improper design.  This paper should be of great value to completion and operations engineers to help further their knowledge with regard to the importance of fracture conductivity and connectivity in all hydraulic fracturing applications.

AB  - AbstractThis paper examines the role of drill solids in causing formation and completion damage in horizontal openhole completions. Drill solids are routinely kept to a minimum in drilling fluids, mainly to improve drilling properties. However, these drill solids, even at low concentrations, represent a significant source of insoluble particulates that become incorporated in the drill-in fluid filtercake. Not only is the potential for formation damage greater, but these filtercakes laden with insoluble drill solids can be deposited on screens resulting in reduced productivity through screen plugging.The objective of this paper is to illustrate the effect of drill solids contained in drill-in fluids on formation damage and well screen plugging and to emphasize the importance of minimizing solids, not only to maintain the desired drill fluid rheology, but also to effect better filtercake cleanup. New laboratory test methods have been used to study formation damage in a 2-foot long horizontal wellbore model incorporating dynamic filtercake deposition on natural and synthetic core material. The model measures formation damage in radial flow. Formation damage tests with drill solids were performed for both water based and synthetic based drill-in fluids. Testing was also performed to simulate prepacked screen damage using a variety of commercially available drill-in fluids and common resin-coated gravel sizes. Results of these tests with laboratory-prepared fluids have been compared against the performance of field fluids and will eventually be correlated with field well performance.BackgroundThe use of horizontal wells to maximize recovery of oil and gas has become commonplace. However, operators frequently find horizontal wells do not provide the expected productivity after completion. While cased hole completions exploit perforation techniques to bypass the zone of formation damage caused by drilling, the openhole completions commonly used in horizontal wells do not provide a means of bypassing this damage.Previous work has discussed formation damage caused by drill-in fluids. Often, these studies have concluded that formation damage is caused by solids invasion into the rock or from damage caused by incompatible fluid filtrate. Some investigators have presented evidence that DIF filtercakes did not penetrate into rock matrices. Fraser's study showed ESEM photo images of different types of DIF filtercakes tightly compacted onto formation rock surfaces. He found very little filtercake invasion in the rock matrix. Burnham and Browne have discussed the concept of "lift off" pressure that can be used characterize the behavior of DIF filtercake on formation rock. Their studies suggest that "formation damage" can be caused by too "tight" a filtercake on rock surface.P. 749
