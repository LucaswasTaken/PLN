AB  - Abstract In an oil field, drilling engineers had encountered numerous drilling troubles such as sloughing and stuck pipe problems across a shale interval overlaying the reservoir. In a preliminary study the authors carried out, the instability phenomena contradicted to the simple theory of homogeneous material. For example, hole condition worsened in the highly deviated well although the stress regime is strike-slip fault type. The study aims to find out the root cause of such complex instability phenomena, to develop numerical method that can be used for mud weight optimization, and to establish the drilling guideline to mitigate the troubles Using the 3D poroelastic and laminated formation model, we found that wellbore condition can be worsened as hole inclination increase even in the strike-slip stress condition. In such case, higher mud weight cause wider failure area due to the fluid pressure penetration into weak planes of the laminated shale formation. The paper shows that the appropriate numerical method with three -dimensional poroelastic model with heterogeneous the strength and permeability can predict such unconventional wellbore instability phenomena. Introduction In the recent years, the oil industry has acknowledged the importance of mechanical wellbore stability problems. Some numerical tools are now commercially available. Such tools are basically based on the simple elastic theory in homogeneous and isotropic media. On the other hand, most of the wellbore instability problems have happened in shale formations. In shale, heterogeneity and anisotropy are common nature. The low permeable nature makes fluid-solid coupled approach important, because the effective stress around borehole changes dynamically in such rocks (Detournay and Cheng, 1988). Also, micro fissures can add discontinuous characters. In such formations, conventional analytical solutions and numerical methods based on the linear elastic theory do not work. By such reasons, many studies to improve the models have been done. To solve the problem in heterogeneous media, discrete element model (DEM ) are applied to the failure of fractured and discontinuous rocks (Santalleri,1992; Yamamoto et al., 2002). Aoki (1994, 1996) developed the modified analytical solution for laminated media. For the fluid-solid coupling, the analytical solution of inclined wells in poroelastic media have been developed (Ekbote et al., 2004; Abousleiman and Ekbote, 2005). In this paper, an example of a finite difference model (FDM ) code application for a poroelastic problem in a real field to explain the unconventional behavior of a shale formation of the field. Problem to be Solved The target formation is a cap rock of the reservoir of an oil field in the Middle East. Numerous drilling troubles such as tight hole and stuck pipe problems happened across a shale interval overlaying the carbonate reservoir. To solve the problem and reduce the drilling cost, Japan National Oil Corporation (former name of Japan Oil, Gas and Metals National Corporation, JOGMEC) conducted collaborative study with operating companies of the field. This study was a comprehensive one that includes statistic analysis of past drilling troubles, data acquisition in shale formation using wire line and LWD logging tools, laboratory testing using core and cuttings samples, analyses of chemical and mineralogical characters of the shale and formation fluid, and modelling studies using numerical and analytical solutions (Tantawi and Fadaq, 2000, Yamamoto et al., 2002, Yamamoto et al., 2004). In the preliminary studies, the authors found that the instability phenomena in the shale formation have some interesting features, and such features sometime contradict the conventional theory; such as: The stress condition of the format ion is evaluated as the strike-slip fault type. Under this type of stress condition, a inclined well is more stable than the vertical well. However, most of the drilling troubles due to shale instability happened in the highly deviated well.

AB  - AbstractPrevious theoretical researchers successfully generated viscous finger patterns by assuming a randomly distributed boundary condition in their numerical models. Our objective is to identify a natural source of the randomness that underlies their success. A source of fluid flow instability is discerned by viewing fingering as a chaotic (nonlinear dynamical) phenomenon.We begin by showing that miscible displacement models can be expressed as nonlinear generalizations of the linear convection-dispersion equation. A nonlinear dynamical analysis technique is used to study the stability of the nonlinear system. Detailed study of several 1D and 2D cases illustrates the applicability of the stability analysis. IntroductionViscous fingers play an important role in determining the success or failure of a fluid displacement process. Much effort has been expended in the study of viscous fingering, e.g., Refs. 1 and 2, yet several important problems remain to be solved. Among the problems awaiting explanation is the question of what causes the disturbances that propagate as viscous fingers. A widely held notion in the industry is that reservoir heterogeneities are the source of the disturbances. Previous work3 suggests that nonlinear dynamics provide an alternative perspective on the source of disturbances in porous media or analogs such as Hele-Shaw cells.Christie and Bond4 have recently applied chaotic concepts to the description of fingering. Their idea was to impose a boundary condition with a random distribution about a user-specified average value. They were able to numerically generate finger patterns using a nonlinear miscible displacement model. This work may be viewed as a numerical experiment that provides justification for applying chaos concepts to the viscous fingering problem.The introduction of a randomly distributed boundary condition is an assumption. Why does the assumption appear to work? What mechanism is responsible for the randomness? One obvious explanation for floods performed in porous media is the randomness associated with the flow paths of a porous medium.5-7 This answer is incomplete, however, because the presence of a porous medium is not a prerequisite for the appearance of viscous fingers. Indeed, pioneering studies of viscous fingering8-9 did not even use a porous medium. These studies used a seemingly simple system called a Hele-Shaw cell.10 Fluid flow in a Hele-Shaw cell is restricted to the space between two parallel plates. A well-constructed radial Hele-Shaw cell should exhibit radial symmetry. It would seem that the uniformity of a Hele-Shaw cell would preclude any cell related source of instability. That this is so is evidenced by the early time radial behavior observed at the inlet of 3 radial Hele-Shaw cell.2 Yet explanations of fingering in Hele-Shaw cells usually presuppose the presence of a perturbation in the system. Paterson, for example, introduced a sinusoidal perturbation in his analysis of a radial Hele-Shaw cell.11 What is the source of the perturbation?Kelkar and Gupta 12 reported that they were unable to initiate a viscous finger without introducing some type of perturbation such as a permeability variation or a concentration perturbation.

AB  - ABSTRACT:Energy dissipation due to sloshing liquid in torus-shaped nutation dampers is studied experimentally. An extensive test program with the dampers undergoing steady-state oscillatory translation is undertaken to establish the optimal parameters. Low liquid heights and large diameter ratios with the system operating at the liquid sloshing resonance are shown to result in increased damping. Tests with two- and three-dimensional models in laminar flow and boundary layer wind tunnels suggest that the dampers can successfully control both vortex resonance and galloping type of instabilities. Discussed in some detail is a design procedure for application of the damper to three distinct situations: (a) full-scale smokestacks undergoing vortex resonance; (b) wave-excited oscillations of offshore marine risers; and (c) horizontal pipelines. The information should prove useful, particularly in damping low-frequency oscillations. INTRODUCTIONVibration of mechanical systems is a universal phenomenon extending to space, atmosphere, earth and ocean based structures. Suppression of mechanical oscillations, forced or self-excited, or at least their minimization to an acceptable level, is a challenge faced by engineers. Librational/vibrational instabilities of satellites with large flexible appendages in the form of solar panels, antennas and booms are of interest to space engineers. With the U.S. commitment to the Space Station, a highly flexible gigantic structure with the fundamental natural frequency less than 0.1 Hz, the problems of vibration damping in space environment have become of prime concern. Broadly speaking they may be classified as: i) structural instability in absence of fluid dynamical input. Shimmy oscillation of automobile tires, chattering of machine tools, relaxation oscillations, etc., represent a small sample of vibration problems belonging to this category. ii) fluid-structure interaction instabilities. Here, we have a large class of industrial aerodynamics, nuclear reactor and offshore engineering oriented problems. Cermak (1975) has presented an excellent review of this literature.

AB  - ABSTRACT:By the numerical solution of the Rayleigh equation for complex frequency and complex wave number, the stability of four families of surface shear flow, which represent velocity profiles induced by wind over a water surface, has been investigated. It is shown that for flow of Froude number from 0.85 to 1.41, the unstable waves are primarily convective in nature. INTRODUCTIONA gust of wind blowing over a body of water induces a shear (vorticity) layer in the water just below the surface. This layer has been found to be unstable and may be a source of wind-induced surface waves. This mechanism of generation of surface waves by wind was first considered by Stem and Adam (1973) and further investigated by Voronovich et al. (1980) and Caponi et al. (1991). In particular, these authors studied the stability of wind-induced surface shear layers, which are represented as a layer of constant vorticity of finite thickness Δ and surface velocity us'' lying above a semi-infinite domain of stagnant fluid. Their investigations show that there exist unstable waves for a range of parameters, i.e., the wave speed c has a non-zero imaginary part corresponding to temporally unstable wave modes for a range of Us and Δ. The matrix eigenvalue formulation also reduces the risk that unstable eigenvalues may be missed. Below, we present the temporal stability results for the velocity profiles studied by Morland et al. The results confirm their basic findings. However, temporal stability is a highly idealized form of instability in which the perturbation is assumed to have a regular periodic spatial form. In reality, perturbation in unbounded physical system may be localized. The growth of perturbations which originate from localized disturbance is best described in terms of the spatial-temporal concepts of absolute instability and convective instability.

AB  - ABSTRACTInstability and movements of oceanfloor sediments are potential hazard to offshore and coastal structures, and a major geologic process of offshore sediment transport. In addition to gravity other environmental forces associated with wave storm and earthquakes may cause shear failure leading to oceanfloor Instability and mass movements. In this paper, the basic aspects of such instability and mass movements are examined and the current understanding of underlying mechanics and the available methods of analyses will be reviewed. In the framework of simplified analyses, the conditions necessary for such instability will be formulated, which may be used to identify potentially unstable sediments m a given offshore region.INTRODUCTIONIn the past few decades, the economic significance of submarine environments, need for land reclamation and waste disposal projects, and need for a better understanding of the planet earth, haveled to proliferation m engineering activities in the ocean. The activities associated with exploitation of offshore oil, gas, and mineral resources require Installation of bottom-mounted engineering structures such as pipelines, anchors, gravity structures, and platform structures and communication cables. The use of continental shelves and deeper water shelf slope region is growing and diversifying with technological developments. The instability and movements of oceanfloor sediments are potential hazard and constitute important considerations in the planning and design of such facilities (BJerrurn 1971; Sterling and Strohbeck, 1973). The occurrence of oceanfloor instability and mass movement, are common wide spread phenomena; (Moore, 1978, Saxov et al, 1982, Lee, et al, 1981). Active landsliding and areas of former instability are being identified by modem sophisticated geophysical survey techniques (prior and Coleman, 1984). There is evidence of oceanfloor instability in a wide variety of oceanic environments, from shallow water, nearshore zones, continental slopes, and beyond to the deep ocean floors. Oceanfloor instability have been responsible for the damage and destruction of offshore structures (Bea, 1983; Christian et al, 1974).

AB  - ABSTRACTThe pressures and the effective stresses in seabeds induced by waves are treated analytically based on Biot's three-dimensional consolidation theory. The wave induced pressures and stresses in a bed are strongly influenced by the permeability and the shear modulus of the soil, the compressibility of pore water, and the thickness of the bed. As a design example, a stress analysis is made for the North Sea design wave and seabed conditions. The numerical results indicate that the North Sea design waves will liquefy the top up to 2 m of the sand beds and induce the sliding failures in the top up to 8.0 m of the sand beds. The theory has been verified by a laboratory experiment for the wave induced pressures.INTRODUCTIONThe subject of wave induced pressures and stresses in seabeds is important with regard to the design of foundations for various ocean and near shore structures, such as gravity type breakwaters, offshore oil storage tanks, and drilling rigs like EKOFISH at North Sea. The subject is also important when one considers the problems of the flotation of buried pipelines and the burial of rubble mounds, tetorapods, and other blocks by waves. However, the subject is not well understood because the dynamic behavior of soils is difficult to express mathematically. When the water waves propagate over a porous bed such as a sand bed, the flow of fluid is induced in the porous medium and the porous medium itself is forced to deform. Thus, the bed response to water waves is actually a combination of fluid and solid mechanical effects. There have been numerous investigations of the problem of the flow induced in a porous bed by water waves, including Liu (1973), Massel (1976), Moshagen and Tørum (1975), Nakamura, et al. (1973), Putnam (1949), Reid and Kajiura (l957) and Sleath (1970). However, they all assumed that the porous beds are rigid and non deformable. In addition, all except Moshagen and Tørum (1975) and Nakamura, et al. (1973) assumed that the pore fluid is, incompressib1e. The fluid motion in the porous bed is usually expressed by Darcy's law which, with the assumption of a rigid bed with isotropic permeability and incompessible water, leads to the Laplace equation for the pore water pressure. The consequence of this theory is that the pore-water pressure response is independent of the permeability of the bed material. The approach taken by Nakamura, et al. (1973) and Moshagen and Tørum (1975) is based on the assumption that the water is compressible while the porous bed is non deformable which leads to the heat conduction equation for the pore-water pressure. The conclusion from this assumption was that the pore-water pressure response is strongly dependent on the permeability of the bed material. This approach provides no information on the wave induced stresses in seabeds.

AB  - ABSTRACT:In this paper we investigate the hydrodynamic stability of the flow through the Gibraltar straits using a simple model with rectilinear variation of the velocity, and piecewise constant variation of density. The equations of motion are linearized around this flow, and the absolute/convective character of the instability is determined. The parameters on the model are fitted using field measurements. It is shown that the presence of flow reversal is a necessary, but not sufficient, condition for the occurrence of absolute instability. For the flow through the Gibraltar Straits, stability analysis of field measurements shows that absolute instability develops in the flow over the Camarinal Sill, from 5 to 7 h after high water (when Atlantic water starts flowing eastward). Their periods vary throughout this time, from 10 min in the beginning to 48 min toward the end. The instability waves thus have an initially fast phase, and subsequently slow down, until they are eventually dissipated after the elimination of absolute instability conditions in the Straits. By computing the shapes of the eigenfunctions it is shown that the instability waves disturb mostly the upper layer of the ocean, and, to a lesser extent, the transition layer between the two counter flowing streams. INTRODUCTIONInternal waves in the ocean are one of the major factors influencing the biological synthesis in the ocean and have attracted considerable attention in recent years (Garret and Munk, 1979). Internal waves can be generated from a multitude of causes (see Phillips, 1977, and Garret and Munk, 1979, for comprehensive reviews). One important source of internal waves is hydrodynamic instabilities, developing in strongly sheared flows with stratification. The idea can be traced back to the work of G.I. Taylor (1931), and later to the work of Holmboe (1962) and Hazel (1972).

AB  - Abstract This paper investigates the additional oil recovery associated to viscoelastic flow instabilities encountered during polymer flooding. Single and two-phase polymer EOR experiments were conducted in micromodels that resemble porous media. To set a benchmark for non-viscoelastic flooding processes, Polystyrene Oxide (PEO) experiments are presented as well. The experimental workflow consists of three main steps. First, saturation of the micromodel with a synthetic oil. Second, displacement of synthetic oil by an aqueous PEO solution. Third, displacement of the remaining oil by a viscoelastic polymer solution. For evaluation purposes, viscosity of the polymer and polystyrene oxide solution are approximately matched. Furthermore, tracer particles are attached to the aqueous phase to enable high quality streamline visualization. The streamline data is gathered using a highspeed camera mounted on an epifluorescence microscope. In this study we demostrate that viscoelastic flow instabilities are highly caused and influenced by polymer properties. It is also shown flow instabilities dependence on pore space geometry and Darcy's velocity. We have observed a dependency of elastic turbulence on mechanical degradation, polymer concentration and solvent salinity. Furthermore, two-phase flood experiments in complex pore-scale geometries have confirmed that elastic flow inconsistency provides a mechanism capable of increasing oil phase mobilization by the viscoelastic aqueous phase. Due to high resolution particle tracing in the micromodels, the main causes of enhanced mobilization can be described as: (1) Moffatt vortices, (2) crossing streamlines, especially near grain surfaces and (3) steadily changing flow directions of streamlines. Thus, by adding viscoelastic additives to injection fluids and considering a sufficient shear rate, even a creeping flow is able to further enhance the displacement process in porous media by its elastic instabilities. This work provides an adittional understanding of pore-scale polymer displacement processes, namely oil mobilization due to elastic turbulence/flow instabilities. Using the potential of state-of-the-art micromodels enables to conduct high quality streamline visualization which is the key to an improved polymer EOR screening. Thereby enables to understand which properties of viscoelastic solutions contribute to oil recovery. Moreover, this analysis can be used to modify subsequently the fluid characteristics in order to achieve an optimized process application.

AB  - Simple closed-form solutions are obtained for the steady-state and transient forces and moments on a prismatic hull at speeds high enough for hydrostatic forces to be negligible and the chines to be above the undisturbed water surface (“chines dry”). We first show that this solution can be transformed to get the cor̂ect results for other hydrodynamic problems, such as the vertical impact of a wedge, a slender foil, or the two-dimensional planing of a flat plate. We then show that the full transient solution is essentially identical with Ribner’s [1]2 equations for delta wings, except for terms which depend on the reduction in wetted width with heave. These results are employed to study the stability of such a hull on the assumption that only heave and pitch degrees of freedom are important, following the reasoning of Per̂ing [2]. In contradistinction to all four previous studies [2-5], the effect of skin friction is included and is found to be very powerful. If the center of gravity is above the centroid of the wetted area (which it generally is), then the effect of skin friction is stabilizing.

AB  - AbstractThis paper discusses the experimental findings pertaining to the instability of breakwater foundation during huge tsunamis. A tsunami experiment system in a drum centrifuge was applied to reproducing the tsunami-induced seepage flow in the mound. The emphasis is placed on observations of the occurrence of seepage-induced instabilities in the mound around the toe of the caisson. It was found that the seepage induced instability of the foundation could bring about the significant displacement of the caisson, leading to the breakwater failure. The scour of the rubble mound and erosion of the sand bed were also observed under continued tsunami overflow.

AB  - Cavitation number σ is defined by σ = (p0 pk)/q. It can be controlled by controlling the dynamic pressure q, the ambient pressure p0, or, in the case of quasi-steady cavities, the internal cavity pressure pk. The present investigation was undertaken to study methods of controlling pk by adding air to the wakes of fully submerged bodies. This process has been called ventilation. It was found that for small air-flow rates, pk increased and σ decreased nearly linearly with the rate of air supply. It was also found that once σ had decreased to a certain critical value, further increase in the air supply rate would not produce a continuing linear decrease in σ. Rather, σ remained nearly constant and the cavities began to vibrate. Vibration occurred with one, two or more waves on the cavity surface. Only by going from a one-wave to a two-wave cavity could σ be reduced further, and the reduction was discontinuous. Both two-dimensional and finite aspect-ratio bodies were tested. The tests were conducted in the two-dimensional, vertical, free-jet water tunnel at the St. Anthony Falls Hydraulic Laboratory. All bodies tested, regardless of aspect ratio and whether lifting or nonlifting, behaved quite similarly within both the vibrating and nonvibrating regimes. That the vibration was not peculiar to the vertical free-jet tunnel was demonstrated by comparison with results from a hydrofoil towed in a tank. In the case of lifting bodies of finite span operating near a free surface, air was found to enter, rather than leave, the cavities through the trailing vortexes.

AB  - AbstractWith the petroleum industry endeavouring to develop oil and gas fields in deepwater and to increase its activities in onshore arctic environments, greater emphasis should be placed on quantifying the hazards to drilling operations posed by gas hydrates. In spite of gas hydrate-bearing sediments having been drilled successfully in the past, it is important, as future drilling operations progress into deeper and ultradeep waters, to develop a sound understanding of gas hydrate-related hazards and thereby identify ahead of time when problems are likely to occur. It is also highly desirable to define the envelope of risk-free operations so that unnecessary costs and delays associated with mitigation of the problems are not incurred.This paper describes the specific requirements to develop a comprehensive risk management capability for drilling in gas hydrate-bearing sediments. The methodology adopted concentrates on reducing risk and uncertainty associated with gas hydrates and associated shallow gas geohazards in deep water. These will be achieved by means of determining the petrophysical, mechanical and thermodynamic properties of gas hydrate-bearing sediments, and developing a fully coupled model for wellbore stability in the sediments, and methodology for drilling fluid design optimization and a risk assessment and optimization framework. Examples of laboratory measured petrophysical and mechanical properties of gas hydrate-bearing sediments, and results of time-dependent wellbore stability in such sediments are presented and discussed.IntroductionWith the petroleum industry endeavouring to develop oil and gas fields in deepwater and to increase its activities in onshore arctic environments, greater emphasis should be placed on quantifying the hazards to drilling operations posed by gas hydrates. Hydrates, or clathrates, are crystalline compounds formed as a result of combination of suitably sized non-polar or slightly polar molecules with water under low temperature and high pressure conditions. The necessary conditions for their formation could exist within the sediments of continental margins where thermogenic or biogenic sources of gas are present[1]. Biogenic source gas is generated from breakdown of organic matter by bacteria under the seafloor whilst gas of thermogenic source is from hydrocarbons generated much deeper that have flowed upward through fractures and faults. Many studies suggest that the source of naturally occurring hydrates is predominantly biogenic[2], composed maily of methane (generally >95%), carbon dioxide, ethane and traces of higher hydrocarbons.Drilling and testing efforts have been on-going in three hydrate accumulations viz. Mallik field in Northwest Territories, Canada, Prudhoe Bay/Kuparuk River area in Alaska, USA and Nankai Trough in offshore Japan[2,3,4]. Problems associated with stabilisation of in-situ hydrates so as to allow wells to be drilled safely with minimal gas levels have been reported in the development of the Cascade Field in the North Slope, Alaska[5]. Various other operating companies have described a range of problems associated with gas hydrates and free gas pockets, including uncontrolled gas release (including blowouts), fire, stuck pipe, catastrophic well-site subsidence, disruption of casing cementing operation, gas leakage to the surface outside of the casing and casing collapse[3].The cost of a deep water well can be up to $70 million with the cost of drilling amounting to tens of millions of dollars. Although gas hydrates potentially pose significant hazards to drilling operations, the documentation of actual incidents is somewhat limited. The operational database is lacking because little monitoring has taken place, there are few well logs available from the shallowest section and this section of the well has typically been drilled without the use of a riser return system. A cost effective approach to minimizing exposure to hydrate-related drilling risks must take into account the general operational environment of deep and ultradeep waters. Hence, a greater emphasis should be placed on quantifying the hazards and risk to drilling operations, including those in gas hydrates-bearing sediments, and developing risk envelope for safe deep water drilling.

AB  - Presented herein are the results of a theoretical study of the static and dynamic hydroelastic instabilities of rigid supercavitating hydrofoils on elastic supports. A two-dimensional theory is used to define the unsteady hydrodynamic force and moment acting on the oscillating foil, which is assumed to be elastically restrained in translation normal to the free-stream direction and in rotation about a prescribed axis which is normal to the plane of flow. All other motions are neglected. The effects of variation in the elastic and inertial properties, as well as the effect of varying the position of the upper surface flow-separation point on the possibility of either form of instability, are determined. Also, the effect of cavitation number over a small range near zero is hypothesized. The theory predicts that dynamic instability (bending-torsion flutter) is possible at the density ratios typical of supercavitating operation. This is in contrast to the results for fully-wetted flow, where the occurrence of flutter is unlikely at the structural-to-fluid density ratios typical of hydrodynamic operation. The flutter possible in supercavitated operation is also more severe than that indicated for fully-wetted flow. Furthermore, it is shown that for the supercavitating hydrofoil, static instability (torsional divergence) and dynamic instability are of equal importance which again differs from the results in fully-wetted flow where static instability was shown to be the more important practical problem. Recommendations are made for experimental studies to verify these theoretical results.

AB  - AbstractIt is commonly understood that clays have surface hydroxyls that are available for various interactions. The magnitude of the interactions possible because of the natural acidity that clays possess has been previously demonstrated.1 Laboratory experiments using a 3-ft Hassler sleeve and unconsolidated sand/claypacked columns demonstrated that the pH profile of buffered and unbuffered high-pH fluids can be readily understood as the result of two dominant mechanisms. The first mechanism is neutralization by the natural clay acidity. The second mechanism is the attack of hydroxide on clays and is demonstrated in this paper. The rate of hydroxide attack is temperature, clay, and pH dependent. The rate constants were used to develop a high-pH Clay Instability Rating (CIR) for the clays tested. The impact of CIR on injected-fluid pH profiles was numerically demonstrated with the new model for both linear and radial flow. These two geometries are relevant to leak-off during frac-packs (linear) and for drill-in fluids and matrix treatments (radial).IntroductionHigh-pH fluids have been used in our industry for several decades. Generally, the fluids are high-pH as a natural consequence of the bulk fluid requirements for which they are being used. Examples include high-pH drilling fluids, cement filtrates, steam injections, caustic stabilized bleach treatments, and borate crosslinked fluids. In each case the base fluid has a high pH because of something else required in the bulk fluid properties. Invasion of the high-pH fluid into the matrix is secondary. In some instances, even higher pH fluids are intentionally injected into the matrix, such as in caustic floods. The impact of high-pH fluids on sandstone formations has been studied predominantly in short cores in the laboratory. For the most part, high-pH fluids are considered nearly non-damaging to most sandstones, though concerns about this issue are raised from time to time.Geochemical modeling has been a useful tool for understanding high-pH injections. The issues of dispersion, ion exchange, and their impact on chemical injection have been mathematically and experimentally addressed by Lake, et al.2,3,4 The interactions of high-pH fluids with oil acidity and ion exchange have also been considered.5 The interactions have been combined into the well-known UTCHEM geochemical simulator. However, incorporation of high-pH fluids into the modeling was apparently inadequate for some purposes as improvements in understanding the interactions between fluid pH, surface hydroxyl deprotonation, and cation exchange capacity was further improved upon by Bazin and Labrid.6 Even with these developments, the powerful effect of ion exchange transformation of brines used for stimulation and remedial workovers escaped broad notice until recently.7,8 In a similar fashion, the powerful effect of clay acidity has only slowly been brought into proper awareness.The use of strong caustic fluids for clay stabilization is well known.9,10,11,12 However, the KOH concentrations for clay stabilization are normally in the 5 to 15% range, which is about 1 to 3 Molar in KOH and would essentially be a pH of 14 or greater. The impetus for the work in this paper was concern that high-pH fracturing fluids could cause fracture face damage. Normally this would not be a major concern in conventional fracturing treatments. However, it was considered possible that high-pH fluids could cause severe permeability loss at high temperatures. In addition, frac-pack treatments have deep matrix invasion and could again cause permeability losses that would affect production. Therefore, the goal of the work was to investigate the attack of high-pH fluids on clays. However, it was found that the dominant mechanism for lowering the injected fluid pH was clay acidity, which was addressed in a previous paper.1 The effects of attack of high-pH stimulation fluids on clays are addressed in this paper.

AB  - ABSTRACT:Instability and transition of effluent flow from Ocean Thermal Energy Conversion (OTEC) power plants to ambient ocean are numerically investigated by using finite difference method. The flow field is assumed to be two-dimensional. There are two types of the effluent flow. One is that the flow is lighter than the ambient ocean, which is called an overflow case. The other is that the flow is heavier than the ambient ocean, which is called an underflow case. Steady state solution of the overflow case is obtained for relatively small Reynolds number, whereas it becomes unstable and self-sustained oscillatory one at the critical Reynolds number. The critical Reynolds numbers are obtained for the overflow case. It is found that the self-sustained oscillatory flow occurs as a result of subcritical Hopf bifurcation. Moreover, it is seen that mass transfer near the inlet of the effluent flow increases after the bifurcation from steady state flow to oscillatory one. INTRODUCTIONInvestigation on the effluent flow of water with a different density from the power plants into ocean is of practical importance in the waterquality management of these water resources and the protection of the environment. There are two types of effluent flow. One is that the flow is lighter than the ambient ocean, and the other is that the flow is heavier than the ambient ocean. This is called an underflow case. A well-known example for this case is the cold effluent discharged from Ocean Thermal Energy Conversion (OTEC) power plants, where the deep ocean water are pumped up from the ocean depths in order to refrigerate the working fluid. Kao, Park and Pao (1978) investigated the inflow of a fluid of different density into an ambient fluid of uniform density and finite depth numerically.

AB  - AbstractBy using a full dynamic model for both the well and the near well reservoir, a large range of instabilities can be simulated. These instabilities include gas lift heading, severes slugging and compressibility effects. To simulate these types of fluctuations it is necessary to use an integrated dynamic model for the complete system. Using a constant productivity index to describe the inflow or using lift curves for the well are not sufficient to capture the dynamics. In this paper a well is described where reservoir-well interaction leads to unstable well behaviour. In order to investigate the cause for the unstable production a full dynamic model was developed for both the well and the near well reservoir. The simulation results are compared to field data of this well. The instabilities encountered at this well were explained by a combination of severe slugging in the well and the influence of the dynamics of the reservoir. The wellbore could act as a gas storage volume in which a pressure build up can take place. The well model used was a three phase dynamic models based of the drift flux formulation. For the reservoir basic single phase oil model was used to simulate a radial inflow. In the reservoir the compressibility of the oil is taken into account.IntroductionMost oil and gas wells become unstable during the production lifetime. These instabilities are generally undesirable as the large fluctuating oil, water and gas rate at the wellhead will result in a fluctuating load on the surface equipment. This will in practice limit the average production and the ultimate recovery. Therefore, it is preferable to stabilize the production rates. However, in practice the instabilities can arise from a multitude of causes. Well-known sources are the occurrence of gas lift heading and slug flow. Lesser known instabilities arise from the interaction between the well and the reservoir. This can occur when a gas or water cone breaks through. Besides the dynamics of oil inflow due to the compressibility of oil can cause unstable well performance. In this paper, some of the sources are discussed. This will be done based on field data of an unstable well. The objective of the study was to investigate different sources of instability and to evaluate the conceqences for the performance of the well. The goal of the project is to increase the ultimate recovery of a well by controlling the inflow and thereby increasing the operation range. In this paper we focus on the stability analysis of the well-reservoir system and less on the controllability. For this analysis, a dynamic well simulation model is used, which can be coupled to a dedicated reservoir model. The reservoir models can range from a simple volume, to a complex gas-oil-water model. In the results presented in this paper, the reservoir model is restricted to near well reservoir models. Hereafter a basic description of the well is given and the encountered instabilities are discussed. Then the model is described in more detail. The steady state simulation results are used for a first analysis of the model. Then the different instability sources are investigated. The pressure levels and frequency obtained from simulating the various types of instabilities are compared to measured data.Well and reservoir descriptionThe well under consideration is a well with a total length of 3150m (see Figure 1). The horizontal section of the well is approximately 550m long. The perforated section is 600m long. This section is an open bore hole protected only with a sandscreen. The well produces from a homogenous sandstone reservoir (50 mDarcy). The production zone has a thin oil layer with a current approximate thickness of 20m.With the large height difference in true vertical depth of the horizontal section this means that some sections of the perforations are in or near the water layer. Originally there was no gas cap, but as the reservoir pressure decreased, small gas caps have been detected close to the well bore. The well is equipped with a gas lift injection point at an axial position along the tube of x=2250m. This gaslift is operated with a choked injection valve. The injected mass flow is therefore constant. One downhole pressure gauge is available at x=2270m.

AB  - ABSTRACTVibration problems encountered by bluff bodies in ocean environment present considerable similarity to vortex resonance and galloping type of instabilities, extensively studied by industrial aerodynamicists. The paper briefly reviews control of this class of vibration problems using both passive as well as active procedures involving nutation dampers and the Moving Surface Boundary-layer Control (MSBC), respectively. It is suggested that both the procedures present considerable promise in resolving vibration problems of bluff offshore structures caused by ocean waves and currents. INTRODUCTIONVibration of mechanical systems is a universal phenomenon extending to outer space, continuum atmosphere, earth and ocean based structures. Suppression of mechanical oscillations, forced or self-excited, or at least their minimization to an acceptable level, is a challenge faced by engineers in all disciplines. Perhaps the earliest vibration problems caused by fluid flow, to receive significant as well as sustained attention, pertain to flutter and divergence of aerodynamic surfaces. Advent of the space age brought to light vibration problems of highly flexible large space structures [Modi, 1996], such as the proposed International Space Station Alpha, operating in the free molecular and microgravity environment. However, here the attention is focused on the earth and ocean based structures, usually bluff in geometry, subjected to wind, waves and currents. The spectacular collapse of the Tacoma Narrows Bridge in 1940 provided considerable impetus to the understanding of wind effects on civil engineering structures. Ever since, a vast body of literature aimed at fluid dynamics and dynamics of bluff bodies has evolved which has been reviewed quite effectively by Cermak (1975), Welt (1988), Modi et al. (1995), Seto (1996), Munshi (1996) and others. The fluidstructure interaction induced instabilities of concern have been the vortex resonance and self-excited oscillations of the galloping type.

AB  - Abstract Wellbore collapsing and formation leak off in drilling are all resulted from wellbore instability. So, researches on wellbore instability mechanism and its critical conditions can provide theoretical foundation on which is based to prevent wellbore instability in drilling. The paper introduces catastrophic theory for the first time to analyze wellbore instability mechanism and provide a new calculating method of wellbore instability thresholds in drilling. Taking the ground stress and the fluid seepage into account, the paper developes the potential energy function of rock around wellbore on the basis of the elastic-plastic theory. For the potential energy function, the catastrophic theory is applied here to analyze the mechanism of wellbore instability in drilling and obtain the safe range of mud density. Also, the paper analyzes the effect of some sensitive parameters. From sensitivity analysis, it indicates that the mud density results in wellbore instability chiefly, the trend of wellbore instability speeds up with the decrease of plastic zone permeability. Introduction Wellbore collapsing, formation leak off, bit freezing and many other troubles are resulted from wellbore instability in drilling. Prediction methods of wellbore instability are significant important for controlling wellbore instability in drilling. At present, the judgment conditions of wellbore instability are on the basis of rock failure criterions[1-3] mainly, which include Mohr-Coulumb criterion, Drucker-Prager criterion, Hoek-Brown criterion and so on. J.F.Shao[4,5] and A.Pellegrino[6] applied continuous damage model to analyze brittle rock instability. C.G.Ramling[7] presented a numerical discontinuous model of wellbore instability. F.J.Santarelli[8] applied UDEC model to analyze wellbore instability mechanism. This paper applied catastrophic theory[9] for the first time to analyze wellbore instability mechanism and obtain the critical instable conditions. As a new mathematics branch developed in 70th of the last century, the catastrophic theory is applied mainly to study on the non-continuous event in dynamic system and the jump qualitative change of continuous variable. The object of catastrophic theory investigated is potential function of system, on which is based to obtain the critical jump points and the discontinuous characteristic. The theory is especially applicable to work out the system that the internal action is unknown. Stress analysis of wellbore surrounding rock As the strain energy of wellbore surrounding rock is the object on that catastrophic theory research, the stress of wellbore surrounding rock is needed to analyze  firstly. It was assumed that all the surrounding rock being in elastic state initially. The damage of drilling made the properties of near wellbore rock changed into plastic state[10,11]. As figure.1 shows, the surrounding rock can be divided into elastic zone and plastic zone. Taking ground stress and fluid seepage into account, the stress and strain of surrounding rock can be obtained by the elastic-plastic theory.

AbstractIn order to find a solution or at least to minimize the consequences of borehole instability, two complementary approaches of the problem have been used : - Case history analysis : identify from the different types of drilling problems those related to a poor borehole behavior, characterize the conditions for occurrence and main consequences (breakouts, cavings, reaming, torque) in agreement with a proper geomechanical behavior of the borehole. Several independent, or interconnected factors are controlling the borehole stability ; high or low, isotropic or anisotropic horizontal stresses, particular rock rheological behavior, excessive wall stresses induced by fast tripping, pressure and temperature gradient around the borehole. - A comprehensive theoretical analysis providing a stress distribution around the borehole, avoiding irrelevant material behavior, and concentrating on the different loadings which may already explain most of the time-delayed instabilities (thermal and seepage stresses). Some major and unusual conclusions will be outlined : several rupture modes, maximum stress concentration inside the wall. Two documented case histories are described. They allow to be rather optimistic regarding the efficiency of this mixed approach of the problem in providing less empirical solutions to drilling problems. IntroductionUnexpected or unknown behavior of rock is often the cause of drilling difficulties, resulting in an expensive loss of time, sometimes in a loss of part or even whole borehole. Although less significant for drillers, borehole instabilities make logging very difficult to perform and also to interpret. A bad condition of the borehole wall, due to rupture for instance, alters artificially the annulus zone of rock corresponding to the depth of investigation of most of the logging tools. The shape of the borehole can be strongly modified giving elongated hole in one direction, diameter reduction in the other direction and also almost circular cavings in places. Cutting removal can be affected, plugging the annulus and making trips difficult. Moreover the quality of later cimentation can be jeopardized. Drill string sticking, casing collapse are sometimes also due to actual creep of the rock, in case of occuring salt, and other evaporites or some clays or claystones. Besides, it is very common to observe anomalies as regards instantaneous rate of penetration, torque, pull-out and run-in-hole difficulties, need for reaming, associated with these types of abnormal or unknown rock behavior. Regarding these problems, normal cures available in the state-of-art of drilling can be somewhat insufficient. Most of experienced drillers try to press their mud specialists for a proper adjustment of mud density, rheology, type of mud or additives. Increasing the mud density results sometimes disappointing with a very temporary improvement. Other solutions, for example as injecting specific products to minimize dragging or using a special drill string equipment (jars, turbines, non-rotative stabilizers, etc.) may be sometimes resultless too. Extra costs due to these problems need urgent decisions, but at that time, known data on the rock behavior are often inadequate to make a correct and accurate diagnosis of the actual cause of the problem, and to propose an appropriate remedy.

AB  - Based on a functional analysis approach, time history effects are introduced into the representation of the fluid forces associated with offshore structures operating at shallow draft, shallow submergence and/or having a multihull construction, etc. A general linear theory is developed illustrating the pattern of behavior expected in the structure when performing a free decay motion or a forced motion excited by sinusoidal waves. It is shown that even in a simple one-degree-of-freedom mathematical model describing the behavior of an offshore structure, multiple natural frequencies and resonances may be exhibited in the responses. These features are examined and the investigation extended to assess the possibility of multiple parametric instabilities arising in the motions. For this purpose, the mathematical model is slightly modified to include a specific sinusoidal time-dependent term—as is common in a Mathieu type analysis—and conditions determined allowing motion instabilities to occur. This is confirmed by simple numerical examples.

AB  - AbstractBorehole instability is primarily a rock mechanical problem. Regional earth stresses and typical rock strengths are used to explain the widespread nature of irregularly shaped, fragile boreholes in the western Canadian overthrust belt (foothills). Drilling fluids and practices are investigated using a rock mechanical model of borehole failure. Although drilling practices can significantly affect problems associated with borehole wall failure, they are not the primary cause.IntroductionBorehole instability is a major drilling problem in the western Canadian basin. A recent operator survey places the total industry dollars lost due to instability related drilling problems at $60 million per year (Can). Thirteen major operators estimate their average problem cost at $1.7 million per year. Individual wells in the foothills often experience instability problems that cost in excess of $250,000.Drilling problems associated with borehole wall failure are:1. Stuck pipe requiring fishing, washing over or plugging back and redrilling;2. Excessive time (days to weeks) reaming back to bottom after trips;3. Overpull on trips, connections and surveys; and4. Severe doglegs as a result of poor drill string stabilization in enlarged hole sections.Drilling personnel are well aware that shale formations cause the most severe drilling problems. However, the mechanism of failure has been the subject of considerable debate. Any valid model of borehole instability must explain the following shale sloughing characteristics:1. Exceptionally weak coals and shales can stick the bit immediately upon penetration;2. Most thick Cretaceous shales are stable during drilling but start to spall days or weeks after penetration;3. Considerable shale may be removed before the hole stabilizes - after a period of days or weeks, the sloughing may reoccur;4. Most boreholes in shales are out of gauge to some degree when drilled with water-based muds;5. Most sandstones and carbonates (limestones, dolomites) are close to bit gauge;6. Many boreholes are elliptical in shape with the long axis aligned parallel to the mountains - the short axis may be bit size or larger;7. The sloughing problems become more severe with time; and8. Shale sloughing occurs over a wide geographic area and depth range in western Canada.

AB  - AbstractBundles arrangements are currently used in the design of riser towers or oilexport lines. Some of them are characterized by a non-circular cross section[6] and therefore may be prone to plunge instability, so-called galloping orplunge instability when exposed to strong current. It is important to be ableto assess, at conceptual design stage, their likelihood of being subject tothis phenomenon.Galloping is taking place in the low frequency range compared to VIV, but withlarger amplitude, up to several diameters, which could be critical in term ofglobal motion. Galloping occurrence is related to the dissymmetry of the crosssection and then there is a risk for non-circular geometries, such as riserbundles, buoyancy tanks and floater columns. Instability can also occur intorsion or rotation by a coupling effect between transverse oscillations.Riser Vortex-Induced-Vibrations have been studied for decades, and numerousexperiments have been performed both in-situ and in model test facilities tounderstand and predict the response of a slender cylindrical structure in acurrent. The main reason is the influence of VIV on riser fatigue life.If galloping and fluttering are well known in aerodynamics [10], no largespecific experiment/study exists for hydrodynamic flows [1], [9]. So it is notevident to assess whether or not galloping may occur for a given riser bundledesign, and, in case of expected galloping, whether there is a potential riskof damage to the individual pipes in the bundle. Until recently, only theBlevins criteria [1] are available to predict the risk of instability but thereare limitations.Based on recent examples of riser tower, experimental and numericalinvestigations have been done within the CITEPH Gallopan project, with the goalto propose guidelines to help designing a bundle cross section in a way toavoid or reduce the risk of galloping.Two cross section shapes supported the investigations, the academic squarecross section, for which previous studies have been done [1], and a tokenbundle cross section expected to be subject to galloping. Model tests have beenperformed in two steps:• Captive tests and transverse forced oscillation tests in steady current toderive hydrodynamic coefficients (using a multi-DoF motions generator), to beused to check the Blevins instability criteria.• Free oscillations in steady current to identify the instability domain inrelation to the reduced velocity and to estimate galloping amplitudes. Aspecific experimental arrangement, based on a vertical pendulum system, hasbeen designed and set-up for this step.A methodology has been proposed to assess the risk and consequence of gallopinginstability using standard riser numerical tools in which hydrodynamiccoefficients are issued from model tests. This paper presents the main resultsof the Gallopan project in term of methodology based on model tests to analysegalloping occurrence and response for non-circular slender geometries. Usingthese results, it is now possible to develop a galloping-free riser bundledesign.

AB  - AbstractCurrently, the so-called state-of-practice approaches are commonly used inriser VIV analysis. DNV RP F204 has indicated that riser axial stress fatiguedue to VIV is not considered due to the limitation of the state-of-practiceapproach. This paper gives a methodology for considering the top tensionedriser (TTR) axial stress fatigue due to VIV, using nonlinear coupledbeam-column modeling, and proposes a procedure, using Flexcom and Shear7, toconduct TTR axial stress fatigue damage analysis. Case studies are discussed,including TTR VIV in the Gulf of Mexico (GoM) and West of Africa (WoA).On the other hand, API RP 2RD suggests that TTR with relatively stifftensioning systems may experience tension fluctuations that are significantrelative to the mean tension, leading to significant changes in the lateralstiffness. Further, it was found in field tests in Norway that if VIV frequencycoincides with half the TTR axial mode frequency, extreme axial stressesresult. This paper demonstrates that the phenomenon observed in the field testis due to the Mathieu effects. Using Mathieu theory on TTR axial stressresonance due to VIV is a novel idea and this paper provides a novelmethodology to assess Mathieu Instability (MI), specifically, stabilitydiagrams with damping effects in parameter plans are generated. These diagramsare intended to cover possible combinations of TTR properties, such aspre-tension, mass, damping, axial and bending stiffness etc. Finally, thispaper illustrates applications of new method in total VIV fatigue analysis,including axial fatigue, and MI engineering assessment.IntroductionIn offshore oil exploration and development, fatigue damage associated with VIVposes significant challenges in the TTR design. MARINTEK has carried out largescale riser model testing (Huse, et al., 1998) and research on VIV inducedriser axial vibrations (Huse et al. 1999). During their model testing in Fjordsin Norway, unexpected considerable riser tension fluctuations due to VIV werefound. Based on their investigations, it was found that if VIV frequencycoincides with half the frequency of the first axial vibratory mode of theriser, extreme stresses occur. This paper presents a theory that explains theTTR axial fatigue based on the physical mechanism of MI.At present, the state-of-practice in riser VIV fatigue analysis is the Shear7software. DNV-RP-F204 (DNV, 2010) indicates that the limitation ofstate-of-practice approach is that axial stress damage due to VIV is notincluded due to the complexity of its nonlinear nature. Also it indicates thatTTR axial stress due to cross-flow VIV analysis would require a nonlinear timedomain analysis. This paper proposes a methodthat combines a dynamic finiteelement software (such as Flexcom) with Shear7, for the calculation of TTRaxial stress fatigue due to VIV. In this paper the proposed theory is appliedto a TTR to predict both axial and bending fatigue life. First, cross-flow VIVresponse is predicted using Flexcom and Shear7, then forced axial vibrationsolutions are derived and solved using simple (e.g., MATLAB) programming.

AB  - 1 ABSTRACT Three phase flow system instabilities have recently been investigated in a 3" flowline-riser medium scale model system at the Equinor Porsgrunn test facilities in Norway. The test setup is well instrumented and comprises an 87 [m] long horizontal flowline followed by a 13 [m] high C-shaped riser. At riser top the riser is connected to both 1st and 2nd stage separators, thus reflecting a setup similar to that typically found in a real offshore flowline-riser process plant system. The model fluids used in the current work are air, Exxsol D60 and a viscous water/MEG phase. The system pressure is 4 [bara]. In this paper selected experimental results and observations will be presented, supporting increased understanding of the underlying physical phenomena and the coupled system instability resulting from interaction between the different process elements. Selected OLGA simulations are also presented. 2 INTRODUCTION Three phase surge wave instabilities have been observed in the Mikkel/Midgard (1, 2013) and Snøhvit (2, 2009) gas condensate fields at turn down rates and during late life production. This phenomenon can have large operational effects on a receiving facility. For the Mikkel/Midgard fields, which are tied back to the Åsgard B platform, the instabilities enforce minimum flow rates in the flowlines due to liquid handling of the surges topside. Åsgard B has also experienced hydrate problems related to no liquid MEG inhibitor arriving topside between each liquid surge. In a recent study (3, 2017) it was demonstrated that a 1D transient flow model can reproduce the observed surge waves at Åsgard B. The model, which was tuned against field data from Åsgard B, predicts that the surges originate in the lazy-S riser at Åsgard B due to water/MEG accumulation with no water/MEG arriving topside between each surge. The field data and model show that condensate arrives topside also in the accumulation period. The model predicts that along with the release of the accumulated water/MEG from the riser a condensate surge is initiated in the flowline close to the riser.

AB  - SPE MembersAbstractAs a major component in the development of better flow models for the "cold production" process in heavy oils, formation of a foamy fluid phase during flow of a liquid containing dissolved gas toward a wellbore is considered. The appearance of gas bubbles in the flowing fluid is described by the theory of nucleation. Unlike previous approaches, the foamy state is interpreted as a metastable state which starts developing at pressures below the bubble-point of a gas-fluid phase diagram. The amount of gaseous phase is determined kinetically, that is, by the rate of nucleation. Mass balance analysis for the compound foamy fluid gives the spatio-temporal evolution of the foamy zone which starts growing around the wellbore Fluid pressure in the foamy zone exhibits a steeper gradient, compared to the non-foamy flow. The conditions of sand production instability via tensile failure at the foamy front are also determined, and this constitutes a condition for liquefaction and loss of effective stress in the granular medium.IntroductionSeveral studies show that many heavy-oil reservoirs in Alberta and Saskatchewan exhibit foamy-oil behaviour, which leads to better than expected primary production. This behaviour is accompanied by sand production, and it is also realized that sand control measures tend to massively reduce the oil production rate. These observations suggest that the sand production might be physically linked to foamy-oil flow.A new, physics-based model for massive sand production has been developed for the case of one-phase fluid flow. If pressure in a borehole in an unconsolidated sandstone under general stress is lowered below some critical magnitude, the shear yield condition may become fulfilled, and a yielded and flowing zone may start growing around the wellbore.P. 113

AB  - ABSTRACT :This paper assembles and reviews documents of past submarine slope instabilities. Those are large in size and highly various in nature. Most of those past events were caused by one of or combination of earthquakes, heavy wave loadings, rapid sedimentation. and others. This paper studies the mechanism of instability induced by these causes in detail with reference to results of laboratory and model testings.INTRODUCTIONOffshore developments have been activated only in the past few decades. Human land reclamation together with offshore mineral exploration have not experienced much natural disasters. Apparently submarine slope instability is one of those hazards. As new types of construction occurs in the sea. new kind of disasters are encountered. Hence. it is necessary to understand what happens in the sea but not to simply extend onshore experiences to the marine environment. This report is intended to meet with this need by reviewing past slope instabilities in the sea. It interprets them with knowledges obtained by laboratory soil testings and model tests. REVIEW OF CASE HISTORIESLocation of Submarine Instability There are many case-history reports of submarine slope instability and they have been assembled by. for example. Terzaghi (1956). Morgenstern (1967). and Schwarz (1982). The present authors make a similar attempt here. According to the present knowledge. instability is more likely to occur near the land because 1) soft soil deposits off river mouths. 2) slope inclination is greater near the land. 3) wave loading is important only near-shore. and 4) the earthquake activity is high along the perimeter of the Pacific Ocean. Since there could be an unknown cause of instability in the deep sea. further study should be conducted bottom of the ocean as well. Location of submarine slope instabilities however. on the bottom of the ocean as well

AB  - ABSTRACT:A laboratory-scale downhole simulation cell is a triaxial drilling chamber with pore fluid and mud circulation systems. Samples of outcrop and downhole smectite shales are stabilized, drilled using a microbit and a fresh water lignosulfonate mud, followed by mud circulation. When the pore pressure is lower than the mud pressure, the near-wellbore clay minerals hydrate by imbibing water from the mud, resulting in swelling and weakening. Elastic-plastic analyses show that the rings of gum-like swollen shale may have formed along the locus of maximum tangential stress. The back-calculated strength of the mud-altered shale is 10 to 100 times less than the original shale.1 INTRODUCTIONIn petroleum drilling, operational problems are frequently encountered when going through formations containing shales. Problems such as high torque, excessive drag and stuck pipe may be due to swelling of the clay minerals that expand upon contact with the drilling mud. Conventional diagnostic tests to evaluate drilling mud and shale compatibility are typically conducted on non-preserved shales and drill cuttings (Darley 1969) often in unstressed conditions (Chenevert 1970). For more reliable results, tests should use representative native shales under simulated in situ environment because volume expansion and failure depend on chemical reactions as well as temperature, fluid pressure and rock stress. The optimal samples are actual cores of the same formation but this is costly and may require an oil-base mud to minimize core damage. The alternative, near-surface outcrops of similar shales, are cheaper but they are usually saturated with water and may not behave like downhole shales. Current numerical models for borehole stability are good for reservoir sandstones and they ignore mud and shale chemical interactions (Addis et al., 1990). Development of a shale wellbore stability model requires quantitative laboratory data on strength and stresses in mud-damaged shales. To create a laboratory-scale downhole environment, a Downhole Simulation Cell, or DSC, was built to duplicate bottom hole pressures, temperatures, rock stress and permit prolonged periods of mud exposure to a freshly drilled surface of shale (Simpson et al., 1989). The DSC is a novel method and the results of four tests described here demonstrate the mechanisms behind mud-induced wellbore damage and wellbore instability. 2 SHALE SAMPLES AND DOWNHOLE SIMULATION CELLTroublesome shale formations rich in expandable minerals like the mix- layers of smectite and illite are often encountered during drilling. Samples from two shale formations were used and compared: near-surface outcrop Pierre shale (Missouri River basin, South Dakota) and downhole Oligocene shale (horizontally bedded from 2100 m subsea). Though these two formations are from different localities and depths, both are marine deposits and classified as smectite or "expandable" shales. The Pierre shale in this location is a Cretaceous marine sediment with a maximum depth of burial of a few thousand feet and has not undergone depth diagenesis (Schultz 1978). The source outcrops have horizontal bedding planes with a slight dip in some areas, an indication of the absence of uplifts and folds which were observed in other Pierre shale outcrops.

AB  - Abstract Significant wellbore instability problems are being experienced during the drilling of horizontal wells in a shaly sand member of the Khafji reservoir in Zuluf field. This paper presents the results from a case study that integrates detailed rock mechanics and swelling tests with information from petrophysical logs and core properties acquired to evaluate, define and predict the instability mechanism in this portion of the Khafji reservoir. The study has tackled the effect of drilling fluid on shale strength and swelling. Additionally the effects of water activity, osmosis and hydraulic diffusion on shale stability were investigated. The mechanical properties and stress field in the khafji shale was determined. The results provided recommendations to minimize instability problems encountered during drilling. All drilling fluids that have water phase including the oil-based drilling fluid were found to cause instability problems. However all-oil drilling fluid was found to maintain shale strength. Drilling mud salinity to encourage reverse osmosis was determined based on measurement of shale-pore-water salinity. The critical mud weight window was calculated considering the Chemoporoelastic properties of the Khafji shale. Introduction Drilling through shale formation usually causes over 90% of wellbore stability problems. These problems can be a simple washout to complete collapse of the hole. The problems of shale stability are related to the mechanical properties (strength and deformation under stress), the drilling fluids properties (weight, chemical makeup and brine concentration), the in-situ stress field, time dependant temperature, and time spent in open hole. Drilling extended-reach wells with long open hole intervals has been increasing. Oil based mud (OBM) have been the industry choice for difficult drilling. Their application has been typically justified on the basis of borehole stability, fluid loss, filter cake quality, lubricity, and temperature stability. Water-based muds (WBM) are attractive replacements from a direct cost point-of-view. Past efforts to develop improved WBM for shale drilling have been hampered by a limited understanding of the drilling fluid/shale interaction phenomenon. This limited understanding has resulted in drilling fluids designed with non-optimum properties required to prevent the onset of borehole instability. Modeling has been used to determine the mud weight window to minimize wellbore instability. In this study we used PBORE-3D developed through the Rock Mechanics Consortium of the Oklahoma University.

AB  - SPE Members Abstract Flow instabilities can occur in pipeline-riser systems operating at low liquid and gas rates, leading to an undesirable cyclic operation. Traditional methods for elimination of riser flow instabilities are choking and gas lift. However, each of these methods suffers from operational disadvantages. Choking can increase the back pressure, thereby, reducing production, while gas lift requires large volumes of injected gas. The objective of this paper is to investigate existing methods and to propose a more optimum method for the elimination or minimization riser flow instabilities. An experimental study has been conducted to predict the behavior of the different methods of elimination of riser instabilities. It was found out that a combination of gas lift and choking is an efficient elimination method, reducing both the required degree of choking and the amount of injected gas required to stabilize the flow in the riser. The proposed method is less sensitive to choke setting and injected gas volume, as compared to elimination by either choking or gas lift alone. Additional advantage is the capability of a smooth and controlled start-up of the system. This study demonstrates the usefulness of flow pattern maps as a simple and effective tool for the visualization and prediction of flow occurrence of flow instabilities. Theoretical criteria have therefore been developed to predict the flow behavior for riser base gas lift and riser top choking. Introduction Flow instabilities can occur in a pipeline riser system where a downward inclined or undulating horizontal pipeline is connected to a vertical riser. For such a system, at low liquid and gas rates, liquid can accumulate in the riser and the pipeline, blocking the flow of gas. This results in a compression of the gas in the pipeline. If the liquid buildup in the riser is faster than the pressure increase in the pipeline due to the compression of the gas, the liquid level will continue to rise until the top of the riser is reached. When the gas pressure in the pipeline has increased sufficiently to counter the hydrostatic head of the liquid column, the gas will expand and push the entire liquid column out of the riser and into the separator. causing a blowout. During severe slugging one can experience periods of no liquid and gas production into the separator, followed by very high liquid and gas rates when the liquid slug is being produced. This is undesirable due to the large pressure and flow rate fluctuations it causes. The large liquid production can cause possible overflow and shut down of the separator. Fluctuations in gas production can cause operational problems during flaring, and pressure fluctuations can reduce the production capacity of the field. Severe slugging is by definition the buildup of liquid slugs equal to or longer than one riser height. Severe slugging is normally described as a cyclic phenomena consisting of four phases: 1. slug formation, 2. slug production, 3. blowout, and 4. liquid fall back. However, cyclic riser instability with the buildup of slugs shorter than one riser height can also occur, but these are normally of a less severe nature. P. 195^

AB  - AbstractThe problem of penetration of a fluid into a porous medium containing a more viscous liquid is investigated. It is known that the displacement front may become unstable in this case because it may break up into "fingers". The problem of inception of fingers has been treated previously in the literature by describing the displacement front in terms of its Fourier transform. In the present paper, we generalize earlier procedures by making allowance for an arbitrary elemental growth law. Furthermore, we assume that the phenomenon of fingering is not solely governed by the prevailing flow potentials, but also by the spectrum of heterogeneities in the porous medium. This is achieved by introducing a constant characteristic of the frequency of the heterogeneities in the porous medium. It then turns out that the maximum rate of growth as a function of wave length is considerably shifted from that predicted in the literature. At the same time it is also shown that the difficulty encountered by other workers, which consists of small wave lengths growing at an infinitely high rate, is being avoided.IntroductionWhen a fluid enters a porous medium displacing a more viscous liquid, an interesting kind of instability may occur at the displacement front. Protuberances may arise which shoot through the porous medium at relatively great speed, leaving behind the large amounts of the liquid intended to be displaced. This phenomenon is commonly referred to as "fingering".The problem of fingering is an extremely involved one owing to the complexity of the phenomenon. To treat it theoretically, drastic simplifications have to be made. One way to do this is to confine one's attention to the very beginning of the occurrence of the instabilities. The displacement equations can then be linearized, the displacement front can be described by its Fourier transform and the growth law for each spectral component can be deduced.An attempt along these lines has recently been published by Chuoke, et al., who showed how the prevailing flow potentials affect the various spectral components of a displacement front on the verge of instability. Chuoke's formula contains a capillary pressure term as an essential feature; if the limit is taken with this term being set equal to zero, a disconcerting difficulty arises. The spectral components with the smallest wave lengths are found to grow at the fastest rate; in fact, the rate becomes infinite for the wave length approaching zero.

AB  - Summary Even at constant inlet and outlet boundary conditions (represented by gas and liquid mass flow rates and separator pressure, respectively), unsteady-state flow may occur in a pipeline/riser system operating at relatively low gas and liquid flow rates. The cyclic unsteady-state flow characterized by large-amplitude pressure and flow rate fluctuations has been referred to as severe slugging. This study is an experimental investigation of flow instabilities, especially severe slugging, in a relatively long hilly-terrain pipeline/ riser system. Five types of flow regimes were found and characterized on the basis of visual observation and the measured pressure drop over the riser.

AB  - Abstract Linear and nonlinear stability analysis of flow instabilities gas-lift wells with water coning was performed in this paper. A new gas-lift stability criterion, which takes into account water coning, was developed. The criterion was used to analyze flow instability in an offshore gas-lift well. The effect of the water-coning performance on the conditions of the onset of instabilities was investigated. The nonlinear analysis showed that one of the most important instability modes in gas-lift wells is associated with two types of density waves: liquid and water holdup waves. Flow instability in gas-lift wells may result in that the maximum instantaneous liquid flow rate may be several times larger the average liquid flow rate for long periods of time (tens of minutes) in one cycle of oscillation. It was shown that water coning has a strong destabilizing effect on the flow in gas lift wells with a large vertical distance between the injection point and perforations. In some cases heading in such wells cannot be eliminated by increasing the wellhead pressure. One of the most important instability modes in gas-lift wells is associated with two types of density waves: liquid and water holdup waves. Introduction Flow instability in gas-lift wells (heading) is an undesirable phenomenon because it causes a number of operational problems (Alhanati, 1993). Two different methods have been proposed to analyze gas-lift stability: the linear and non-linear stability analysis. Using the linear stability theory, Asheim (1988), Alhanati et al.(1993) et al. and Blick et al. (1988) proposed simple criteria that can be used to check the stability of the gas-lift system under a given operating condition. The non-linear stability analysis is based on transient simulations of fluid flows (multiphase flow in the well and lift-gas flow in casing annulus) in a gas-lift system. More detailed reviews of studies on gas-lift instability can be found in previous studies on this topic, Poblano et al., (2004), Fairuzov et al. (2004). In wells that produce from oil zones underlain by "bottom water?? water coning may occur (Weiping and Wattenbarger, 1991). When the well is produced, water moves up and, at certain conditions, breaks through into the well; thereafter concurrent oil and water production begins. After water breakthrough has occurred, the water cut at the bottomhole becomes dependent on the liquid flow rate (Weiping and Wattenbarger, 1991) . The higher is the liquid flow rate, the higher is the water cut. Critical coning rate is the maximum oil production rate at which the well produces oil without concurrent production of water by coning. Severe heading in gas-lift wells is characterized by large variations in both the wellhead and bottomhole pressure (Fig. 1). The amplitude of the bottomwhole pressure oscillations may be of the same order of magnitude as the drawdown. In this case, the liquid flow rate at bottomhole also oscillates: the maximum instantaneous liquid flow rate may be several times larger the average liquid flow rate for long periods of time (tens of minutes) in one cycle of oscillation. When the maximum liquid flow rate exceeds the critical coning rate, an additional increase in the water production rate occurs in unstable gas-lift wells with water coning. Fig. 2 shows variations in time of gas, liquid, and oil flow rates measured by a multiphase flow meter at the wellhead. Variation of water cut calculated based on the measured liquid and oil flow rates is also shown on the graph. The water cut reaches maximum when the liquid flow rate is maximum. Although the field data presented in Fig. 2 correspond to measurements performed at the wellhead, they provide insight into the behavior of multiphase flow at the bottomhole of unstable gas-liquid well experiencing water coning. The slip between oil and water in vertical flow is small, so the water cut variation observed at the surface indicates that the oil and water flow rate oscillations are not in phase at the bottomhole.

AB  - Abstract High-temperature electric submersible pumps (ESPs) are the most commonly used artificial lift method in steam-assisted gravity drainage (SAGD) wells. While conceptually the SAGD process should provide a low-viscosity single-phase flow to the ESP system, changing pressures and temperatures associated with well drawdown create opportunities for introduction of free gas, water vapor, or both, resulting in multiphase flow regimes. This can often lead to wellbore flow instability and ESP performance deterioration. An innovative approach to understanding ESP performance in multiphase flow conditions in SAGD production wells was developed by Shang, S. and Gomez-Bustamante, N. (2017), using well-specific fluid PVT characteristics to create the produced mixture's phase envelope. This analytical approach is able to identify phase boundaries, determine gas-water vapor volume fraction (GWVF), and predict flow regimes as a function of surface and downhole flowing measurements. In this case study, the authors extend the modeling work done by Shang, S. and Gomez-Bustamante, N. (2017) with the objectives of constructing a wellbore model that includes the complex downhole completion, conducting transient analysis of the entire wellbore, analyzing slugging characteristics both upstream and downstream of the ESP, and ultimately providing operational recommendations to maximize well drawdown while maintaining wellbore stability.

AB  - Prof. Jin S. Chung Award Lecture, 2015 Flow patterns around bodies undergoing flow-induced vibrations and biomimetic flows have intriguing similarities, and similar flow mechanisms can be used to understand their principal properties and find ways to alter their behavior. The long history and extensive study of flow-structure interaction allowed the rapid development of the new field of biomimetic fluid mechanics. In return, the properties that were revealed and the discoveries that were made through the study of the swimming of fish and cetaceans and of bird flight are now entering the engineering domain, suggesting new ways to control the flow and how to devise new technology as well as invigorating our profession. Introduction Flow-structure interaction is a problem of great importance to ocean and offshore engineering, coastal engineering, and mechanical engineering. Flow mechanisms have been explored for the purpose of reducing loads on large and small structures, cables, risers, and hawsers. Theoretical and experimental results derived from studies around structures have found application to a totally new field of study, biomimetic fluid mechanics, i.e., the mechanisms employed by swimming and flying animals for propulsion and maneuvering. For example, intriguing similarities between the flow patterns behind swimming animals and in the wake of structures placed in cross-flow have led to the identification of similar flow mechanisms that can be used to understand the principal properties of both classes of systems. In return, the discoveries made through the study of the swimming of aquatic animals and of bird flight can now be used in engineering to better control the flow and to devise novel technologies such as novel sensors and actuators. The proliferation of articles in engineering journals on biomimetics and the plethora of new biomimetic journals promise that this exchange will continue in the years to come. Exploring Flow Instability Mechanisms One of the most extensively studied topics in flow-structure interaction is the spontaneous formation of the Karman street behind bluff bodies in cross-flow that results in vortex-induced oscillations of flexible or flexibly mounted structures (Bearman, 1984; Williamson, 1996; Williamson and Govardhan, 2004; Zdravkovich, 1997; Triantafyllou, Bourguet, et al., 2016). For fixed bodies and despite the fact that the oncoming cross-flow is steady, the wake flow becomes unstable, generating streets of vortices of alternating-sign vorticity that induce oscillatory loads at the Strouhal frequency. The instability is attributed to the doubly inflected time-averaged velocity profile that causes an absolute instability (Bers, 1983; Triantafyllou et al., 1986; Huerre and Monkewitz, 1990), i.e., a flow instability with a preferred frequency that propagates both upstream and downstream, overwhelming the entire flow. The frequency of maximum growth dominates the response, and its value is related to the average velocity profile.

AB  - ABSTRACT:In this paper, a comparative study of the relationship between droplet entrainment and Kelvin-Helmholtz (K-H) instability is presented. In a channel experiment oil droplets were formed on the oil-water interface and entrained by the water current causing droplet entrainment when the velocity was about O.25m1s for a flat plate boom with O.05m draft in a channel of 1m width and 1m depth. This experimental result has been successfully simulated using the computational fluid dynamics (CFD) software Fluent. The onset of droplet entrainment is due to K-H instability which has been modeled by Fluent. Based on numerical computations the process of droplet entrainment and the evolution of K-H instability are animated. 1. INTRODUCTIONOil spills on water occurring when shipping crude oil or its products through marine waterways may pollute the environment. The performance of oil recovery systems is an important factor in mitigating the effects of oil spilled on water. If oil is spilled on the surface of water, the most common response is to contain the oil using a boom towed by boats and, then, to recover it using a skimmer. A boom is a barrier that floats on the surface of the water and contains the spilled oil. A typical boom is composed of a cylindrical float with a skirt. Experiments and experience have shown that when the towing speed is about O.5kt, the boom often fails to contain the oil and the oil escapes underneath the boom due to hydrodynamic forces. This severely limits the capability of oil containment booms. The oil spill response community has a serious concern about how to improve the capability of current booms and how to design more efficient new booms. Boom characteristics have been studied since the late 1960''s.

AB  - ABSTRACT: The authors provide an insight into the mechanisms that caused failure phenomena in the subaerial and submerged slope of Stromboli volcano in 2002. Landslide geometry and deformations are described and then the results of laboratory investigations into the mechanical behaviour of the volcanoclastic material are presented. Experimental results contribute to explaining the evolution of instability processes towards failure in the submerged slope as well as the current evolution of the volcano flank. Finally, a 3D numerical model of the volcano flank is utilized to investigate the role of intruded magma in initiating instability phenomena. 1 INTRODUCTION The evolution of most of the volcanic edifices is characterized by a succession of instabilities ranging from small-scale landslides to deep-seated failures that are usually triggered by intruded magma. Failures events often threaten inhabited area either directly or indirectly (e.g. inducing tsunamis or longrunout debris flows). Geomechanics plays a key role in understanding instability mechanism and in evaluating hazard. Unfortunately the extremely impervious and dangerous environments of active volcanoes often limit collection of geotechnical data. As a result, analyses of slope evolution and failure mechanisms are necessarily based on limited geological evidence and monitoring data, laboratory tests only on near-surface materials and schematic numerical models. This combined approach was applied to the analysis of the sequence of slope failures that occurred at Stromboli volcano in December 2002, which generated two tsunami waves responsible of serious damage to coastal areas. 2 GEOLOGICAL OUTLINES AND INSTABILITIES AT STROMBOLI VOLCANO Stromboli Island is located 60 km north of Sicily and represents the subaerial part of a 4000 m high volcanic edifice about two-thirds of which is below the sea level. The subaerial part is a broadly regular cone, slightly elongated in the SW-NE direction, whose flanks dip at up to 38°.

AB  - ABSTRACT Instability and movements of oceanfloor sediments are potentially hazardous to offshore and coastal structures, and a major geologic process of offshore sediment transport. In addition to gravity, other environmental forces associated with wave storm and earthquakes may cause shear failure leading to oceanfloor instability and mass movements. In this paper, the basic aspects of such instability and mass movements are examined, and the current understanding of underlying mechanics and the available methods of analyses are reviewed. In the framework of simplified analyses, the conditions necessary for such instability will be formulated, which may be used to identify potentially unstable sediments in a given offshore region. INTRODUCTION In the past few decades, the economic significance of submarine environments, and the need for land reclamation and waste disposal projects have led to proliferation of engineering activities in the ocean. The activities associated with exploitation of offshore oil, gas and mineral resources require installation of bottommounted engineering structures such as pipelines, anchors, gravity structures, and platform structures and communication cables. The use of continental shelves and the deeper-water shelf-slope region is growing and diversifying with technological developments. The instability and movements of oceanfloor sediments are potentially hazardous and constitute important considerations in the planning and design of such facilities (Bjerrum, 1971; Sterling and Strohbeck, 1973). The occurrence of oceanfloor instability and mass movement is a widespread phenomenon (Moore, 1978; Saxov et al., 1982; Lee et al., 1981). Active landsliding and areas of former instability are being identified by sophisticated geophysical survey techniques (Prior and Coleman, 1984). There is evidence of oceanfloor instability in a wide variety of oceanic environment, from shallow water, near-shore zones, continental slopes and beyond to the deep ocean floors. Oceanfloor instability has been responsible for the damage and destruction of offshore structures (Bea, 1983; Christian et al., 1974).

AB  - Abstract This research work outlines the main results of the shale instability study with respect to shale/ fluid interaction mechanisms, and also analyses the shale strength properties. An approach was undertaken to develop a better understanding of the effects of using polymer drilling fluid on the shale mechanical properties and how to optimize its performance. Wellbore stability in shale is very much influenced by the type of drilling fluid used, here the problems observed were, borehole fluid invasion into the shale, increase in potential pipe sticking, swelling/hydration of shale which results in high level of non-production time (NPT). Different drilling fluids were analyzed for their effects on shale strength. Emphasis here was on the mechanical properties of the shale samples after exposed to different drilling fluids for 24hours. The mud which maintains high compressive strength of the shale is the most preferred (optimum) selection. The shale sample exposed to the polymer drilling fluid shows the lowest strength, from the stress-strain curve. The use of KCl brine in drilling fluids is based on its shale inhibition characteristics as it is thought that the k+ ion provides additional attraction among the clay platelets due to its size and charge. However the shale loses most part of its strength when exposed to the modified polymer drilling muds combined with 5% KCl, 7%, 10% KCl respectively. One of the possible reasons is Kaolinite in the shale. The shale samples will keep more of its original strength when exposed to the modified polymer drilling muds combined with chemical agents with plugging ability to pore throat and micro-fracture. The shale sample exposed to polymer drilling fluid with 10%Nacl, 5% Physical sealing agent and 10% Chemical agent A1 (rich in silica) exhibit the highest strength. From the result of the experiment the drilling fluid density has been reduced immensely, thus the new mud system improves the wellbore stability and keeps the shale formation stable.

Todistinguish between the two papers, the filename extension -A has been added tothe 1975 paper and the filename extension -B has been added to this paper.ABSTRACTSimultaneous measurements of bottom oscillations and wave characteristics havebeen made in a study of the interaction of fine-grained sediments and surfacewaves. Wave staffs, pressure sensors, and an electromagnetic current meter wereplaced 150 ft from a bottom-emplaced accelerometer package at East Bay,Louisiana. Measurements were made in about 64 ft of water from an oil platformin -an area having a fine-grained clay bottom. Sediment core samples were takento a depth of 180 ft. The accelerometer package Consisted of three solid-stateaccelerometers mounted at right angles, and had a response of 3 v/g. Thepackage was placed about 1 ft below the mudline.The results of the experiments indicate that bottom motions under wave actionshow well defined periodic features. Bottom oscillations on the order of 1 in.in amplitude occurred for seas having a significant wave height of about 3 ftand a period of 5 sec. The-bottom appears to be undergoing an elastic waveresponse to bottom pressures, so that the bottom is depressed under a surfacewave crest. Comparison of wave height measurements and pressure measurementsindicate that bottom pressures are not predicted by linear theory for a rigidbottom. Pressures were larger than predicted by up to 35% in many cases.INTRODUCTIONExperience in the Mississippi Delta has indicated that large vertical andlateral dislocations of the continental shelf sea floor occur in associationwith the passage of storm waves over the area.1 The interaction ofwaves with soft sediments has been the subject of several theoretical studies.2 ,3 However, the only data available has come from a laboratorystudy.4 This report presents the results of-a field study involvingdirect observations of waves and resulting sea floor oscillations.This study was conducted as part of an interdisciplinary investigation of themechanism responsible for mass movement in the Mississippi Delta region.Previous studies have indicated that several deformational processes can beidentified from sediment brings, high-resolution seismic profiles, side-scansonar tracks, and repeated hydrographic surveys.5,6 These featuresinclude (a) peripheral faulting and slumping, (b) radial graben and tensionalfaulting, (c) differential weighting and diapirism, (d) degassing and massflowage, (e) deep-seated clay flowage (mud noses), (f) shelf edge rotationalslumps and normal faults, and (g) deep-seated normal faults. The distributionof these features within the Mississippi Delta region shows that distinctivepatterns may be correlated with water depth and nearness to the river passes.The role that sedimentary gas plays in causing sediment instability has alsobeen reported. High concentrations of methane corresponded to zones of-lowsediment shear strengths. The coexistence of methane and sulfate within bottomsediments was suggested as an indication of recent sediment movement.Previous work on the interaction of waves with a flexible bottom has indicatedthat the forcing function is associated with the pressures induced by surfacewaves. Wave pressures measured in a laboratory study were in significantdisagreement with values predicted on the basis of standard procedures.4 Movement of the bottom thus may be affecting wave-inducedpressures.

AB  - Abstract Slug to annular flow pattern transition (SAT) taking place during the upward gas-liquid well transportation is a source of flow instabilities often experienced with conventional gas lifting as well as with unloading operations of water accumulated at the bottom level of gas wells in low-pressure gas or coalbed reservoirs. In order to minimize the pressure drop and gas compression work, gas lifting of relatively large volumes of fluid (oil and water) uses mainly a slug flow pattern while the production of gas with relatively small amounts of condensate or water (unloading operation) uses an annular flow pattern. In both situations, significant decreasing of tubing pressure from perforation to wellhead levels, is associated to significant increase of superficial gas velocity, may induce flow pattern transitions (usually from bubble to slugs and, further from slugs to annular). This paper uses field data and laboratory measurements to suggest that SAT can be a source of flow instabilities and should be avoided. Understanding and proper prediction of SAT is particularly essential for developing suitable production operations and for designing effective gas lifting or unloading strategies from low-pressure gas and oil reservoirs (including upward transportation of hot fluids resulting from steam-assisted heavy oil operations). With depletion of existing gas reservoirs trend the need for effective gas well deliquification is in great demand. Transportation of water produced at the perforation level (usually between 10-60 m3/d) over a vertical depth of 200 to 2000 m under low (often variable) reservoir pressure (< 50 m of water) ask for finding un-conventional and effective artificial lifting strategies. Improving the understanding of gas-liquid upward transportation mechanisms including the avoidance of instabilities induced by flow pattern transitions is essential. This paper addresses this problem through laboratory measurements of steady and oscillatory components of flow-pressure under a broad range of gas injected rate and simulated reservoir pressures. Comparison of laboratory data with existing STA models is performed first; selected models are then tested for field situations. Effective field strategies for avoiding the SAT occurrence using either a slug or an annular flow pattern regime under low-pressure and standard (IPR) reservoir conditions are discussed in view of practical field applications and selection of a suitable gas lifting strategy. Introduction Simultaneous production of gas, liquids hydrocarbons and water through vertical wells is a common situation for both land and off-shore production systems. Depletion of conventional oil and gas reservoirs and continuous increase of world oil and gas demands ask for a re-visitation of conventional production strategies. These should include production from extremely low pressure reservoirs as well as off-shore large-volume and large pipe diameters not used for conventional production so far.[1] Many gas wells are now dormant due to a combined effect of low reservoir pressure and bottomhole accumulation of water. Similar problems encountered with exploitation of deep coalbed gas reserves are asking for economic and practical production methods. Selection of a particular well unloading strategy which may include ESP, PC, rod and jet pumps, as well as gas lifting or various combinations has to use a location-specific design including the most suitable flow pattern transport. Often dry operation conditions and the presence of free gas considerably increases the maintenance costs with most of conventional mechanical pumping systems and suggests the need for a robust artificial lift strategy without mechanical moving components.

AB  - ABSTRACTFluid flow effects on bluff structures include higher drag resistance as well as vortex resonance and galloping type of instabilities. Vibrations of tall structures such as buildings, bridges, chimneys, offshore platforms, marine risers and a wide variety of other configurations have been of interest to engineers and scientists. Recent advances in material science and computer-aided design have led to structures with reduced stiffness, making them prone to .wind and earthquake as well as ocean waves and current-excited oscillations. A structural member with square cross-section is frequently encountered in such civil, mechanical and ocean engineering applications. The present study assesses the effectiveness of the Moving Surface Boundary-layer Control (MSBC) with reference to the drag reduction and vibration suppression of a two-dimensional square prism. To begin with the effects of the momentum injection parameter VelV (Vo cylinder surface velocity; V, free stream velocity) and angle of attack on the surface pressure distribution, resultant forces and wake characteristics are evaluated using an organized wind-tunnel static test investigation. Next, dynamic studies are undertaken to assess its effectiveness in suppressing both vortex resonance and galloping type of instabilities. Finally, the wind-tunnel test results are complemented by an extensive flow visualization study. The results suggest that the boundary-layer control through momentum injection can significantly reduce drag and effectively control flow-induced instabilities. INTRODUCTIONThe phenomenon of flow separation and the associated turbulent vortex wake is the most characteristic feature of an incompressible flow past a bluff body over a wide range of Reynolds numbers (l ≤Re ≤107) At the point of separation the thickness of the shear layer abruptly changes from 0(Re-1I2) upstream to 00) downstream in case of laminar separation (Brown and Stewartson, 1969). The recirculating region downstream of the body alters the effective body shape, hence the inviscid flow around it.

AB  - Abstract Early work in the area of instability theory is limited in that it is based on first-order perturbation theory and the concept of a velocity potential. Thus, while it can deal with an incipient finger, it cannot deal with the subsequent growth of a finger. This paper develops a new approach to the instability theory that overcomes this limitation. The new approach, like earlier work, is based on the assumption that the immiscible displacement of one fluid by another can be treated as a moving-boundary problem. Therefore, two solutions arise, one for each side of the plane interface that initially separates the two fluids. plane interface that initially separates the two fluids. Because the new approach makes use of a force potential rather than a velocity potential, it is possible to impose several new conditions on these two solutions. As a consequence, further extensions to the stability theory have been obtained. In particular, it is now possible to predict the steady-state velocity at which a finger propagates and, consequently, the breakthrough recovery obtained not only when the displacement is stable, but also when it is pseudostable. pseudostable. Introduction It has been recognized for some time 1 that viscous fingering can play a significant role in the immiscible displacement of one fluid by another. This led a number of people to attempt a theoretical description of viscous fingering. Many of these attempts are based on first-order perturbation theory. When this approach is taken, it is usual to postulate the existence of a velocity potential. Then, if the divergence of the perturbation velocity is identically equal to zero, the postulated velocity potential will satisfy Laplace's equation. There are several problems with this approach. First, a velocity potential exists only for fields of flow involving a fluid of constant density and viscosity and a porous medium that is homogeneous and isotropic throughout. Thus it is debatable whether results based on the concept of a velocity potential have any application when the porous medium is not ideal. Second, the concept of a porous medium is not ideal. Second, the concept of a velocity potential has only kinematical significance and gives no insight whatsoever into the dynamic properties of the flow. As a consequence, when a velocity potential is used, one cannot infer how variations in rock and fluid properties might affect the perturbation velocity. properties might affect the perturbation velocity. Finally, the divergence of the perturbation velocity is zero only when a plane interface separates the displaced fluid from the displacing fluid. As soon as the interface is perturbed, two fluids will occupy a region where there was previously only one, and the divergence of the perturbation velocity will no longer be zero. Rather, the perturbation velocity will no longer be zero. Rather, the divergence of the sum of the perturbation velocities, one for each fluid, will be zero. Thus, while first-order perturbation theory can deal with an incipient finger, it perturbation theory can deal with an incipient finger, it cannot deal with the subsequent growth of the finger. The purpose of this paper is to develop a theory for viscous purpose of this paper is to develop a theory for viscous fingering that does not suffer from the aforementioned limitations that arise from the use of a velocity potential. The new theory, which is based on the concept of a force potential, not only explicitly accounts for the dynamic flow potential, not only explicitly accounts for the dynamic flow properties of both fluids, but also is capable of delineating properties of both fluids, but also is capable of delineating the entire life-span of the growing finger. Theory Fluid Displacement. To develop the theory presented in subsequent sections, it is necessary to have a working model of how one fluid displaces another. Such a model must be simple to keep the mathematics tractable. Consequently, it is usual to assume that the displaced and displacing fluids are separated initially by a plane interface and that the porous medium is ideal. If the porous medium is truly ideal (in the sense that the size and shape of all flow paths are identical), the displaced and displacing fluids will continue to be separated during the course of a displacement by a saturation discontinuity (or shock), provided the displacement is stable. 4 Thus stable provided the displacement is stable. 4 Thus stable displacements of this kind can be treated as a moving boundary problem. However, any real porous medium will contain a distribution of pore sizes. As a consequence, different parts of an initially plane interface will move at different parts of an initially plane interface will move at different velocities through the porous medium; i.e., a distribution of saturations will evolve to separate that part of the porous medium where only displacing fluid is flowing from that where only displaced fluid is flowing. The length and shape of this transition zone will depend not only on the pore-size distribution of the porous medium, but also on pore-size distribution of the porous medium, but also on the balance between viscous, gravity, and capillary forces that exists at each point along the saturation profile during the course of the displacement. Moreover, the shape of the saturation profile can be predicted by conventional displacement theory " if the displacement is stable. Even in an ideal porous medium, the displacement front separating the fluids may become unstable under certain conditions. Consequently, a distribution of saturations will evolve again to separate the two regions where only one fluid is flowing. However, the length and shape of this transition region will differ markedly from that which results from a distribution of pore sizes. SPEJ P. 765

AB  - Summary In this paper, we present a simple nonlinear dynamic model that is shown to capture the essential dynamics of the casing-heading instability in gas lift wells despite the complex nature of two-phase flow. Using the model, stability maps are generated showing regions of stable and unstable settings for the production valve governing the flow of produced oil and gas from the tubing. Optimal steady-state production is shown to lie well within the unstable region, corresponding to an oil-production rate that cannot be sustained without automatic control. Three simple control structures are suggested that successfully stabilize the casing-heading instability in simulations, and more importantly in laboratory experiments. Introduction Artificial lift is a common technique to increase tail-end production from mature fields, and injection of gas is among the most widely used methods. Gas is injected into the tubing as deep as possible and mixes with the fluid from the reservoir (see Fig. 1). Because the gas has lower density than the reservoir fluid, the density of the fluid in the tubing and, consequently, the downhole pressure decrease. As the downhole pressure decreases, the production from the reservoir increases. The lift gas is routed from the surface and into the annulus, which is the volume between the casing and the tubing, and enters the tubing through a valve, or an injection orifice. Backflow from the tubing into the annulus is not permitted by this valve. Gas lift can induce severe production flow oscillations because of casing-heading instability, a phenomenon that originates from dynamic interaction between injection gas in the casing and the multiphase fluid in the tubing. The fluctuating flow typically has an oscillation period of a few hours and is distinctly different from short-term oscillations caused by hydrodynamic slugging. The casing-heading instability introduces two production-related challenges. Average production is decreased as compared to a stable-flow regime and the highly oscillatory flow puts strain on downstream equipment. Reports from industry as well as academia suggest that automatic control (feedback control) is a powerful tool to eliminate casing-heading instability and increase production from gas lift wells (Kinderen and Dunham 1998; Jansen et al. 1999; Dalsmo et al. 2002; Boisard et al. 2002; Hu and Golan 2003; Eikrem et al. 2006; Aamo et al. 2005). Understanding and predicting conditions under which a gas lift well will exhibit flow instability is important in every production-planning situation. This problem has been adressed by several authors by constructing stability maps, [i.e., a 2D diagram that shows the regions of stable and unstable production of a well (Eikrem et al. 2006; Poblano et al. 2005; Fairuzov et al. 2004)]. The axes may define the operating conditions in terms of gas-injection rate and production-choke opening or wellhead pressure. In this paper, we present three different control structures for stabilizing casing-heading instability in gas lift wells. Stability is analyzed for each controller, and it is shown how feedback control stabilizes performance, at least locally, around some operating point. The performance of the controllers is demonstrated in simulations, but more importantly, stabilization is also achieved in laboratory experiments. The paper is organized as follows: A desription of the laboratory facilities that are used in this work is given. Thereafter, the dynamics of casing-heading instability are discussed, and suitable models for analysis and design are proposed. The proposed control structures are presented along with stability analysis, closed-loop simulations, and experimental results. The paper ends with conclusions.

AB  - ABSTRACTThe phenomenon of surface instabilities is usually observed on swelling hydrogels in experiments. The instabilities are owing to small surface imperfections when hydrogels sustain large deformations caused by swelling under certain confinement. This research provides a fundamental framework of instability analysis for three-dimensional perturbed surface patterns on the hydrogel layers under biaxial stretches. The dependences of the critical swelling ratio on the selection of the gel and solvent system are discussed for the case of equal-biaxial confinement using instability maps.

AB  - ABSTRACT:Mississippi Delta platform sediments are incipiently unstable because of extremely high sedimentation rates, relatively steep bottom slopes, and the formation of biogenic methane. Thus, sediment failure is easily initiated and large quantities of sediment may be moved down slope en masse. The region is a source of large quantities of oil and gas, however, the recurring mass movements adversely affect recovery of those resources. To better understand these failures and, thereby, improve resource management, a simplified analytical model that treats the failure mechanism as a sedimentation and slope over steepening process and sediment motion as a propagating kinematic wave is developed. The model allows estimation of sedimentation rates necessary to initiate slope failures for a range of observed depths of basal shear planes along which the failures occur. Model results indicate that slope over steepening is a viable slope failure mechanism. INTRODUCTIONThe subaqueous portion of the Mississippi Delta platform annually receives approximately 2 x 1011 kg of sedimentary materials from the Mississippi River (Milliman and Meade, 1983). A large proportion of those sediments are deposited during the few months of the year when the river is in flood. Estimates of point accumulations of sediment range from about 70 cm during a seasonal flood event (Adams and others 1987) to more than 4.0 m during extreme floods (Coleman and others 1980). Because of those extremely high sedimentation rates that result in under consolidation, the relatively steep bottom slopes, and the formation of biogenic methane, sediments of the delta front are highly unstable, slope failure is easily initiated, and highly mobile deltaic sediments may be moved down slope under the influence of gravity (Coleman and others 1980). The mass movement transport system is represented, in part, by an extensive system of cross-shelf trending elongate mudflow gullies.

AB  - Abstract The Chinguetti field located west of the Mauritania coastline has recently experienced a slugging condition in its flowline and riser systems. A study was undertaken in which integrated production system models of Chinguetti wells, flowlines and risers were developed using OLGA® transient multiphase flow simulator. The field is at a water depth of ~800m and was developed with subsea wells, manifolds, 2 flexible flowlines and lazy "S?? shaped risers tied back to a permanently moored turret Floating Production Storage Offloading (FPSO) located 6km away from the furthest drill centre. The main objective of the study was to assess slugging and potential methods to improve flow stability in the Chinguetti systems. An extensive field validation and benchmarking exercise was performed by tuning the models to match field pressures and phase flowrates in the systems. The goal was to validate the models as closely imitating the conditions in the field. However, uncertainties in the field data made it difficult to reach satisfactory results in the benchmarking exercise. Simulations were then performed to examine the impact of various changes in operating conditions on flow instability. These included changes in well routings, gas lift injection rates and location of injection points, riser and wellhead choke openings. The degree of fluctuations in liquid arrival rates and the characteristics of liquid slugs (length and frequency) were used to categorize the severity of flow instabilities for a range of operating conditions. Results from field implementation of recommended changes in operating conditions indicated improvement in flow stability. The success of this study was found to be dependent not only upon the inputs and assumptions made in the production system models but also on the outcome of the field validation exercises, and the understanding of pertinent governing factors influencing slugging behavior. The study highlights the methodology and analysis used to assess flow instability, outcome of field implementation, challenges faced and solutions proposed to minimize the flow instability of a deepwater oil field development. Introduction The Chinguetti deepwater oil field of the Mauritania coastline has been producing oil since February 2006 and has recently experienced a flow instability condition in its deepwater flowlines and risers. Flow instability or commonly referred to as slugging is defined by an unsteady, alternating flow of liquid slugs and gas pockets or by periodical change of pressure and gas-liquid flows. A study was conducted to assess the slugging phenomena and the potential methods to improve flow stability in the Chinguetti deepwater systems. The field is at a water depth of 800m was discovered in 2001 and the production was started in February 2006. A schematic of the Chinguetti field development is illustrated in Figure 1. The crude oil has a specific gravity in the order of 25-30 deg API. Excess gas is injected at Banda gas field which is approximately 17km away from Chinguetti. The field was developed with subsea wells, manifolds, flexible flowlines and risers tied back to a permanently moored FPSO with a maximum storage capacity of 1.67 million barrels of oil. The production is sent through a dual 10-inch piggable flowline and riser. The production from the wells is distributed via three production manifolds (drill centres DC1, DC2 and DC3). The looped production flowline allows the system to be dead-oil-displaced during shutdown. The field is equipped with gas lift and water injection systems arranged in a daisy-chain configuration to improve oil production and ultimate recovery from the reservoir.

AB  - ABSTRACT: This paper outlines a solution approach for evaluating the stability of casing and faults due to reservoir compaction. Firstly, a geomechanics model is presented for the evaluation of casing failure due to reservoir compaction. Secondly, a threedimensional finite element analysis is coupled with the developed geomechanics compaction model for the detailed casing failure analysis. Deformations and stresses are determined on a cylindrical surface surrounding the length of the newly drilled or completed wellbore in the regions of interest. This cylindrical surface is sufficiently remote from the wellbore so that the wellbore has no or little influence on the stresses and displacements due to the reservoir compaction on this surface. The calculated displacements on the cylindrical surface are then used as boundary conditions for a focused near-wellbore stress and strain analysis using finite element technology. This hybrid analysis affords evaluating the near wellbore details that are often glossed over with a fastly compacted solution not requiring multimillion FEA cells. Yet, it preserves the fine details around the wellbore and allows for incorporating fault loading and macro influences of geologic structures and reservoir extent. It preserves the material balance and does not alter the pressure volume relationship in the reservoir void space. Interface elements can account for the slippage between the casing and the cement and between the formation rock and the cement. Field cases are presented for both the geomechanics model and hybrid finite element model. 1. INTRODUCTIONDepletion can generate large vertical deformation in the vicinity of reservoirs, especially in the Gulf of Mexico, where reservoirs are typically deep, multilayered, over-pressured and weakly cemented sands and silt sequences. Rock geomechanics plays a major role in both the recovery mechanisms and the integrity of the reserve delivery via well survivability. Hence it becomes necessary for the operators in these fields to carry out geomechanics assurance of reserve delivery by assessing the risk of well and casing failure, evaluating fault seal integrity during production, and by analyzing the impact of reservoir compaction on the integrity and recovery of the reservoir's resources. The results of these evaluations would assist the operators in devising appropriate strategies for more optimal recovery of the hydrocarbon from deepwater reservoirs. The studies must be aimed at a careful evaluation of the reservoir's pore volume compressibility, the impact of pressure depletion on reservoir recovery, production rates, fault movements, and well casing integrity [1-7]. Issues related to the impact of compaction on pressure maintenance, total recovery, and the survivability of well casing and completions have been well documented in various reservoirs worldwide such as in the North America fields in California, Western Canada and in the Gulf of Mexico. Many fields have experienced well failures (as illustrated in Figure 1) and loss of productivity following pressure depletion and reservoir compaction. This risk adds to the economic and technical challenges of developing deepwater reservoirs. While the industry has access to large coupled finite elements (FE) software that can model rock and casing deformations caused by pressure changes, widespread use of these packages is severely hampered by several vital factors, such as, lack of long-term reservoir performance forecasts and strategy studies needed by the reservoir engineers, unnecessarily large number (several million) of model cells required for the FE analysis, and lack of sufficiently detailed description of the rock properties for these cells.

AB  - Summary Flow-pattern instabilities have frequently been observed in both conventional gas-lifting and unloading operations of water and oil in low-pressure gas and coalbed reservoirs. This paper identifies the slug-to-annular flow-pattern transition (STA) during upward gas/liquid transportation as a potential cause of flow instability in these operations. It is recommended that the slug-flow pattern be used mainly to minimize the pressure drop and gas compression work associated with gas-lifting large volumes of oil and water. Conversely, the annular flow pattern should be used during the unloading operation to produce gas with relatively small amounts of water and condensate. In both procedures, a considerable decrease in tubing pressure from the perforation levels to the wellhead levels results in a major increase in superficial gas velocity. It is believed that this occurrence may well induce the unstable flow that occurs during STA.  Understanding and accurate prediction of flow pattern transitions, such as those that occur in STA, is imperative for the development of suitable production operations and effective gas-lifting and unloading strategies. New and efficient artificial lifting strategies are required to transport the liquid out of the depleted gas or coalbed reservoir level to the surface. This paper presents field data and laboratory measurements supporting the hypothesis that STA significantly contributes to flow instabilities and should therefore be avoided in upward gas/liquid transportation operations. Laboratory high-speed measurements of flow-pressure components under a broad range of gas-injection rates including STA have also been included in the paper to illustrate the onset of large STA-related flow-pressure oscillations. The latter body of data provides important insights into gas deliquification mechanisms and identifies potential solutions for improved gas-lifting and unloading procedures. A comparison of laboratory data with existing STA models was performed first. Selected models were then numerically tested in field situations. Effective field strategies for avoiding STA occurrence in marginal and new (offshore) field applications (i.e., through the use of a slug or annular flow pattern regimen from the bottomhole to wellhead levels) are discussed in this paper. Introduction Simultaneous production of gas, liquid hydrocarbons, and water through vertical wells is a common occurrence in both land and offshore production operations. However, the current depletion of conventional oil and gas reservoirs, coupled with unrelenting global demand for these resources, requires a re-examination of conventional production strategies. In particular, procedures for liquid and gas production in extremely low-pressure reservoirs, as well as methods for offshore transportation of large fluid volumes, must be re-evaluated. Because of the combined effects of low reservoir pressure and bottomhole accumulation of water, many gas wells are now dormant. Deep coalbed reservoirs, considered to be a valuable source of gas, are experiencing similar liquid-water unloading problems. Knowledge of mechanistic modeling of gas/liquid flow systems is essential for the development of suitable production strategies for both depleted and mega offshore gas/oil reservoirs (Oliemans 1994; Taitel et al. 1980; Turner et al. 1969). Slug-to-annular (STA) flow pattern transition, including the intermediate churn condition, is considered to be a potential source of flow-pressure instability and is given special attention in this paper. Whether churn is a stand-alone flow pattern or a transition stage between slugs and developed annular flowis currently under debate (Taitel et al. 1980; Pickering et al. 2001; Mao and Dukler 1993). Highly turbulent gas flow makes it difficult to visually assess the occurrence and evolution of STA and, as a result, the definition of churn remains in dispute.

AB  - AbstractShales play a major role in the stability of slopes, both natural and engineered. This paper attempts to provide a review of the state-of-the-art in shale slope stability. The complexities of shale terminology and classification are first reviewed followed by a brief discussion of the important physical and mechanical properties of relevance to shale slope stability. The varied mechanisms of shale slope stability are outlined and their importance highlighted by reference to international shale slope failures. Stability analysis and modelling of anisotropic rock slope masses are briefly discussed and the potential role of brittle rock fracture and damage highlighted. A short review of shale slopes in open pits is presented.IntroductionShales have been stated to form approximately 58% of sedimentary rock so it is not surprising that they are frequently encountered in both natural and engineered slopes. They represent challenging environments for slope stability due to the wide variation in their engineering properties, their changing behaviour with time due to geomorphic processes and the variation in the failure mechanisms as a function of both stratigraphy and tectonics. An extensive body of literature exists on the terminology and classification relevant to shales; it is not possible in the scope and length of the current paper to review these works in detail and the reader is referred to Farrokhrouz and Asef (2013), Bell (2000) and Goodman (1993) for detailed discussions. It is arguably the case that no universally accepted classification of shales exists today and depending on the field of application the terminology varies widely. Shales in slope stability, for the purpose of this keynote paper, are taken to include material varying in properties from weak rocks to soils and therein lies one of the most challenging aspects in shale slope characterisation for engineering purposes. They have been classified as "rock-like" or "soil-like’, (Underwood 1967) or compacted and cemented, Table 1, Yagiz (2001). Classifications have considered numerous factors including composition, cementation and a wide range of engineering properties.The propensity of shales to degrade with time due to geomorphic processes has resulted in an important aspect in their classification, that is, the attempts to incorporate slaking, durability and swelling and softening behavior through purpose developed testing methods (Gamble 1971, Morgenstern and Eigenbrod, 1974). Figures 1 and 2 show examples of terminology used to describe argillaceous materials and some proposed engineering classification schemes (Grainger 1984 and Bott 1986). Corominas (2014) provides a recent classification of argillaceous rocks and their durability relating five stages of slope deterioration to the texture of the rock on Ternary diagrams. No attempt will be made here to discuss the merits of the proposed terminology and classifications, suffice it to say, that the controversy and flux surrounding these issues is a strong indicator of the complexities in the behavior of these materials. In this paper the author will consider slope stability in the materials indicated in Table 1, Figures 1 and 2 without undue focus on terminology. At the lower strength limit of shales the engineer must design slopes using the principles of soil mechanics which may vary from the simple Mohr Coulomb plasticity constitutive criterion to modified critical state models, some even attempting to incorporate softening behaviour in the weaker clay shale materials. Given the transitional nature of shale materials several workers have treated overconsolidated clays and clay shales using concepts such as peak and residual shear strength, brittleness index and softening. Martin and Stacey (2013) provide a useful review of the importance of weak rocks in open pit mining, with mudrocks as a specific member, and note the importance of delayed failure, progressive failure and loosening in the stability of weak mudstone slopes.

AB  - Abstract Due to its limited drainage radius, the sand face pressure in a hydraulically fractured, horizontal shale oil well will fall rapidly with cumulative production. Once the sand face pressure falls below the bubble point, flow instabilities will increase dramatically. The onset of instability can be predicted using a transient multiphase simulator such as OLGA1, and techniques to minimize instabilities can be quantitatively investigated through simulation. This paper describes flow instabilities in a typical horizontal shale oil well and demonstrates both causes and remedies for fluctuating production rates in the intermediate and latter stages of well life. Through the suppression of production instability, the ultimate recovery of reserves may be significantly increased. Introduction Through the use of horizontal drilling and hydraulic fracturing techniques, oil and gas reserves in previously un-economic, low permeability, shales can be recovered. Upon initial production, the reservoir pressure is frequently sufficiently high that the sand face pressure is above the reservoir fluid bubble point. The resulting single phase liquid flow in the wellbore can be produced at stable rates, simplifying the design and operation of surface facilities. Due to the limited drainage radius, however, the reservoir pressure will fall rapidly with cumulative production. As a result, sand face pressures may fall below the reservoir fluid bubble point within months of the start of production. When this occurs, a vapor liquid flow will occur in the horizontal section of the wellbore, possibly resulting in wildly unstable variations in fluid production rate. Even with hydraulic fracturing, the effective productivity index (PI) is low by conventional well standards, resulting in low reservoir fluid influx rates per foot of horizontal section. At the same time, the mechanical requirements of horizontal well drilling and hydraulic fracturing techniques require horizontal section liners of at least 4 in to 6 in. As a result, fluid velocities in the horizontal section are generally quite low, resulting in a stratified vapor-liquid flow in the horizontal section. This stratified flow produces a large, fairly stagnant, gas volume that can drive strong terrain slugging in the vertical section of the well through periodic gas accumulation and blow out. This vigorous, terrain-induced, slugging is an inherently transient process that depends on the details of wellbore geometry, reservoir fluid properties, reservoir pressure, completion and perforation details, production rate, and multiphase fluid dynamics. As a result, wellbore instability can be predicted only through a transient multiphase flow simulation. In addition, such a simulation suggests techniques for the suppression of the potentially severe fluctuations of well production rates.

AB  - ABSTRACT Drilling with a bottomhole pressure less than the formation pore pressure (Underbalanced Drilling, UBD) usually increase the risk of borehole instability due to yielding or failure of the rock adjacent to the borehole. But evaluation criterion of this failure mechanism is complex and very often diagnosis did not fit with field operational practices. It is believed that, shear and radial tensile failures with negligible chemical instability are the common mechanisms to cause mechanical instability in UBD in shales. In a mechanical borehole instability perspective, UBD causes lots of potential challenges and formation uncertainities due to facts like:         - Insufficient case data related to borehole instability;         - Complex physics of borehole instability mechanisms ;         - Requirement to conduct excessive experimental work which is costly and time consuming;         - Scarcity of real shales specimen and reluctant for coring of shales;         - Reliability of fitting material constitutive model to analyse shales;         - Dependable model to predict wellbore collapse pressure;         - Uncertainty to predict pore pressure and permeability of shale formation;         - Variable pressure regimes (i.e., shale heterogeneity); A detailed workflow in connection within physical, experimental, analytical and numerical investigation is required to understand and to diagnose borehole stability. Numerous studies have been carried out so far on borehole stability design, but UBD and shale instability is quite new research areas where more insight is needed. This paper discuss and presents mechanical borehole instability both analytically and numerically to quantify borehole collapse risk for inclined wells. In addition produce comparable results and therefore some physical models are also presented for in depth study. Results show that the analytical and numerical models competent to predict borehole collapse risk in terms of minimum mud weight window. Since several real- life situations were evaluated, the potential applicability of the models is apparent; the results could be used as cross checks for particular situations in the field. The generality of this study provided an overview along with standard workflow into borehole collapse assessment which may helps to obtain proper diagnosis of material failure state with respect to reduction of instability in drilling. Findings of this study can be useful for further research within the same area. KEYWORDS: UBD, shales, mechanical instability, collapse pressure, pore pressure and mud weight window.

AB  - Abstract This paper presents field data that show how continuous gas lift instability is manifested. It also reviews former proposed criteria to predict the phenomenon. The best available criteria are selected and expanded to take into account different flow regimes for the surface gas injection valve and the bottomhole gas-lift valve. The expanded criteria are examined using field data. The criteria clearly show the relative importance of the different factors involved, and thereby help to assure stable flow conditions at the design phase or to decide what actions to take in order to stabilize an unstable gas lift well. Introduction Unstable operational conditions may occur in a continuous gas-lift well because the characteristics of the system are such that small perturbations can degenerate into huge oscillations in the flow parameters. Grupping et al. were the first to describe the mechanisms by which these unstable conditions are generated. In many wells, the operating gas-lift valve is simply an orifice valve and operates in the subcritical flow regime. Under these conditions, if for some unpredictable reason the bottomhole pressure decreases a little, the gas flow rate through the gas-lift valve may increase and cause a further decrease in the tubing flowing pressure. A snowball effect may then occur, with a substantial amount of gas being blown through the tubing. If some gas injection control exists at the surface, then the casing pressure will decrease rapidly. Eventually, the gas flow rate through the gas-lift valve will decrease, causing the tubing flowing pressure and the casing pressure to increase further. Thus, both tubing flowing pressure and gas injection pressure oscillations are observed at the surface. Figure 1 shows production records for a well at Prudhoe Bay, Alaska in which these pressure cycles are clearly displayed. Operating a well under these cycling conditions has several disadvantages. First, the pressure surges in the production facilities may be so huge that severe operational problems, such as compressor shutdown, are likely to occur. Second, the full lift potential of the gas is not used, resulting in very inefficient operation. Third, production control and allocation becomes very difficult, because reliable measurements of the production rates when testing these wells cannot be obtained. These unstable operating conditions should be avoided to be cost effective. Preferably, the operating stability should be guaranteed at the design phase. For this, accurate stability criteria are necessary. In the following sections, the existing stability criteria are reviewed and their corresponding strengths and weaknesses are discussed. Finally, a unified approach is suggested. P. 401^

AB  - Abstract Drilling activities have progressed to deep and ultra deep seas in recent times and with it comes more challenges. Due to the difficulty of directly obtaining important parameters like in-situ stress and fracture gradient, simple models have been evolved. This study is a novel attempt to make up for the gap inherent in such models namely that they neglect chemical and thermal effects, settling for only effective stress and a time-dependent analysis. The study applied the Neural Network (NN) technology to predict geomechanical parameters. Neural Network (NN) as a branch of Artificial intelligence (AI) possesses the ability of training available parameters to replace data that cannot be immediately or easily acquired. Data of a well drilled in the Niger Delta Region of Nigeria was used as the case study. A training set of input data was used to train the network and a validation set ensured a completely independent measure of network accuracy. A Neural Network model was developed in Neuroph Studio, Java neural network platform and the Netbeans IDE. The model has the advantage of being easy to use, open source, cross-platform and generally designed to save the cost associated with wellbore instability.

However, high air-flow rates and gas generation at the combustion front can be stabilizing influences. For unstable operation, an estimate of the size of the reverse combustion channel may be obtained from the curve for the most highly amplified wave length. This provides a method for calculating the air flux, combustion front velocity, and rate of progress of the burn front.Recently the U.S. DOE Laramie Energy Technology Center (LETC) and Sandia Laboratories obtained experimental data about reverse combustion from a field test of in-situ coal gasification at Hanna, WY. These data show that 9.7 days were required for the development of a reverse combustion path 68 to 70 ft in length. The stability theory developed in this work predicts a length of 64 ft for this same 9.7-day period. In addition to quantitative predictions, stability theory provides an explanation of certain puzzling qualitative observations concerning reverse combustion.IntroductionIn-situ combustion is a potentially useful method for recovering fossil fuels from underground deposits. A number of in-situ combustion field tests have been conducted in oil reservoirs, tar sands, oil shale deposits, and coal seams. In-situ combustion can be classified into two broad categories: reverse combustion, in which the reaction front travels countercurrent to the flow of air, and forward combustion, in which the reaction zone travels in the same direction as the flow of air.Reverse combustion is especially important for coal and tar sands. During forward combustion, tars vaporized at the flame front in either coal or tar sands travel by convection into cooler regions ahead of the reaction zone where they condense and subsequently reduce the natural permeability of the fuel bed.In reverse combustion, vaporized tars or other high-molecular-weight compounds generated in the reaction zone travel toward the production well through a heated area already contacted by the high temperatures of the combustion front. As an added advantage, reverse combustion in tar sands substantially increases the relative permeability to gas. In lignite and subbituminous coal, drying and partial combustion typically increase the effective permeability to gas by four orders of magnitude. However, bituminous coal frequently swells on heating, and the net effect of reverse combustion on the permeability of swelling coals has not been investigated thoroughly. In coal and tar sands, reverse combustion is primarily a coking or carbonization process - i.e., the volatile components of the tar or coal are partially combusted while most of the carbon or coke is left unburned.For these reasons, reverse combustion represents an important part of some in-situ combustion methods currently being investigated for tar sands and coal. In the linked vertical well process for in-situ coal gasification, reverse combustion is used first to develop a high-permeability path between the production and air injection wells, while in the second stage of the process forward gasification or combustion is used as the major gas production method. Both industrial companies and government laboratories have investigated the linked vertical well process. For tar sands, the LETC is considering the use of reverse combustion as a preparatory mechanism similar to that used in coal.

AB  - AbstractNatures of Nahr Umr shale instability problems in Zakum field are studied in Geomechanical and chemical views. Literatures, past drilling data, wireline logging and well test data, and analysis of cuttings and cores are studied to define the cause of the problem and find the way to fix it.By using the record of past drilling troubles, problems are likely in the highly deviated well, and relationship between drilling direction and trouble occurrence is not clear. It has obvious relationship with mud weight and chemicals, however the causality is not clear.The Geomechanical model was set for the formation from the analyzed data, available literatures and measured data in the recently drilled well. Also, mechanical and chemical characteristics of the shale are examined with cuttings recovered from wells, and cores from past wells.Mineralogical test are mechanical strength measurements are performed for the samples. Observation and testing of the samples unveil the fact that the shale has severe anisotropic feature of the mechanical strength and physical feature such as permeability.By integrating the facts and findings, the authors determine the failure mode as bedding plane failure caused by its anisotropic feature and pressure penetration. Counter measures are proposed based on the numerical studies of poro-elastic and discontinuous modeling.IntroductionNahr Umr formation constitutes the cap rock of Thamama formation, the main reservoir of Upper Zakum field. The shale formation spread widely in the southern part of Arabian Gulf, and hole instability problems occurred in the shale is one of the key interests for the oil industry in the Middle East. However, nature of the rock varies place-by-place, and depthby- depth, the troubles we encounter are unique for each field, and we do not expect any single solution to overcome them.Recent development of Geomechanics and Rock Mechanics approaches for wellbore instability issue gives opportunity to find solutions of such problems. However, the shale instability is complicated phenomenon, and integration of the knowledge and expertise are required. (Fadaq and Tantawi, 2000). In the real situation, available data is limited, nature of the rock failure is far complicated than simplified mechanical models, and many elements are involved in the phenomena. Furthermore, the controllable factors for drilling engineers are limited. Thus, we should carefully watch the nature, and continuously improve the understanding of it.ZADCO (Zakum Development Company), JODCO (Japan Oil Development Corporation) and JNOC (Japan National Oil Corporation) have jointly studied the nature and counter measures of the shale troubles. In this paper, we show available information about failure modes of the shale, and model the mechanical failures.Scheme of the studyThe scheme of the study is summarized in Fig. 1. Available data for us is past drilling trouble reports (morning reports and documents), rock samples (cores and cuttings), electrical logging, and knowledge and experiences of engineers.Since a shale section is not an interest of production, rock samples and logging data is limited. Furthermore, critical hole conditions in the shale prevent us to gather new data. In the past two years, we have collected information available in Nahr Umr formation in Upper Zakum field with the cooperation of managements, geologists, and drilling engineers and crews, and looked over them. Chemical and mechanical information of the formation rock are collected.Geomechanical condition is tentatively set up, and failure mechanism is anticipated. Both of them should be corrected and improved through the implementation of proposed counter measures, and monitoring.

AB  - ABSTRACTFluid flow effects on bluff structures include higher drag resistance as well as vortex resonance and galloping type of instabilities. Vibrations of tall structures such as buildings, bridges, chimneys, offshore platforms, marine risers and a wide variety of other configurations have been of interest to engineers and scientists. Recent advances in the material science and computer aided design has led to structures with reduced stiffness making them prone to wind, earthquake, as well as ocean waves and current excited oscillations. A structural member with square crosB-section is frequently encountered in such civil, mechanical and ocean engineering applications. The present study assesses effectivenss of the Moving Surface Boundary-layer Control (MSBC) with reference to drag reduction and vibration suppression of a two-dimensional square prism. To begin with the effects of the momentum injection parameter Uc/U (Uc, cylinder surface velocity; U, freestream velocity) and angle of attack on the surface pressure distribution, resultant forces and wake characteristics are evaluated using an organized wind tunnel static test investigation. Next, dynamic studies are undertaken to assess its effectiveness in suppressing both vortex resonance and galloping type of instabilities. Finally, the wind tunnel test results are complemented by an extensive flow visualization study. The results suggest that the boundarylayer control through momentum injection can significantly reduce drag and effectively control flow induced instabilities. INTRODUCTIONThe phenomena of flow separation and the associated turbulent vortex wake is the most characteristic feature of an incompressible flow past a bluff body over a wide range of Reynolds numbers (1 ≤ Re ≤ 107). At the point of separation the thickness of the shear layer abruptly changes from O(Re-1/2) upstream to O(1) downstream in case of laminar separation (Brown and Stewartson, 1969). The recirculating region downstream of the body alters the effective body shape and hence the inviscid flow around it. Such a bluff body experiences very high drag due to the low pressure in the wake.

AB  - A theoretical method is derived for predicting trim angle and speed coefficient at the inception of propoising of prismatic planing hulls. Although equations are derived for the surge, pitch, and heave degrees of freedom, it is seen that the effect of surge is small at ordinary operating trim angles. Comparisons of theoretical predictions with existing experimental data on coupled pitch and heave porpoising show reasonably good agreement for a wide range of speed coefficients, load coefficients, and deadrise angles. The theory may also be used for estimating the natural frequencies and damping characteristics of prismatic hulls in the stable, high-speed planing range.

AB  - ABSTRACTThe on-bottom stability of a submarine pipeline is a flow-pipe-soil coupling problem. For the integrated pipe-soil system under the action of steady current, two correlated instability modes could be involved, i.e., the lateral-instability of the pipeline and the tunnel-erosion of the underlying soil. In the previous studies, the aforementioned two instability modes were investigated separately. In this paper, a finite element (FE) model for the flow-seepage-elastoplasticity sequential coupling is established to reveal the multi-physics coupling effects of such integrated system. This numerical model can realize the simultaneous and coupled simulation of the flow field over the partially-embedded pipe, the seepage-flow field and the elastoplastic stress-strain field of the soil. The proposed model is compared and well verified with the existing experimental results. Numerical simulation shows that both the non-uniform pressure distribution together with the viscous stress along the pipe periphery and the pressure-drop along the seabed are formed synchronously due to the existence of the pipe. The former will generate the hydrodynamic forces on the pipe, which may trigger the lateral-instability; while the latter will induce seepage flow in the underlying soil, which may result in the occurrence of tunnel-erosion. Numerical results also indicate that not only the hydrodynamic forces but the maximum upward hydraulic gradient increase nonlinearly with increasing inflow velocity. Instability mode and mechanism for the pipe-soil coupling system can be finally determined with the instability criteria.INTRODUCTIONAs the offshore exploitation of gas and oil moves into deeper waters, the on bottom instability of a submarine pipeline induced by ocean currents becomes one of the main causes for the structural failure (see Drumond et al, 2018). For such a flow-pipe-soil interaction issue, two physical processes within the integrated pipe-soil system, i.e. lateral-instability of the pipe and tunnel-erosion of the underlying soil, are involved. The physical mechanisms and criteria for the two different instability modes have been explored intensively in previous studies (e.g., Fredsø e, 2016; Zhang et al., 2016; Gao, 2017; Drumond et al, 2018).In ocean currents, the flow over a pipeline and the seepage-flow within the underlying soil can be generated synchronously. On the one hand, when the lateral soil resistance provided by seabed soil is insufficient to balance the hydrodynamic forces exerted on the pipeline by the flow, the pipeline would breakout laterally from its original position. On the other hand, if soil seepage failure due to the pressure drop between the upstream and downstream of a partially-embedded pipeline is triggered, the tunnel-erosion underneath the pipeline will be initiated immediately (see Chiew, 1990; Sumer et al. 2001; Yang et al., 2014). Note that, the lateral-instability of pipeline and the tunnel-erosion of soil were always investigated separately. Moreover, in the tunnel-erosion numerical simulation, the pipeline was often set as a fixed rigid boundary with assumption of a rigid and permeable seabed (e.g., Zang et al., 2009); and in the lateral-instability studies, the elasto-plastic behaviors of soil and the interfacial characteristics for the pipe-soil interaction were the main focus of attention (e.g., Gao, et al., 2012; Bai et al., 2015).

AB  - ABSTRACT:Many of the transient models used to simulate gas and liquid pipelines are based on the method of finite differences (FD). FD models represent continuous model properties like pressure, flow rate, and temperature on a discrete grid of points in space and time, thereby approximating the true continuous partial differential equations (PDEs) governing fluid flow as a finite set of algebraic equations. This approach can be efficient and accurate but is subject to numerical instability and a host of other numerical problems if the grids aren’t chosen appropriately. This article explores the situations in which these problems arise, how to diagnose them, and and what can be done about them. Explicit, fully implicit, and partially implicit FD models are examined. Recommendations for model building and model use are developed based on the results of a variety of test scenarios. INTRODUCTIONAll computer pipeline models embody some or all of a set of differential equations representing conservation of mass, momentum, energy, and possibly species and some other quantities. While a solution of the underlying PDEs is guaranteed to represent what would actually happen in the pipeline, the conversion of them into algebraic equations brings in the additional possibility of numerical errors: even if the PDEs were right, the solution might still be wrong. For the purposes of this paper we will consider only the conservation of mass, momentum, and energy PDEs. These are the required equations to make a pipeline model that solves for the pressure, temperature, and flow rate everywhere in the pipe system as a function of location and time. Just these three PDEs provide several distinct opportunities for the introduction of serious numerical errors into the solution. The process of converting a set of PDEs on paper to a FD solution scheme is known as "discretization".

AB  - AbstractWhile oil-base muds have given satisfactory performance in the past, environmental concerns performance in the past, environmental concerns motivate the further development of water-base muds. Often associated with water-base muds are operational problems such as bit balling, high torque, and stuck problems such as bit balling, high torque, and stuck pipe. Tests commonly used to evaluate muds are pipe. Tests commonly used to evaluate muds are typically conducted on nonpreserved, unstressed shale and disparate formations. There is a need, therefore, for means of evaluating non-oil mud systems in the laboratory to predict relative performance under field conditions. This paper describes two methods of testing water-base muds on preserved, stressed shale specimens. One test method utilizes the Microbit Drilling Rig (MDR) to study bit balling characteristics of shale in a given mud system. The test results showed that the clay matrix of the rock can influence balling. The type of cations present are critical, whereas cation exchange capacity present are critical, whereas cation exchange capacity and moisture content are not directly correlatable to bit balling. Analysis of the rock to determine composition and plasticity can be used to determine the tendency of a given formation to ball the bit. The second method utilizes the Downhole Simulation Cell (DSC) to study wellbore instability resulting from exposure of shale to drilling muds under downhole temperature and stress conditions. An elasto-plastic model is presented showing how mud type can affect wellbore stability. These results caution against reliance on tests of unconfined shale particles (cuttings) or even unconsolidated shale specimens when studying effects of muds on shale instability. Tests results from the MDR and DSC test equipment can be used to develop data bases for the selection of mud system and bit type and to suggest hydraulics to prevent balling of PDC bits. The data has been applied prevent balling of PDC bits. The data has been applied to the selection of a water-base mud that reduced both mud and operation costs when drilling deviated wells in the Gulf of Mexico. IntroductionIn previously reported investigations, bit balling has been explained in terms of mechanical and chemical factors. Mechanical explanations relate balling to differential sticking of the cuttings to the cutter due to the difficulty in getting fluid between the cutter and the cutting and to differential sticking due to dilatancy in the shear zone of the cutting causing a drop in cutting pore pressure. Chemical explanations relate balling to the tendency of the drilling fluid to wet the surface of the bit, allowing the cutting to stick, differential sticking of the cuttings due to swelling as hydrophilic cuttings attempt to imbibe water, and the reactivity of the clay as measured by its Cation Exchange Capacity (CEC). These chemical theories imply that shales should ball badly if they have (1) high CEC, (2) small particle size, (3) large surface area, and (4) high smectite content, especially sodium smectite.

AB  - ABSTRACT:Laboratory experiments were conducted to elucidate the mechanisms of liquid-liquid jet break-up over the laminar to turbulent jet flow regimes and to obtain droplet size spectra for model development and validation. Crude oils and silicone fluid were injected at atmospheric pressure, and liquid CO2 INTRODUCTION Liquid-liquid jet instability and breakup into a dispersed phase are important phenomena that have significant implications related to a host of marine applications and events such as underwater oil well blowout and sequestration of CO2 in the deep ocean to mitigate greenhouse gas emissions into the atmosphere. Modeling the fate of liquid contaminant discharges into the ocean requires accurate information of the size distribution of the dispersed contaminant phase. To date, the majority of investigations of jet break-up have focused on liquid-gas systems. The results of these studies may not be directly applicable to liquid-liquid systems. Studies of liquid-liquid jet break-up have, for the most part, examined laminar jet flows at low velocities. In order to secure a better understanding of the instability and breakup of transitional and turbulent liquid jets discharging into another liquid, laboratory experiments were conducted in which crude oils, silicone fluid and liquid CO2 were injected into water under different conditions and studied using video flow imaging and quantitative droplet size measurements.was injected under simulated deep ocean conditions, into water through a variety of orifices over a range of velocities. Break-up phenomena were documented with a video imaging system. Quantitative droplet size spectra were obtained with a Phase Doppler Particle Analyzer and video image analysis. Five modes of instabilities were identified which suggest a progression of instabilities resulting in droplet generation moving initially from the jet core filament to the jet surface. Boundaries between the different instability regimes in dimensionless space were established based on the present data.

AB  - ABSTRACT: This paper examines the problem of translational slope instabilities occurring in complex geological formations of weak rock as are typical of the Langhe region in Italy. Unstable rock volumes slide along slightly dipping planar surfaces that are formed where adjacent layers of marl and sand are in contact. Four sites were identified and examined. Special attention was devoted to the development of a laboratory method able to simulate the behaviour of the thin layer of marl which is deemed to play an active role in these phenomena in conjunction with the sand layers providing a preferential path for groundwater circulation. Direct shear tests were carried out and the results obtained show that the fundamental role played in instability phenomena by the de-structuring effect of water on marl cannot be taken into account through the customary laboratory techniques.

AB  - AbstractConsiderable amount of resources are spent by the petroleum industry on laboratory measurements of relative permeability. The technique used in most of these measurements is based on the interpretation of core displacement results, i. e. the unsteady-state method. Often core displacements for relative permeability tests are carried out at high flow rates and involve unfavorable mobility ratios. Although it is well known that such displacements can suffer from viscous instabilities, usually little or no attention is paid to the consequences of such instabilities. This may be one of the reasons why laboratory-measured relative permeability data are often found to be unreliable in reservoir simulation studies. It is, therefore, important to understand how viscous instabilities affect the measurements of relative permeability.The objective of this study was to experimentally determine the relationship between the extent of viscous instability and the measured relative permeability. Oil displacement experiments were carried out in a triaxially confined core packed with silica sand. The extent of viscous instability was varied by using mineral oils of different viscosities as well as by using different flow rates. Relative permeabilities were calculated by using both a history-matching technique and an explicit technique similar to the JBN method.Results of this study show that the two techniques of calculating relative permeabilities from unsteady-state displacement data provide essentially similar results, and that viscous instability affects relative permeability measurements significantly. Further, this study demonstrates that breakthrough recovery, end-point water permeability and residual oil saturation are co relatable with a dimensionless number characterizing the extent of viscous instability.IntroductionThe importance of reliable relative permeability data in reservoir engineering studies is well recognized in the petroleum industry. Such data are often obtained by using either steady-state or unsteady-state methods. Because a long time is needed to obtain a single relative permeability curve when using the steady-state method, the unsteady-state method, also referred to as the external-drive method, is often preferred in laboratory studies as it facilitates a much faster data acquisition process. Moreover, the unsteady-state method is applicable to displacements where saturation gradients exist, while the steady-state method is not. As a consequence, the difference between relative permeabilities estimated by using the two methods can be significant for the same sand-fluid system [l,2].Use of the unsteady-state method is limited to displacements in which the assumptions underlying the Buckley-Leverett theory are met [3]. This implies that the displacement used for measuring relative permeabilitles must be stabilized and strictly one-dimensional so that the pressure and saturation are uniform in any cross-section[4]. Therefore, ideally, the unsteady-state method is applicable only when the displacement is both stable and stabilized[5].Usually, one of the two approaches -- explicit or implicit is taken to estimate relative permeabilities from laboratory displacement data. The implicit approach is advantageous when the displacement is unstabilized and/or the end-point mobility ratio is near one [6,7,8,9]. In this approach. a reservoir simulator is used and the differentiation of laboratory data is not required.

AB  - Abstract Low tension polymer flooding (LTPF) can be considered as an alternative enhanced oil recovery method for some heavy oil reservoirs where thermal and miscible gas-injection methods face technical and environmental challenges. To properly tailor LTPF to a heavy oil reservoir, it should be optimized via simulation in the lab, pilot, and field scales. However, simulation normally suffers from the paucity of detailed knowledge of viscous instability or fingering effects, due to displacing a more viscous fluid by a less viscous one. This instability reduces displacement efficiency and may invalidate usual method of simulating LTPF performance based on relative permeability and capillary pressure concepts. Also, it introduces an additional scaling requirement for using results of experiments in larger scales. Thus, predicting instability nature is of particular concern, to avoid viscous fingering, or, where it is inevitable, to be capable to include it as an additional factor in modeling displacement. Major limitations of previous approaches for studying viscous fingering in immiscible displacements are that reported experiments have been conducted utilizing linear displacements schemes in media with high, single-phase permeabilities. Consequently, the questions that arise are whether previous findings can be valid in low-permeability media and using displacement schemes similar to the oil-field patterns (e.g., five-spot). In oil-field patterns, one has to deal with varying velocity profiles from injector(s) to producer(s). Because velocity is one controlling factor in viscous fingering, the effect of dispersion caused by varying velocity profiles has not been tested completely on viscous fingering in previous experimental studies. To help understand viscous fingering in LTPF in heavy oil reservoirs and to overcome the limitations of previous studies, we conducted experiments in low-permeability, one-quarter, five-spot patterns. New insights into the main driving mechanisms for viscous fingering are proposed. In summary, the mechanisms of spreading, splitting, coalescence, and microscopic crossflow drive the finger growth. In addition, the viscous fingers are readily initiated in the porous medium, but they can be damped out before traveling very far. This damping of the viscous fingers is due to the flow of the two phases in a direction transverse to the direction of bulk fluid movement (along the mean free path) as a result of dispersive processes such as stream splitting. Also, the initially-developed fingers may deteriorate over the time of displacement. This depends on the distance between the injector and producer and width of the porous medium. The presence of instabilities that look like fingers and stable displacements behind the unstable front were discovered. The results also indicate that a stable zone exists and progresses throughout the porous medium at varying velocities. This was the reason for considerable ultimate recovery observed after breakthrough where numerous pore volumes were injected. Finally, we reveal three different types of displacements that occurred: stable displacements, displacement with macroscopic viscous fingering, and displacements with both macroscopic and microscopic viscous fingering. Therefore, in LTPF, macroscopic and microscopic fingering exist and flow theory must include both to match the experimental results. Additionally, the differences between microscopic and macroscopic fingering has not been incorporated in available reservoir simulations. Hence, these two phenomena need to be modeled in simulations.

AB  - Abstract Asphaltenes are the n-pentane or n-heptane insoluble fractions of crude oil that remain in solution under reservoir temperature and pressure conditions. They are destabilized and start to precipitate when the pressure, temperature, and/or composition changes occur during primary production. The precipitated asphaltene particles will then grow in size, and may start to deposit onto the production string and/or flowlines, causing operational problems.In this paper, our emphasis is to identify the first pressure and/or temperature conditions at which the asphaltene will start to precipitate for two reservoir oils. Four different laboratory techniques were independently used to define the onset of the asphaltene precipitation envelope. These methods are: 1) gravimetric; 2) acoustic resonance; 3) light scattering; and 4) filtration. The gravimetric method was found to be precise, and within the accuracy of the analytical methods. However, the method was time consuming. The acoustic resonance technique (ART) was fast and less subjective, but it did not define the lower asphaltene boundary. The interpretation of the onset pressure from the near-infrared (NIR) light-scattering technique (LST) was subjective to a degree. However, the NIR response defined the upper and lower boundaries of the asphaltene envelope and the bubblepoint pressure, as did the gravimetric technique. In a manner similar to those of the gravimetric technique and LST, the filtration technique can also define the upper and lower asphaltene phase boundaries, in addition to the bubblepoint pressure. The filtration technique is fast compared to the gravimetric technique, but takes more time than the ART and LST methods.IntroductionAsphaltenes remain in solution under reservoir temperature and pressure conditions. They start to precipitate when the stability of the colloidal dispersion is disturbed. This disturbance can be caused by changes in pressure, temperature, and/or composition of the oil.Precipitation and deposition of asphaltenes have reportedly caused operational problems, ranging from plugging of tubulars and flowlines(1-3) to clogging of production separators(4). Leontaritis and Mansoori present a comprehensive description of field problems caused by asphaltene deposition(5). Figure 1 schematically presents the asphaltene-related problems that may occur in the field. Asphaltene precipitation problems can be categorized as follows:Precipitation can be caused by the changes in temperature and/or pressure during primary depletion..Precipitation can be caused by blending or commingling of two noncompatible reservoir fluid streams (i.e., subsea completions), acid stimulation and/or enhanced recovery injection gases (CO2, H2S, or rich gas).The correct operating procedure to minimize the asphaltene problem is not well understood. We believe a better understanding of the fundamental processes leading to solids precipitation is a prerequisite to management and prevention of production problems.Primarily, two theoretical approaches have been presented in the literature to compute phase separations of asphaltene during primary production. These approaches include association modeling( 6, 7) and calculation of asphaltene solubility parameters with the Flory Huggins polymer phase separation technique.(8, 9) Asphaltene destabilization caused by solvent injection and consequent alteration of the rock surface wettability have also been reported in the literature, but are not discussed here.(10).

AB  - This study presents a unified transient model that can be used as a tool to predict different transient multiphase flow phenomena in petroleum production and transportation through wells and pipelines. These transient behaviors such as production rate change, sudden perturbation of steady state flow or cyclic flow behavior are predicted and analyzed. For cyclic flow behaviors, the casing heading instability that occurs in gas-lift operations are investigated. The development of the model is based on mass and momentum conservation equations. A transient heat transfer model is also developed to estimate the temperature profile along the production system. The black oilmodel is added to calculate the fluid properties at each time step.Several methods were developed in the past to predict flow instabilities. However, they are designed for specific transient behavior and they can only predict whether or not the flow is unstable. They cannot quantify how unstable it will be. The present model can predict the detailed multiphase flow hydrodynamic behaviors including pressure, temperature, local flow pattern, liquid holdup, and fluid velocities. The model is validated through comparisons with experimental results and field data.

AB  - AbstractThis study focuses on analyzing thermal effects produced by plasma torch on rock physical parameters, designed to assist operations during geothermal well drilling. Plasma torch can interact with samples and reduce rock strength. In the presented theoretical model it is noticed that elasticity modulus (Young’s modulus) and temperatures play important roles in thermal stress distribution. The results show that at 4500°C with 6MPa compressive loading elasticity modulus is the best situation for wellbore instability. By contrast, at 1500°C with a loading of 38MPa elasticity modulus is a suitable result for stability of the borehole. In experimental work it is found that 7 to 10 seconds plasma torch traction with cylindrical specimen rock samples can generate thermal fractures. Elasticity modulus of all granite and limestone samples was sharply dropped after 10 seconds of plasma torch interaction with each dry rock sample on account of the fact that visible cracks generate on the surface.1. INTRODUCTIONIn recent years, problems associated with drilling oil and gas wells around large urban settlements have become a major limitation to underground drilling, particularly in relation to environmental damages in highly populated or industrialized areas. Therefore, the development of underground drilling mechanisms is of high priority [1- 6]. Hard-rock drilling is an expensive process because the drill string machines and bottom hole assembly must be extremely rugged and powerful to overcome the intact hard rocks [3-10]. We present a method to assist improving hard rock drilling machines, which is achieved by developing techniques to weaken the rock before it is mechanically removed [9-12]. This is obtained by generating uniform holes inside of rock textures during drilling and perforation operation [10- 13]. Recently it has been reported that making of holes inside the intact rocks may not be a suitable method [9- 12]. It is proposed that a proper method to change the hard rock into a loss rock can be achieved by generating fractures into the rock texture [10-13]. The fractures can be generated by generating a high temperature gradient within the rock. Temperature increase causes expansion and eventually breakdown. One way to induce a proper temperature gradient is by using the plasma torch in order to assist the drilling operation. During thermally assisted drilling operation fractures are generated inside of the wellbore and this can reduce the wall strength considerably [19-20]. A plasma arc torch can generate that temperature into the rock and material texture [30- 34].

AB  - Abstract As hydrocarbon exploration and development moves into deeper water and onshore arctic environments, it becomes increasingly important to quantify the drilling hazards posed by gas hydrates. To address these concerns, a 1D semi-analytical model for heat and fluid transport in the reservoir was coupled with a numerical model for temperature distribution along the wellbore. This combination allowed the estimation of the dimensions of the hydrate-bearing layer where the initial pressure and temperature can dynamically change while drilling. These dimensions were then used to build a numerical reservoir model for the simulation of the dissociation of gas hydrate in the layer. The bottomhole pressure (BHP) and formation properties used in this workflow were based on a real field case. The results provide an understanding of the effects of drilling through hydrate-bearing sediments and of the impact of drilling fluid temperature and BHP on changes in temperature and pore pressure within the surrounding sediments. It was found that the amount of gas hydrate that can dissociate will depend significantly on both initial formation characteristics and bottomhole conditions, namely mud temperature and pressure. The procedure outlined in the paper can provide quantitative results of the impact of hydrate dissociation on wellbore stability, which can help better design drilling muds for ultra deep water operations. Introduction Natural gas hydrates are ice-like deposits, containing a mixture of water and gas with methane as a primary gas, which are stable under high pressure and low temperatures and found in deepwater settings at relatively shallow depths below the seafloor and in permafrost regions (Sloan, 1998). Reduction in pressure or increase in temperature, as well as use of inhibitors, causes dissociation of gas hydrates. When hydrate-bearing sediments (HBS) are drilled through, a change in pressure and temperature of the sediments may destabilize the hydrates. Usually, hydrates are found in shallow sediments above the surface casing point and are drilled through before the blowout preventer is installed. Under certain conditions, hydrate dissociation in the formation can lead to problems with wellbore stability and interference with seabed installations, and adversely impact on the efficiency and safety of drilling operations. There are two main problems associated with gas hydrates dissociation that may lead to wellbore instability: a)  Dissociation in the wellbore may result in gasification of the drilling fluid, which leads to the lowering of the mud density and changes mud rheology, lowering hydrostatic pressure and further dissociation. This may lead to hole enlargement and wellbore collapse. b)  Dissociation in the HBS may result in change of mechanical and petrophysical properties of the sediments such as increase in permeability and reduction in strength of the sediments. Prediction and risk assessment of the hazards described above may be achieved by the use of a numerical mechanical-thermal-chemical stability modeling tool that incorporates time-dependency.

AB  - American Institute of Mining, Metallurgical, and Petroleum Engineers, Inc. Abstract Spontaneous emulsification at liquid-liquid interfaces and Haines' jump phenomenon at liquid-gas interfaces may be explained in terms of classical fluid mechanics, mass and energy diffusion and surface thermodynamics. These phenomena are examined in this paper in terns of an interaction between Marangoni effects and capillary forces. Marangoni effects refer to the motion of an interface due to gradients in interfacial tension. The porous medium used to study these effects is described geometrically as an interconnected network of converging-diverging channels. The flow of two immiscible fluids in these channels is described by the Navier-Stokes equations at very low Reynolds numbers. Differences in the potential (temperature and/or concentration) of potential (temperature and/or concentration) of these fluid phases will induce mechanical movement of the interface. The resultant unsteady motion is modelled as a classical Rayleigh flow or suddenly accelerated plane flow. This motion will initiate disruption plane flow. This motion will initiate disruption of the interface if the pressure drop due to shear forces is greater than the pressure drop due to normal forces. Analytical expressions developed in this work suggest parametric dependence of interfacial unstabilities in porous media on (i) differences in the kinematic and absolute viscosity (ii) the magnitude and direction of the interfacial tension gradient due to temperature and/or concentration differences (iii) absolute magnitude of the interfacial tension (iv) wettability of the porous matrix and (v) a geometric factor which is porous matrix and (v) a geometric factor which is characteristic of the microscopic structure of the porous medium. The influence of these parameters is supported by experimental data from the parameters is supported by experimental data from the literature. Introduction Additional chemical and/or thermal energy is required to overcome the capillary forces which entrap large quantities of residual oil in depleted petroleum reservoirs. Removal or reduction of interfacial forces with or without the reduction of viscous forces will allow the mobilization of isolated droplets and ganglias of oil and the subsequent formation of local regions of high oil saturation. The reservoir mechanics of tertiary floods will thus have to consider a microscopic mobilization efficiency in addition to the macroscopic displacement and areal sweep efficiencies. Physical and mathematical conceptions of the isolation and mobilization mechanisms will be necessary for the quantifying of microscopic efficiencies.

AB  - ABSTRACT: Optimization of drilling fluid parameters such as mud weight, salt concentration, and temperature is essential to alleviating instability problems when drilling through shale sections, particularly in hot environments. This paper describes the development of a solution for stress and pore pressure distribution around a borehole when considering significant thermal-and chemo-mechanical processes involved in shale-drilling fluid interactions. Phenomena related to thermal and chemical osmosis are included within the framework of linear thermoporoelasticity. The solution is one of generalized plane strain, therefore, it is suitable for investigating the impact of shale membrane characteristics, mud chemistry, and mud temperature on the stability of inclined well bores in shale. Application of the solution to a typical field operational situation has demonstrated that thermal osmosis can significantly impact fluid flux into the formation, thereby reducing stability. Also presented is new thermoporoelastic formulation for chemically-active rocks. Preliminary analysis suggests that mud temperature should be optimized in order to maximize the efficacy of chemical osmosis in stabilizing the borehole.

AB  - AbstractModel tests of two different types and two different scales were performed with test cylinders fitted with a freely-rotating riser fairing. At lower flow speeds, both tests showed the fairings to be effective in suppressing vortex-induced vibration (VIV) of the cylinder and in reducing drag. In both tests, however, large lateral cylinder oscillations developed once the flow exceeded a certain critical speed. Motion amplitudes in one test significantly exceeded those of a bare pipe undergoing VIV. A simple two-dimensional model of aircraft wing flutter was used to better understand the cause of the oscillations and to relate the onset of the motion to the fairing's specific design characteristics. The model predicted the observed threshold speeds with reasonable accuracy, suggesting that riser designers can borrow from existing aerodynamic flutter theory to ensure that riser fairings are designed to remain dynamically stable over the range of current speeds expected in service. Introduction and SummaryVIV of a bare riser is caused by flow separation and vortex shedding from alternate sides of the bluff circular riser crosssection. Riser fairings are sometimes used to streamline the flow and eliminate or reduce these effects. If separation and vortex formation are avoided, drag is reduced and the transverse excitation forces that lead to VIV are eliminated.Commonly, riser fairings are designed to rotate freely about the riser axis and to passively align with the direction of incident flow so they will effectively streamline the flow regardless of current direction. This rotational degree of freedom introduces the possibility of complex dynamic effects involving coupling between cross-flow translation and rotation.As part of a research program on riser VIV, ExxonMobil performed model tests of two different types to observe and measure the performance of segmented riser fairings intended to eliminate vortex-induced vibrations (VIV) and reduce mean drag. In one test, the freely rotating fairings were placed on a rigid spring-mounted cylinder that was towed horizontally at realistic riser Reynolds numbers. In the second test, a tensioned flexible brass pipe with a length of 9.63m and a diameter of 20mm was fitted with fairings with the same geometry, and tests were performed over a range of speeds in a configuration that simulates linearly sheared current flow.In both cases, the fairings reduced drag and suppressed VIV for low flow speeds. However, in both tests, large pipe lateral motions were observed for speeds exceeding a certain threshold. These motions appeared to involve a coupling between fairing rotation and pipe lateral vibration. In one test, motion amplitudes significantly exceeded those of a bare riser undergoing VIV, suggesting that the fairings could potentially cause damaging riser motions if exposed to current speeds beyond a critical threshold.To understand the phenomenon and the relationship between the threshold flow speed and fairing design characteristics, a simple theoretical model of aircraft wing flutter was used along with the physical characteristics of the fairing to compute threshold speeds for flutter onset.Calculated and observed threshold speeds agreed well, indicating that existing flutter analysis theory may provide riser designers with methods for ensuring that fairings are designed to remain dynamically stable over the range of current speeds expected in service.

AB  - ABSTRACT: This paper presents a comparative study used for the analysis of the stability of slopes of the Amiya area, near Kathgodam Nainital, Uttaranchal, based on assumptions that the rock mass follows the Mohr–Coulomb failure criterion. An extensive field study has been carried out. Laboratory experiments have been conducted to calculate the various mechanical properties of the rock mass. These properties have been used as input parameters for the numerical simulation. The computed finite element deformations and the stress distribution, along the failure surface, have been compared with the field measurements and are found to be in good agreement. The study shows that the slope is perilously unstable. 1 INTRODUCTION The stability of large rock slopes which are vulnerable to rock mass (rotational) failures can be analyzed by traditional limit equilibrium methods such as Bishop¡¯s method (Bishop 1955), Janbu¡¯s simplified method (Janbu 1954) or the later improved sophisticated method (Janbu 1957, Spencer 1967) based on assumptions regarding the inclination and location of the interslice forces. For many cases, the limit equilibrium methods established have given relatively reliable results despite their limitations. However, they tend to give conservative values of factor of safety, since the full shear strength is assumed to be mobilized simultaneously along the failure surface. Duncan (1996) and Griffiths & Lane (1999) summarized the results of a survey on slope stability analysis using FEM based on the shear strength reduction technique and provided a number of valuable lessons concerning the advantage and disadvantage of FEM for use in practical slope engineering problems. DEM (Cundall & Strack 1979) and discontinuous deformation analysis (DDA) (Chihsen & Bernard 1996) can be used to simulate large block movements in complex geological media consisting of many blocks which can break on presumed fracture planes during the calculation process without any external intervention.

AB  - Soon after introduction into service, a class of high-speed planing boats began to exhibit a dynamic instability that manifested itself in the craft trimming by the bow, rolling to a large angle of heel to port, and broaching violently to starboard, all within five seconds. This behavior, which occurred within the craft’s normal operating envelope, could not be attributed to operator causes and resulted in unacceptable operating restrictions being placed on the craft. After a number of unsuccessful attempts to remedy the problem, an investigation to research possible causes was undertaken. Concurrently, a test boat was instrumented to quantify its behavior and, most importantly, to record the hydrodynamic bottom pressures acting while this phenomenon occurs. The craft is described and initial attempts at solving the problem are outlined. The results of research on this type of phenomena in both planing craft and flying boats are presented. The instrumentation system, complex for this size craft, is detailed and the test procedure described. The results of the full-scale tests are given, along with qualitative comparisons with other craft that display a similar problem and model tests that would indicate the possibility of such instabilities. The cause of the instability is described and recommendations are made to avoid similar problems in future craft.

AB  - AbstractThis paper describes and illustrates a number of submarine canyons from various deepwater areas. It is based upon swathe bathymetry and geophysical field data acquired for geohazard site surveys and upon re-processed short offset 3D data. The morphology of these canyons is discussed, together with their potential for slope instability. These factors represent potential constraints to the continuing exploration and production activities in some deepwater areas.IntroductionSubmarine canyons have long been recognised as distinct channel features cutting into the majority of continental slope areas so far investigated1,2. As technology advances and mapping techniques improve, these canyons are being resolved in increasingly clearer detail. Particularly useful are deep towed long range sonar for covering large regional extents, whilst methods such as swathe bathymetry and short offset processed 3D seismic data can provide very detailed grids of seabed data. These latter two methods are providing unprecedented images over areas of typically a thousand square kilometres or more, at grid sizes of 25m by 25m and even to 12.5m by 12.5m.The association of these deep canyon systems with recent or present flow activity, such as turbidity currents, has long been recognised. Much has been published following indirect evidence concerning episodic events such as the 1929 Grand Banks and 1971 Nice/Var canyon related submarine cable breakages. As exploration and production continues in deep water, upper continental slope areas, these canyons are being encountered with increasing frequency. Thus, concerns are raised as to their stability combined with the present level of activity within the canyon systems3. Current research work is recognising the relatively recent nature of a number of events4. This is particularly important when, for example, sub-sea facilities are constrained by reservoir characteristics to being positioned close to, or within, such canyon systems.The new techniques mentioned above are progressively revealing much finer detail and will in time allow the frequency of minor flows to be better estimated.Improvements in visualisation and presentation of these results also allow a much more "user friendly" display, which should improve interpretation of actual processes involved.Three different areas are presented below to show how recent data sets are not only providing interesting views of submarine canyons, but can also add to the understanding of present day activity in these canyons. Also, the risk of slope instability for exploration and production operations in their vicinity may be better quantified.Offshore Nova ScotiaThis data set is from 3D seismic and covers an area of approximately 1500 sq km with a grid size of 25m by 25m. Water depths range from typically 200m on the shelf to 2475m in the deepest area to the southeast. It shows a complex tributary drainage pattern, (Figure 1). This is dominated by a single large-scale canyon, which has cut back into the continental shelf edge and then passes down the upper slope, continuing beyond the extent of the data set.

AB  - ABSTRACTSAFETOW (Strategic Aid For Escort and Salvage Tugs at Work) is a European project developed to provide masters of disabled vessels and masters of salvage and escort tugs with support tools which will enable them to make decisions in real-time with the best available information. This paper focuses on predicting the dynamics of a tug towing a disabled tanker. Of interest are the course stability, trajectories and time histories of trajectory parameters such as heading and drift angles. The calculation takes into account wind effects (using new generic equations), tow point, and towline length. Different fishtailing instabilities are also investigated, i.e. when tug and disabled tanker are both moving, and in bad weather conditions when tug is positionally fixed and the disabled tanker is weathervaning. For trajectory calculations, the velocity of the tug and the disabled tanker can be either constant or allowed to vary with respect to time. The authors also detail the new generic equations for estimating second order mean wave drift and current generic equations for current forces/moment.INTRODUCTIONBetween January 1992 and March 1999, a total of 593 merchant ships were lost. In many of these cases, if safe towing had been available, there is quite a good probability that the accident would have been avoided. For instance, in the AMOCO CADIZ accident, if action had been taken early enough to control the drift, this would have prevented the grounding of the ship and the spilling of 227,000 tons of crude oil, with a cost of about 282 million euros.Safety, reliability and economy are the main considerations in the design of salvage towing. In calm sea conditions, the tow rope force is a combination of the resistance of the vessel and forces associated with any motion oscillations.

AB  - AbstractThe mechanical properties of rocks are essential for analysis of different problems during oil and gas drilling and production and future development. These properties are required for borehole stability, sand production, and select optimum flow rate during the completion stage and many other problems related with the short and long term mechanical stability of the well and the reservoir. The correct predictions may help in saving millions of dollars in drilling and completions costs, and may allow preventing long term and costly consequences. A common problem in oil and gas industry is the unavailability of the real core samples. To overcome this problem the engineers struggle to develop alternative sources of data via correlations, log measurements, etc. In this study, a simple scratching cell was developed and data produced was used to develop a correlation for predicting the unconfined compressive strength (UCS) for Saudi Arabian rocks. The output of this paper is a great addition to the rock mechanics and petroleum engineering disciplines especially in Borehole instability problems during drilling of oil and gas wells.

AB  - ABSTRACTThe severe slugging flow instability in flowline-riser systems is an upstream compressibility problem, where trapped gas upstream the riser base can be compressed and eventually cause blow out of the accumulated liquid in the riser. For the case of a very long riser, flow instabilities can be induced by gas expansion in the riser itself. Even small amounts of trapped gas can cause flow instabilities, as the accumulated gas is flushed through the bend at the riser base and into the riser. Small scale air-water experiments have been carried out to illustrate this phenomenon in an 8m long vertical riser with an internal diameter of 16mm. Constant inlet pressure is obtained by an overflow arrangement for the liquid. The gas is injected in a small undulation upstream the riser base. Unstable production has been observed both for continuous and non-continuous liquid production at the outlet, and the experiments have successfully been simulated by a Lagrangian slug tracking code.

AB  - Abstract The frontal instabilities are a key control factor which can significantly affect the sweep efficiency and oil recovery in miscible flooding processes. Under unfavorable viscosity ratio between injection solvent and oil, the frontal instabilities are nearly unavoidable. However, how to suppress the instabilities, especially with low additional costs, should be carefully investigated. The present study examines the time-dependent displacement rates on flow instabilities in miscible flooding. Within the capacity of injection pumps, the injection rates are varied with time in a fast alternating manner. It is found that this kind of variable rates can stabilizing frontal instabilities by enhancing initial uniform mixing of solvent and oil. It therefore suppresses the later development of instabilities. Eventually, a much less unstable front is obtained when compared with the constant injection rate. Other parameters such as the amplitude of rates are also examined. The variations of propagation of front with time are analyzed for the change of rate strength. It is can therefore be concluded that this kind of time-dependent rate can improve oil recovery at very low additional rate within the capacity of pumps for the field EOR processes.

AB  - AbstractThe immiscible displacement of one viscous fluid by another within a porous medium forms the basis of most secondary-recovery schemes. The stability of such displacement processes is one of the factors which controls displacement efficiency. Consequently, it is of interest to be able to predict the onset ofil1Slability during such displacement processes. Using a force-potential approach and defining a macroscopic capillary pressure in the mobile-oil zone, a stability theory has been developed for a cylindrical flow system. The instability number has been defined along with its critical value beyond which the displacement is unstable. The stability boundary has been validated by means of published experimental data. IntroductionDuring water injection in an oil-bearing reservoir, the displacement velocity is maximal at the point of injection and decreases monotonically as the radial distance from the wellbore increases. Also from potentiometric studies it can be seen that, near the wellbore, the displacement process is essentially radial. Therefore, the cylindrical displacement model can be considered to be more appropriate to practical au-recovery situations than the linear-displacernent model, especially during the initial stage of the displacement process. Hence, it is important to be able to develop a stability theory for immiscible displacement in cylindrical systems. Unlike linear systems, previous investigation of instability in radial displacement systems is meagre. Bataille(1) made a theoretical and experimenta1 examination of the problem of instability of an initially circular interface between two immiscible fluids in radial flow in a Hele-Shaw cell. He showed that the condition for stability of the interface was Equation (1) (Available in full paper) where Ø is the interfacial tension, k is the absolute permeability. n is the number of fingers, µ1 and µ2 are the viscosities of the displacing and the displaced fluids, respectively. and rF is the radius of the hypothetical undisturbed interface when there is no fingering. Wilson(2) studied the mechanism of dynamic instability of an initially circular interface between two immiscible fluids in a Hele- Shaw coli. Adopting an analysis similar to the one described by Saffman and Taylor(3), he arrived. at a stability criterion identical to that derived by Bataille(1). Paterson(4) used the analysis of Bataille and Wilson to examine the initial stages of immiscible interfacial fingering for bath advancing and contracting displacement fronts. He derived the defining equation for the critical wavelength of the perturbation of the front. Also. he argued that, when the circumference of the front is less than the critical wavelength, the displacement is stable and the front remains circular. Ni et al. (3) extended Paterson's theory for immiscible radial fingering in a Hele-Shaw cell to that in a porous medium confined between two horizontal parallel plates.Nasr-El-Din et (6) studied the effect of flow rate on radial displacement patterns in water-wet porous media. They observed, as did Ni el al.(5), that at intermediate flow rates, recovery at breakthrough was independent of flaw rate; and at higher flow rates, recovery decreased with increasing flow rate to a second stabilized value independent of flow rate,

AB  - AbstractProblems encountered while drilling shale formations are a major factor in the cost of oil and gas wells. A principal cause of the problems has been shown to be the transfer of water and ions from water-based drilling fluids to shale formations. Prior studies have documented two driving forces involved in such transfer. One is the hydraulic pressure differential between the drilling fluid and shale pore fluid. A second is a chemical osmotic force dependent upon the difference between the water activity (vapor pressure) of the drilling fluid and that of the shale pore fluid under downhole conditions. Generally unrecognized is another driving force, diffusion osmosis, which is determined by the difference in concentrations of the solutes in the drilling fluid and shale pore fluid. Diffusion osmosis results in transfer of solutes and associated water from higher to lower concentration for each species, opposite to the flow of water in chemical osmosis. If the diffusion osmotic force exceeds the chemical osmotic force, invasion of ions and water can increase the pore pressure and water content of the shale near the borehole surface. Additionally, the invading ions can cause cation exchange reactions that alter the clay structure in the shale. All of these effects tend to destabilize the shale.Destabilizing ionic reactions within a shale can be minimized if a suitable nonionic polyol (such as methyl glucoside) is used to reduce the activity of a fresh-water drilling fluid. In certain situations the addition of salt to such a fresh-water drilling fluid to obtain further reduction of water activity can cause an increase in the diffusion osmotic force that offsets some, or all, of the desired increase in chemical osmotic force. This now is recognized to have probably been a factor when sodium chloride was included in the formulation of a methyl glucoside drilling fluid used with moderate success for drilling in the Gulf of Mexico.Chemical osmotic effectiveness can be improved by emulsification of a non-aqueous phase in the drilling fluid. A fresh-water drilling fluid containing methyl glucoside for activity control and emulsified pentaerythritol oleate prevented hydration and maintained stability of Pleistocene shale from the Gulf of Mexico. Drill cuttings from such a drilling fluid should be environmentally acceptable for discharge at offshore or land locations.IntroductionInteractions of water-based drilling and completion fluids with shale formations have long been recognized as a major factor in the cost of finding and producing oil and gas. Much progress has been made in understanding the mechanisms responsible for the destabilization of shale and subsequent problems such as high torque, stuck pipe, lost circulation and cementing failures. In most instances the problems can be avoided by use of hydrocarbon-based drilling fluids, but the use of those fluids are now being curtailed because of environmental concerns. The excellent shale stability provided by hydrocarbon-based fluids has been attributed in part to the establishment of an essentially ideal semipermeable membrane at the drilling fluid/shale interface. The membrane has openings large enough to allow water molecules to pass, but small enough to prevent passage of dissolved ions and molecules. This results in development of an osmotic pressure differential which is dependent upon the ratio of water activity (escaping tendency) of the drilling fluid (adf) to that of the shale pore fluid (as).1 The transfer of water is from the higher water activity (lower concentration of dissolved ions or molecules) to the lower water activity. Solutes, such as calcium chloride, can therefore be added to the water phase of a hydrocarbon-based emulsion fluid to reduce the water activity and develop enough osmotic force to prevent shale hydration, or even extract water from shale. This mechanism for water transfer is commonly designated chemical osmosis.

AB  - ABSTRACTA model is presented to predict the cross-flow displacement of a deep water marine riser or tether(tendon) due to vortex-shedding in a vertically-sheared flow. The displacement of each mode is determined by a balance between ,the energy fed into the structure over lock-in regions of the structure and the energy dissipated by the fluid damping over the remainder. The mathematical formulation makes use of the vortex-resonance amplitude profile of the structure in a uniform flow. This profile is approximated by a polynomial which is based on experimental values of reduced velocity bounds for vortex locking as well as the reduced velocity at the peak lock-in amplitude. The profile is also directly predicted using the wake-oscillator model. The drag coefficient is assumed to vary with the transverse displacement. The total amplitude response of the structure is calculated as a superposition of amplitudes of all excited vibration modes; A closed-form solution is presented for the case of a riser or tether of uniform mass and cross-section under a uniform flow. The numerical results indicate that, as expected, more than one structural mode is usually excited when the riser or tether is subjected to a sheared flow. Moreover an increase in shear parameter lecreases the peak response amplitude but broadens the lock-in range over which large oscillation amplitudes occur; the virtual drag coefficient can be significantly higher than the nominal value. It is found that the use of an average flow approximation to treat the sheared flow case may over-predict the vortex excited motion amplitudes. The predictions show a reasonable agreement with limited reported experimental observations.INTRODUCTIONMarine risers are critical components in offshore drilling and production systems. A riser is a long slender vertical cylindrical pipe placed at or near the sea surface and extending to the ocean floor.

AB  - ABSTRACTThe proper deployment and utilization of oil-containment barriers depends upon a knowledge of the failure mechanisms of such devices. This paper presents a simple empirical technique for predicting the water current velocity which will initiate one failure mode, i.e., entrainment failure. The critical velocity is a function of the specific gravity of the oil and the interfacial tension between the oil and water. INTRODUCTION The general behavior of an oil slick retained by a surface barrier against a current has been well documented by several investigations [1,2]. At low current velocities « 0.4 ft/sec) the oil-water interface is smooth and calm. The interfacial shear stress is balanced by hydrostatic forces and the slick profile is approximately parabolic as shown in Figure 1a. At slightly higher velocities (-0.7 ft/sec) a "headwave" develops near the leading edge of the slick as shown in Figure lb. This headwave phenomena is characteristic of gravity stratified flows and has been observed under many diverse flow situations not associated with oil slick behavior [3,4]. At some point in this velocity range gravitational waves develop at the oilwater interface. These waves move from the region immediately behind the headwave, the "neck", toward the barrier. Their velocity is approximately equal to the current velocity. Depending upon the dynamic characteristics of_ the barrier, the oil properties, etc., these waves may be reflected by the barrier. In some cases the reflected and incident waves may combine to form a stationary wave pattern along the interface. At higher velocities (-1.5 ft/sec) the headwave becomes unstable so that the small interfacial disturbances, i.e. capillary waves, generated at the leading edge of the slick "break" in the vicinity of the maximum headwave thickness or downstream of the maximum thickness. As these small waves break, oil droplets are formed and are injected into the water flow as shown in Figure Ie. Some of these droplets are pure oil and some are oil bubbles with a water core. Most of these droplets rise to the oil water interface before passing beneath the barrier. However, relatively few of the droplets recombine with the slick and a great percentage of ,the oil initially entrained at the headwave is lost beneath the barrier due either to re-entrainment from the interface caused by the interfacial gravity waves or to the interaction between the interfacial gravity waves and the barrier. All of the oil lost is initially entrained at the headwave. No interfacial instability or droplet formation has been observed along the slick downstream of the headwave. The droplets, once formed at the headwave, may flow to the barrier without re-entering the slick and may be entrained in the water flow repeatedly, each time rising back to the interface. Inasmuch as the failure of a barrier, having structural integrity and sufficient draft to retain a specific slick at high currents, may be due entirely to excessive entrainment losses it is of paramount importance that the current velocity at which the entrainment losses begin be known with some degree of reliability.

AB  - Abstract  Flow processes that involve the displacement of a viscous fluid by a less viscous one often lead to a hydrodynamic instability known as viscous fingering. In this study the viscous fingering instability for reactive flows will be addressed. In order to understand the physics of this reactive flow displacement, the basic equations of conservation of mass, energy and momentum are solved for a two-dimensional porous medium. The flow is modeled numerically using a spectral method based on the Hartley transformation. The streamfunction and concentration fields are determined for the two dimensional flow in every time-step to track the development of the flow. In this study, two different kinds of auto-catalytic reactions are considered and the effects of stoichiometry on finger patterns are examined. Finger patterns are analyzed for different values of the viscosity ratio, reaction rate and order. We will discuss how the interplay between chemical reaction and hydrodynamics could result in interesting instability schemes. Physical discussions of how the reactions may affect the viscous fingering patterns are also presented.  Introduction Fluidflows through porous media have are important because of their major applications in various industries. In this field, both experiment and theory have undergone a rapid development in the recent years1, 2, 3. In particular, it is known that the sweep, defined as "the fraction of reservoir area contacted by a displacing fluid to the reservoir area behind the displacement front??, is restricted by an interfacial instability instability called viscous fingering. This type of instability usually develops when a less viscous fluid displaces a more viscous one, and has many important applications in secondary oil recovery, soil contaminant elimination, and hydrology. While this interfacial instability plays a crucial role in a variety of instabilities vital to industrial processes, its dynamics also greatly influence more fundamental fields in different branches of science. One of the concerns in some industrial applications is related to the interaction between hydrodynamics and chemistry, in particular the effects of chemical reaction on the hydrodynamic instability.  Examples of applications that involve chemical reactions include heavy oil recovery, spreading of reactive pollutants in groundwater, frontal polymerization, and reactive infiltration in geochemical setting.

AB  - In the completion of oil and gas wells, successful cementing operations essentially require the complete removal of the drilling mud and its substitution by the cement slurry. Therefore, the displacement of one fluid by another one is a crucial task that should be designed and optimized properly to ensure the zonal isolation and integrity of the cement sheath. Proper cementing jobs ensure safety, while poor displacements lead to multiple problems, including environmental aspects such as contamination of fresh water bearings. There are a number of factors, such as physical properties of fluids, geometrical specifications of the annulus, flow regime, and flow rate, which can remarkably affect the displacement efficiency. The shape of the interface plays an influential role during the displacement process. For a highly efficient displacement the interface has to be as flat and stable as possible. However, unstable and elongated interfaces are associated with channeling phenomenon, excessive mixing, cement contamination, and consequently unsuccessful cementing operations. Thus, the stability of the interface between the two fluids has major importance in cementing applications. In the present work, a novel method for the prediction of interface instability and displacement efficiency is introduced. Instability analyses of the interface between the two fluids are carried out following the main ideas of the original Rayleigh-Taylor and Kelvin-Helmholtz instabilities. Moreover, using the same analyses, optimized designs for improvement of the displacement process in any specific situation are proposed. The influence of density, rheological properties, surface tension, and flow rate of the fluids on the instability and shape of the interface, and consequently on the displacement efficiency, is studied. Furthermore, an analytical solution of the displacement of fluids in the annular space that enables the calculation of the mixed volumes is developed. Additional time-dependent considerations are made for the calculations of cases with unstable interfaces. For the same cases studied, 3-D Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) simulations are performed, using commercially available CFD software. For the purpose of validation of the results, a number of experiments were conducted for fluids with various combinations of physical properties. The results present the effect of physical fluid properties, geometrical configurations, and flow rate on the instability of the interface and displacement efficiency. Reasonably good agreement between the results of all three approaches presented in the paper are observed and they all emphasize the importance of the proper selection of fluid properties and flow rates for any specific sequence, to minimize the degree of contamination and mixing. The discussions and results of this work provide insight into displacement process, invaluable guidelines for industrial applications, and compelling evidence of the importance of correct predictions and appropriate designs of the displacement of fluids in cementing operations.

AB  - Summary While casing-heading instability in single gas lift wells has attracted a lot of attention, gas-distribution instability in dual gas lift wells has not. In this paper, we present a simple, nonlinear dynamic model that is shown to capture the essential dynamics of the gas-distribution instability despite the complex nature of two-phase flow. Using the model, stability maps are generated showing regions of stable and unstable settings for the production valves governing the produced flows from the two tubings. Optimal steady-state production is shown to lie well within the unstable region, corresponding to a gas distribution between the production tubings that cannot be sustained without automatic control. A simple control structure is suggested that successfully stabilizes the gas-distribution instability in simulations and, more importantly, in laboratory experiments. Introduction Artificial lift is a common technique to increase tail-end production from mature fields, and injection of gas (gas lift) rates among the most widely used of such methods. Gas lift can induce severe production flow oscillations because of casing-heading instability, a phenomenon that originates from dynamic interaction between injection gas in the casing and the multiphase fluid in the tubing. The fluctuating flow typically has an oscillation period of a few hours and is distinctly different from short-term oscillations caused by hydrodynamic slugging. The casing-heading instability introduces two production-related challenges. Average production is decreased compared to a stable flow regime, and the highly oscillatory flow puts strain on downstream equipment. Reports from industry as well as academia suggest that automatic control (feedback control) is a powerful tool to eliminate casing-heading instability and increase production from gas lift wells (Kinderen et al. 1998; Jansen et al. 1999; Dalsmo et al. 2002; Boisard et al. 2002; Hu and Golan 2003; Eikrem et al. 2003; Aamo et al. 2005). Automatic control may or may not require downhole measurements. If downhole information is needed by the controller, the use of soft-sensing techniques may alleviate the need for downhole measurements. In Aamo et al. (2005), downhole pressure is estimated on line using a simple dynamic model and measurements at the wellhead only. The estimated pressure is in turn used in a controller for stabilizing the casing-heading instability. Understanding and predicting under which conditions a gas lift well will exhibit flow instability is important in every production-planning situation. This problem has been addressed by several authors by constructing stability maps [i.e., a 2D diagram that shows the regions of stable and unstable production of a well (Poblano et al. 2005; Fairuzov et al. 2004)]. The axes define the operating conditions in terms of the gas-injection rate and, for instance, the production-choke opening or wellhead pressure. A dual gas lift well is a well with two independent tubings producing from two different hydrocarbon-bearing layers and sharing a common lift gas supply. The injection gas is supplied through a common casing and injected into the tubings through two individual gas lift valves. A sketch of a typical system is shown in Fig. 1. The dual gas lift well introduces a new instability phenomenon: the gas-distribution instability. This relates to the fact that under certain operating conditions, it is impossible to sustain the feed of injected gas into both tubings. Instead, all the injected gas will eventually be routed through one of the gas lift valves. As a consequence, the second tubing produces poorly or not at all, decreasing the total production substantially. There are few reports, if any, on automatic control of dual gas lift wells, although Boisard et al. (2002) briefly mentions an application. In this paper, we present a simple, nonlinear dynamic model that captures the essential dynamics of the gas-distribution instability. It is an extension of the model for a single gas lift well presented in Eikrem et al. (2003) and Aamo et al. (2005). Using the model, we generate a stability map for a single-point dual gas lift well, and present a control structure for stabilizing the system at open-loop, unstable setpoints. The performance of the controller is demonstrated in simulations using the model, but more importantly, stabilization is also achieved in laboratory experiments. This paper is organized as follows. In the Mathematical Model section, a nonlinear dynamic model applicable to dual gas lift wells is presented, followed by a discussion on instability mechanisms and the generation of stability maps in the Instability Mechanisms and Control section. The stability analysis is based on computing eigenvalues for the linearized model, accompanied by simulations using the nonlinear model. The proposed control structure is presented in the Automatic Control segment of that section, and experimental results using a gas lift laboratory located at the U. of Technology—Delft are shown in the Laboratory Experiments section. The paper ends with discussion and conclusions in the Conclusions section.

AB  - Abstract: Wellbore instability problems are the cause for the majority of nonproductive time in the southern Iraqi field developments. These drilling difficulties pose potential problems such as mud losses in weak or vugular formations, stuck pipe in shales or unconsolidated formations. This paper focuses on the most severe problem in terms of effort and disbursement which is referred to pipe sticking in Tanuma shale formation. Examining the drilling data revealed that this phenomenon was mostly related to shear failure of the wellbore, which caused an immediate increase in the stand pipe pressure with no drilling fluid returns when circulating. In this regard, a geomechanical analysis for southern Iraqi field was performed on field data from 45 deviated. The analysis identified the following areas of improvement. First, the mud weight being used was not changed properly with respect to variation in wells azimuth and inclination. Secondly, anisotropic effects of this shale formation caused by the bedding planes should be considered in wells trajectory design. Due to the lack of published studies regarding wellbore problems in southern Iraqi fields, this paper could serve as case history for similar fields in that region. Introduction Numerous borehole instabilities were observed in the drilling operations of deviated wells through shaly formations in southern Iraqi oil and gas fields. These problems usually escalate during increased inclination of the wells, resulting in significant nonproductive time. Drilling data from various deviated wells designed to drill the productive interval of limestone (Mishrif formation) in different inclinations and azimuths from different slots is shown in Figure 1. Various problems have been occurred; varying from, stuck pipe, mud losses, sulfurous water flowing, hole tightening, and extensive caving. The stuck pipe problems caused wells to be drilled with more than one side tracks or loss of the hole in worst case. Whereas other problems could considerably increase the nonproductive time or well control issues for severe mud losses. Therefore, the diagnosis of the root cause of borehole failure is a necessary procedure in the well constructing and planning phase. Another possible type of problem is the collapse failure of the borehole which happens when the formation around the vicinity of the wellbore wall fails due to either shear or tensile failure (Fjaer, 2008). Consequently, the wellbore will be tightened or packed off if the drilling cuttings are inadequately transported out of the hole (due to insufficient mud properties, flow rate or string rotation). Additionally, the stuck pipe may occur when the plastic region around the borehole is unexpectedly yielded in the case of insufficiently supported by the borehole pressure (Tare et al., 2002). However, if the drilling fluid density is greater than the weakest formation fracture gradient then the drilling fluid will be lost, and fracture treatments should be performed. Besides, the high difference between wellbore pressure and formation pressure could lead to differential sticking incidents. Pipe sticking is the most severe problem with the majority of the nonproductive time. Borehole shear failure could be one of the potential reasons for this drilling instability. This paper will focus on the geomechanical analysis of wellbore instabilities of the Tanuma shale in southern Iraqi fields. The study aims to address the minimum required mud weight in order to prevent the onset of shear failure wellbore for different well paths.

AB  - AbstractWellbore instability has long been a great concern in the oil/gas well drilling industry since it may incur expensive operation cost. In this paper, we present a detailed analysis of instability of wellbore drilled in weakly consolidated rock formations through an elaborate poro-elastoplastic numerical model. The Drucker-Prager/cap plasticity model, by which both shear compressive plastic deformation and volumetric plastic deformation can be taken into account, is employed to more precisely characterize the mechanical behavior of weakly consolidated rock formations. Possible infiltration of drilling fluid into the formation has also been considered. With this model, plastic yielding and fracturing behavior of the borehole surrounding rocks under different conditions are analyzed. Results show that, during drilling with low mud pressure, the rock formation in the near-wellbore region firstly experiences some compressive plastic deformation and then shear plastic deformation. Excessive radial inward displacement of the wellbore may occur if the mud pressure is too low. If penetration of drilling fluid into the formation is prohibited, fracturing of the wellbore may not occur even with high mud pressure. Instead, high mud pressure may cause cavity expansion phenomenon at the wellbore, i.e. the wellbore will expand substantially and the deformed wellbore radius could be 2 times larger than the initial wellbore radius. In the other hand, if drilling fluid can penetrate into the formation, the pore pressure within the near-wellbore region could be raised, resulting in tensile hoop stress at the wellbore and thus fracturing of the wellbore. Some implications for drilling stable wells in weakly consolidated formations have been provided based on the numerical analysis results.1. IntroductionThe past decades has witnessed a worldwide growth in the exploration and development of oil and gas in deepwater and ultra-deepwater due to the increasing energy demand and evolving technologies. Nowadays, more than 40% of the newly proved oil and gas resources are found in deepwater (Yan et al., 2015), thus it has been expected that the share of offshore oil and gas production from deepwater would further increase in the future. Recently, China is also launching more and more efforts to develop deepwater oil/gas resources.Despite considerable technological advancements, deepwater drilling is still a non-trivial task and there exists various challenges during the whole process of drilling due to the complex deepwater environments (Rocha et al., 2003). Among various problems, wellbore instability is a major obstacle for achieving quick and cost-efficient drilling. Actually, wellbore instability has long been a notorious problem in the drilling industry, irrespective of whether the well is drilled onshore or offshore, resulting in remarkable economical loss and nonproductive time. For deepwater drilling, maintaining wellbore stability is an even more difficult task since the overburden stress in deepwater is relatively low due to the long water column, resulting in narrow safe mud density windows (Aadnoy, 1998; Rocha, et al., 2003). Especially in the shallow sediments, where the formation rock is generally soft and weakly-consolidated or even unconsolidated, special carefulness is needed to avoid wellbore instabilities like fracturing of the formation, lost circulation, excessive borehole closure as well as borehole collapse.Currently, common practices of wellbore stability analysis are mostly based on linear elasticity theory (Bradley, 1979; Papanastasiou and Zervos, 2004). These traditional wellbore stability analysis procedures may overestimate the required minimum drilling mud density due to the requirement of completely no plastic deformation on the wellbore wall. Actually, for soft rocks like the shallow sediments in deepwater, it has been recognized that the wellbore can remain stable even if the surrounding rock has been loaded into plastic state (Charlez, 1997; Chen and Abousleiman, 2017; Zheng, 1998). In the other hand, soft rocks may have experienced plastic deformation before fracturing caused by high mud pressure, which is not considered in the traditional elastic model. Thus, in recent years, various elastoplastic models have been proposed and employed for analyzing the stresses and deformations around the wellbore (Chen and Abousleiman, 2017; Chen et al., 2011; Detournay and Fairhurst, 1987;McLellan and Wang, 1994;Muller et al., 2009;Wang and Dusseault, 1991), and borehole stability is realized by restricting either the area of plastic region (McLellan and Wang, 1994) or the borehole closure (Chen and Abousleiman, 2017) to be less than some designated values derived from field experiences.

DISCUSSION OF THIS PAPER IS INVITED.

Summary Previous theoretical researchers successfully generated viscous finger patterns by assuming a randomly distributed boundary condition in their numerical models. Our objective is to identify a natural source of the randomness that underlies their success. A source of fluid flow instability is discerned by viewing fingering as a chaotic (non linear dynamical) phenomenon. phenomenon. We begin by showing that miscible displacement models can be expressed as nonlinear generalizations of the linear convection-dispersion equation. A nonlinear dynamical analysis technique is used to study the stability of the nonlinear system. Detailed study of several 1D and 2D cases illustrates the applicability of the stability analysis. Introduction Viscous fingers play an important role in determining the success or failure of a fluid displacement process. Much effort has been expended in the study of viscous fingering. e.g., Refs. 1 and 2, yet several important problems remain to be solved. Among the problems awaiting explanation is the question of what causes the disturbances that propagate as viscous fingers. A widely held notion in the industry is that reservoir heterogeneities are the source of the disturbances. Previous work suggests that nonlinear dynamics provide an alternative perspective on the source of disturbances in porous media or perspective on the source of disturbances in porous media or analogs such as Hele-Shaw cells. Christie and Bond have recently applied chaotic concepts to the description of fingering. Their idea was to impose a boundary condition with a random distribution about a user-specified average value. They were able to numerically generate finger patterns using a nonlinear miscible displacement model. This work may be viewed as a numerical experiment that provides justification for applying chaos concepts to the viscous provides justification for applying chaos concepts to the viscous fingering problem. The introduction of a randomly distributed boundary condition is an assumption. Why does the assumption appear to work? What mechanism is responsible for the randomness? One obvious explanation for floods performed in porous media is the randomness associated with the flow paths of a porous medium. This answer is incomplete, however, because the presence of a porous medium is not a prerequisite for the presence of a porous medium is not a prerequisite for the appearance of viscous fingers. Indeed, pioneering studies of viscous fingering did not even use a porous medium. These studies used a seemingly simple system called a Hele-Shaw cell. Fluid flow in a Hele-Shaw cell is restricted to the space between two parallel plates. A well-constructed radial Hele-Shaw cell should exhibit radial symmetry. It would seem that the uniformity of a Hele-Shaw cell would preclude any cell related source of instability. That this is so is evidenced by the early time radial behavior observed at the inlet of a radial Hele-Shaw cell. Yet explanations of fingering in Hele-Shaw cells usually presuppose the presence of a perturbation in the system. presuppose the presence of a perturbation in the system. P. 99-1 P. 99-1

AB  - A series of bare-hull resistance and self-propulsion tests were carried out on a 1/8 scale model of a 11.8 m long, waterjet-propelled planing hull in the clear water towing tank at the National Research Council of Canada's Institute for Marine Dynamics. The bare-hull resistance tests, performed with the waterjet inlets closed, spanned a range of eight model velocities and nine ballast conditions consisting of three displacements each with three positions of the longitudinal center of gravity. The hull was then fitted with two model waterjet thrusters and tested over the same speeds and ballast conditions. Dynamic instability, or porpoising, was seen during certain high-speed tests. A discussion of this behavior and its relation to published dynamic stability limits is given.

AB  - Abstract Wettability of a reservoir rock can be altered by changing brine composition, e.g., lowering salinity, adding surfactants. Wettability alteration can mobilize stranded oil and enhance oil recovery. Analytical solution for 1D tertiary low salinity flood shows two saturation shocks one of which is associated with an adverse mobility ratio. The adverse mobility ratio across this shock is not very large, about 1.5 to 3.75 in the cases considered. As the viscosity ratio increases, the width of the oil bank decreases and one of the shocks disappears at high viscosity ratio (>10). The remaining shock at high viscosity ratio is stable. A viscous fingering model is applied to describe the flow instability in relatively homogeneous multi-dimensional porous media. It shows that the viscous fingering is mild and the breakthrough of low salinity injectant is only 11-31% faster than in the 1D flow. If only salts are used for wettability alteration, the capillary pressure is significant and becomes more positive (more water-wet) at low salinity. Positive capillary pressure can provide stability to the flood fronts, unlike surfactant floods where low interfacial tension removes the stabilizing capillary pressure. Low salinity floods are expected to be mildly unstable due to low mobility ratio at adverse saturation shocks and presence of capillary pressure. Introduction Wettability is a key reservoir property which has long been recognized to affect the rock-fluid properties such as residual oil saturation, relative permeability and capillary pressure. Wettability of a mineral surface, oil and water is the preference of the one fluid to adhere over the second fluid. It is often described by a contact angle (through the water phase, by convention) q formed at the solid-oil-water contact line. If q<60°, the solid is considered water-wet; if q>120°, oil-wet and in between intermediate-wet. Wettability depends on brine, oil, and mineral compositions.1 The relation between oil composition and wettability has been studied by atomic force microscopy.2 Often, the reservoir rocks are heterogeneous in terms of mineral composition. Then the wettability is not necessarily homogeneous over the pore surface. If part of the pore surface is water-wet and the other part oil-wet, the rock is called mixed-wet.3 At the core-scale, the wettability is often characterized by the Amott wettability index. This index is based on spontaneous and forced imbibition of fluids.4   Once thought to be predominantly water-wet, it is now believed that many reservoirs are mixed-wet.5,6 Oil is often produced in source rocks and then migrates into originally water-wet reservoirs. Some of the polar components of crude oil, mostly asphaltenes and resins, collect at the water/oil interface7 and adsorb onto the mineral surface if the water film breaks. Stability of water films depends on the disjoining pressure, which in turn depends on brine, oil, mineral compositions, and the applied capillary pressure.8-10 The effect of wettability on multiphase transport through porous media has been studied by many. Typically, as the water-wettability decreases, the oil relative permeability decreases and water relative permeability increases.11,12 Capillary pressure (defined as Po-Pw) decreases as rocks become less water-wet and becomes negative when oil-wet. Mixed-wet rocks have both positive and negative regions of capillary pressure. The residual oil saturation to waterflood is the highest for strongly water-wet conditions. As the rock becomes mixed- or intermediate- wet, the residual saturation typically decreases.13,14 It again increases slightly when the rock becomes oil-wet. Wettability alteration can decrease residual oil saturation. Wettability alteration has been attempted by introducing surfactants, altering salinity, and increasing temperature. Many carbonate rocks are oil-wet / mixed-wet; surfactants have been identified to make the calcite surface relatively water-wet, q<90°.15-18 Treatment with only potential determining ions (e.g., SO42-) at a high enough temperature can induce brine imbibition in initially oil-wet carbonates.19,20 Increase in temperature can also induce increasing water wettability in diatomites21 and limestones22. Decrease in divalent ions along with low salinity can decrease oil-wetness in sandstones23 and is known as low salinity waterflood. Low salinity waterflood has been tested in laboratory-scale.24 The improvement in oil recovery has been seen mostly in sandstones with clays, with crude oils, and at high temperatures. Fines production is not significant in these studies, though they were observed in earlier studies.25 Low salinity waterflood has also been tested in field single well tests and looks promising.26 The incremental recovery seems to correlate with the kaolinite content. Jerauld et al.27 have modeled this process for field application.

AB  - Abstract: World-wide mining operations utilize block caving as one of the most cost-effective techniques for ore extraction. Block caving has been addressed in the past by numerous discontinua methods to include Discrete Element Method (DEM), Discontinuous Deformation Analysis (DDA), Combined Finite-Discrete Element Method (FDEM), etc. However, most of these analyses were either limited to 2D or to elastic material representation. In this paper a representative 3D block caving problem is simulated using FDEM. Los Alamos National Laboratory’s Geophysics team conducted the modeling utilizing their in-house FDEM code, MUNROU. MUNROU is a fully parallel, 2D/3D FDEM code which utilizes material models that account for a number of plasticity effects, as well as has the capability to model explosive effects, irregular shapes and fracture initiation and propagation. Previously problems of this nature and size were un-tractable in 3D. However, the recent performance improvements seen in MUNROU through the implementation of state of the art parallelization algorithms (see Computational Mechanics of Discontinua, Wiley 2011), have prompted our team to begin intensive efforts to address real world problems, such as block caving. The code’s inherent capability to address fracture and fragmentation processes at laboratory scale level has been consistently proven in the past. In this paper the feasibility of extending MUNROU to large space scales in 3D is demonstrated. With this improved capability it is now expected that future analyses efforts can concentrate on 3D phenomenological considerations such as jointing, frictional fault behavior, etc.

Examples of the application of the analytical model under sub-critical flow conditions indicate that the size of the plastic failure grows as the fluid flow rate increases. At the critical flow rate, the analytical formulation implies that the entire formation develops tensile failure and becomes unstable; a scenario that cannot be substantiated under field conditions. To investigate the mechanisms resulting in the initiation and termination of instability around wellbores, a fully coupled flow and deformation finite element model capable of tracking the formation response under tensile-failure conditions was developed. Application of the numerical model to a field problem that had experienced instability and sand production during its primary operating phase revealed that, for a specific geometry and formation properties, there exists a critical fluid pressure gradient which, if exceeded, would result in sand failure and its pressure gradient which, if exceeded, would result in sand failure and its production. The increase in permeability that occurs in the collapsed zone production. The increase in permeability that occurs in the collapsed zone causes a corresponding reduction in the fluid pressure gradient to sub-critical levels and hence results in the termination of sand influx. The results from the numerical study are found to be consistent with the field observations.IntroductionWellbore instability adds substantially to industry-wide drilling and operating costs. Breakouts of the wellbores may create mud control problems, increase drilling time, cause pipe sticking and side tracking in problems, increase drilling time, cause pipe sticking and side tracking in weakly-cemented oil sand formations, instability results in solid particles influx (commonly referred to as sand production) which in some instances has led to well suspension (Smith). Woodland's survey of the instability-related drilling problems in Canada sets the overall cost at around $60 M/year. The cost for some individual wells in the western Canadian overthrust belt is estimated to be in excess of $250 K.The physics of formation failure and instability induced by well creation and its operation is as follows. As a vertical borehole is drilled, the radial stress at the face of the borehole decreases from the insitu horizontal stress value to the fluid pressure in the hole. Wellface failure (plastic-failure) results from the mechanical inability of the wall material to sustain the loss of radial support and the redistributed stresses. In uncemented formations, the potential for instability (tensile-failure) and sand production develops once fluid starts flowing through the wellface; however, in cemented formations sand production will only occur after the fluid-pressure gradient exceeds a certain critical value.

AB  - AbstractA transparent model of a reservoir has been used to study some characteristics of instability in miscible displacement. The linear model dimensions are 1/4 in.×9 1/2 in.×10 ft. The model is packed with spherical glass beads. Three groups of experiments have been performed. The objectives were to measure, respectively, the rate of growth of the transition zone, flow velocity variations in the transition zone, and the effect of a graded viscosity zone on stability. All experiments were compared, where possible, with theory.The transition zone grew almost linearly with distance traveled, regardless of flow rate, where adverse viscosity ratios were used. At very adverse viscosity ratios and large distances traveled, some reduction below linear growth was noted. This could be attributed to the effects of mixing. General similarity in flow pattern was commonly shown in different tests, although exceptions occurred at the higher viscosity ratios.Injection of tracer spots permitted direct experimental measurement of velocity variations. Statistical methods were used to compare observed velocity variations with recently published theories. Surprisingly good agreement with some theoretical predictions was obtained.In the experiments using an initially graded viscosity zone, macroscopic stability was reached before predicted by theory. Under conditions theoretically considered to be slightly unstable, any fingering tendency was too slight to become observable within a 10-ft long system.The general correlation of all experiments with published theory was good, and suggests that theoretical predictions can be extended to reservoir problems.INTRODUCTIONEarly laboratory studies of miscible displacement demonstrated the high recovery efficiency possible with this method. Linear laboratory models showed that, under some circumstances, all in - place hydrocarbons could be recovered using as little solvent as 5 per cent of the pore volume. These results led to a series of pilot field projects. Under realistic conditions, however, other laboratory studies showed that a small solvent bank may not recover much more oil than a conventional gas drive. The cause of this lack of efficiency is unstable viscous fingering. The size of the solvent bank required to give optimum recovery is, therefore, a question of great economic significance.The object of the experiments described in this paper was the quantitative measurement of unstable flow parameters, the verification of present theories on the miscible displacement process, and correlation of these theories with experimental observation. Of the theories which have been advanced, those by Dougherty, Koval and Perrine show promise of predicting reservoir performance with reasonable accuracy.1-7 The present experiments were correlated, where possible, with the theories of Koval and Perrine. Dougherty's theory was not used because of the additional computational difficulty it presented and the belief that no further information would result.EXPERIMENTAL EQUIPMENTA transparent reservoir model, consisting of a vertical reinforced plexiglass column, was used for the experiments. The column was packed with glass beads, which served as the porous medium. To induce a known velocity disturbance in the flow, a double cosine wave restriction in the transverse cross-section was placed at the top of the column. To mark the flow field and provide a means of measuring the local fluid velocity, a dye-spot injection system was provided. The column was 10 ft high by 9 1/2 in. wide by 1/4 in. deep. The cosine restriction was placed 16 in. from the top of the column. The glass beads were smooth and spherical and had a mean diameter of 0.0102 cm.

AB  - ABSTRACT:Many instability events of bank slopes due to the construction of reservoir have occurred. The material strength deduction and the hydraulic effect are two important provocative factors. The slope deformation and instability manner are linked with the geometry of the potentially unstable rock-mass, the mechanics of materials and the water level fluctuation. The slope stability evolution is controlled by the geometry of the unstable rock-mass, the hydrogeological condition and the shear resistance of the sliding surface.1. INTRODUCTIONThe deformation and the slope failure provoked by the water reservoir is a common problem in the hydraulic project. But there was not enough attention until the Vaiont event in 1963 caused 2600 of death. In 1961, still in the construction of Zhaxi dam (Hunan, China), the reservoir water fluctuation induced a rockslide that is very near the dam. This sliding caused 60 of death. During the filling and first fluctuation of the Gepatsch reservoir (Austria) between 1965 and 1969, more than ten meters of displacement was measured in the slope just before the dam. In 1992, the reservoir filling of Geheyan dam (Hubei, China) resulted in some important deformation and several old landslides. Most of this deformation became stable after 2-3 years, but there is one landslide (Maoping) whose deformation increases till today. In the reservoir region of the Three-Gorges dam, about 1300 old landslides or unstable slopes have been found. Most of the landslides will be partly submerged. The stability evolution of these landslides will be a great study topic. The deduction of material strength and the hydraulic effect are thought two main provocation factors of slope failure (Fujita, 1977; Zaruba and Mencl, 1982: Nakamura, 1985: Y.J.Cai, 2000). R.Cojean et al (1990) made a quantitative study of stability evolution relative to the slope structure. But our knowledge is still not enough to predict the future's situation of a slope in the reservoir. We don't know exactly how evolve the material strength following the submersion, how evolve the actual slope stability following the water level fluctuation.2. MATERIAL MECHANIC EFFECT OF RESERVOIR ON THE SLOPEThree states of saturation exist for the geological material: dry, non-saturated and saturated. The strength of rock changes following the water content. For the clay rock, the deduction of compressive strength reaches 50-60% but only 10-20% for the sandstone. The deduction of cohesion is more important than the interne friction angle. The first one reaches often to 20-30%, the later only 10-20% (Fig. 1). For the fractured rockmass, the stress concentration and the fissure extension are another important effect that promotes the mobilization of a new failure. We construct a slope with 70m of height and take a modelling of the stress evolution with the following parameters: compressive module 10GPa, shear module 9GPa, specific weight 25kN/m³, cohesion 2MPa and friction angle 45°. Four groups of fissure with 0.5m thickness and 10m in length are set at different positions. Each group is composed of 3-4 fissures who are near but don't intersect each other.

AB  - Summary Innovative geomechanical, drilling, logging, and seismic techniques have been used to successfully develop a geologically complex discovery in the North Sea, Tullich field. With individual reservoir-unit thicknesses below the limit of seismic resolution, and a restricted depth window for completion, optimal placement of horizontal production wells was vital to the successful and economical development of the field. Wellbore instability was a key concern after recent experiences while drilling similar formations in nearby fields. These events had resulted in significant nonproductive time and cost overruns. A geomechanical model was constructed from data acquired during the appraisal-drilling phase and was used to make stability predictions for the proposed horizontal production wells. Wellbore instability while drilling was prevented through the application of a real-time wellbore-stability management system that validated the stability predictions by monitoring surface and downhole drilling parameters, produced solids, fluids, and log data. By combining efficient teamwork and a variety of logging and drilling technologies, the complex reservoir was successfully developed, both in terms of cost savings during well construction and subsequent oil production that exceeded expectation. Introduction The Tullich oil field is situated in Block 9/23a (Fig. 1) and operated 100% by Kerr-McGee North Sea (U.K.) Ltd. It lies 5 km south of the Gryphon field and came on stream in August 2002 as a subsea tieback from a central manifold to the Gryphon "A?? floating production, storage, and offloading facility. Hamilton Brothers originally discovered the field in 1991 by drilling Wells 9/23a-27 and 9/23a-27Z, where thin oil- and gas-bearing sands were encountered within the Eocene Balder formation. The sidetrack Well 9/23a-27Z was successfully drillstem tested. However, development of the prospect was not considered commercially viable at the time. Advances in seismic and drilling technologies led Kerr-McGee to reconsider the prospect and acquire the block in 1999. In 2001 they implemented an exploration and appraisal program by drilling two vertical Wells (9/23a-29A and 9/23a-31) and six sidetracks (9/23a-29Z through 9/23a-29U). Kerr-McGee recorded a 3D seismic survey in 1990, and in 1999 a 3D ocean-bottom cable (OBC) seismic survey was acquired over the Gryphon field and northern part of Block 9/23a. Inversion of the shear data from the OBC survey indicated the potential for extensive development of the Lower Eocene Balder sand, culminating in the exploration drilling program in 2001. The reservoir is of excellent quality and is interpreted to be a complex of turbidite sands, which lie in the Balder B2 zone directly above the massive tuff (Balder B1 zone) shown in Fig. 2. While the individual sands are below seismic resolution, the package could be mapped on the new seismic. An oil column extends 200 ft between a gas cap above and an aquifer below. The development program of four horizontal wells began in early 2002 with the drilling of Well 9/23a-T2 and concluded in October the same year with the completion of Well 9/23a-T3. The wells had horizontal sections between 3,852 and 5,606 ft. This paper describes how the seismic, core, drilling, and logging data acquired during the appraisal phase were used to evaluate wellbore-stability hazards, and how that information was included in the successful drilling and completion of the horizontal development wells. Details of how drilling and well-placement difficulties in this structurally complex environment were overcome are presented in recent publications by Greiss et al. (2003) and McDonald and Tribe (2003).

AB  - Abstract Gas lift is one of the artificial lift methods that is used to increase oil recovery by gas injection into production tubing. At the injection point, chocking effect has been identified as one of the factors that affect production instability. Fluctuation of the injected gas pressure, affects the gas/liquid interface behavior. Influence of the gas composition on the production efficiency, to our knowledge, has not been addressed in literature as an additional factor that plays role in efficiency. The flow instability leads to discrepancies between the forecasted and the actual production. The main objective of this study is to address the production instability of gas lift wells in transient (dynamic) and steady state simulations for continuous gas injection regime. Sensitivity investigations for stability analysis are performed for the various gas compositions, gas injection rates, injection pressure, prudctivity index (PI) and gas lift valves (GLV) port size. The results show that higher gas density, higher gas injection rate, higher injection pressure, higher PI and lower gas lift port size can stabilize the gas lifted well. When, relating the gas composition to density for black oil in dynamic and steady state simulation, it is interesting to see opposite effects are obtained from the results that are obtained these simulations, where dynamic simulation shows that the heavier gas gives larger production rates compared to lower gas density, while the opposite is obtained from the used steady state simulator.

AB  - ABSTRACT: Wellbore instability and formation sand production pose potential risks for wellbore drilling, completion and production operations. In many sandstone reservoirs worldwide, sand production has been observed to accompany oil and gas production. In this study, we aim to estimate, predict and quantify wellbore instability and sand production potentials in the Hajdúszoboszló field, Pannonian Basin, Hungary, using the Mechanical Earth Model (MEM). Our study relies on petrophysical log data obtained from an onshore gas well within the field as input data. Our 1-D MEM utilizes a workflow that develops wellbore and sand failure mechanisms, first creating the mechanical stratigraphy of the reservoir rock; followed by estimating the pore pressure, overburden stress, rock strength, rock elastic properties, and horizontal stresses of the reservoir rock with reference to the depth of stratigraphic column, from compressional slowness, shear slowness, density, porosity and shale volume. Lastly, we conduct a wellbore stability and sand management analysis. Our results show the mechanical stratigraphy of unconsolidated sandstone and shale distribution in the reservoir, wellbore shear and tensile failures, wellbore breakout and breakdown pressures, wellbore sensitivity analysis, sanding interval analysis, critical drawdown pressure (CDDP) profile and sand failure zones. Based on careful observation of our results, we predict the wellbore intervals with high sand production potentials and wellbore instability within the reservoir formations. Therefore, we suggest significant wellbore failure during drilling process and also a high possibility of sand production into the wellbore during well completion at a formation interval of 550-937 m. Although there is need for data from additional wells in the field to be incorporated into our model prediction, we suggest that our preliminary model can be useful for critical decision making during drilling and completion operations across the Hajdúszoboszló field, Pannonian Basin, Hungary. In addition, our study provides a platform for further investigation into wellbore stability and sanding analysis in other parts of the Pannonian Basin where available well data can also be incorporated in our model.

AB  - AbstractWellbore instability and formation damage are the two major problems encountered by the petroleum industry. It is commonly accepted that formation damage is mainly caused by fluid-rock interaction due to the change in pore fluid chemistry which is caused by invading mud filtrate. Invasion of mud filtrate can be reduced by forming a tight filter cake on the wellbore wall. A tight filter cake can also provide support to the wellbore wall and prevent wellbore collapse. Therefore, the most effective option for solving wellbore instability and formation damage problems is to design a drilling mud that is compatible with formations in relation to both fluid-rock interaction and mud caking characteristics. This paper considers a number of mud systems with novel features and investigates their potential use in drilling and completion of tight gas formations in Central Australia, which are highly susceptible to formation damage. Among the four (4) muds investigated, ester based mud has been found to be the most effective in reducing formation damage by producing a tight filter cake on the wellbore wall.P. 113

AB  - AbstractThe presence of microfractures is now recognized as a common cause of severe wellbore instability, particularly in ultra-low permeability rocks such as shales and some limestones.In unstable microfractured formations, it is important to avoid pressurizing the fractures with drilling mud. This paper examines the rock mechanics aspects of wellbore instability in microfractured formations, and identifies drilling fluids and drilling practices that reduce the problem. Improved stability can be achieved by the use of certain drilling fluid additives that seal fractures. Limited success is seen with sized solids, asphalts, gilsonites or conventional lost circulation materials but a recently developed additive for use in oil- or water-based muds appears to prevent much of the instability normally observed.The mechanism of action of this additive is discussed and a recent field case history presented.IntroductionWellbore instability during drilling can be due to one or more of several reasons and may appear as cavings, tight hole or hole erosion. The consequences include poor hole cleaning (sometimes leading to packing off, stuck pipe and, ultimately, sidetracks), poor quality cementing, poor quality logs, inefficient perforating, difficulties running in and out of hole, and poor mud condition.Before action can be taken to improve stability, it is vital that the problem formations are located and the mechanisms of instability identified. Once the causes are understood, an informed decision can be made on how well planning, drilling practices and drilling fluid formulations can be modified to reduce problems and costs.Of all the rock formations that show severe instability, shale is widely considered to be the most common and most problematic. The frequent occurrence of instability in shales is due to a number of reasons:More shale footage is drilled than any other type of rockShales are mechanically weak and hence fail under lower stresses than, for instance, well cemented sandstones or carbonatesShales contain clay minerals that can react with some types of drilling fluidsMany shales are poorly cemented and hence easily eroded by flowing mudShales generally have very low permeabilities, often in the nanoDarcy range. This means that an effective mud cake does not form and so the pore pressure is not protected from the mud overbalance, as it would be in more permeable rocks such as sandstone1. The pore pressure will be increased in the near wellbore region2 and will not bleed off because of the very low matrix permeability; hence the effective stress reduces and the rock becomes weakerBecause of the low permeability and the often rapid rates of deposition and burial, shales can become overpressured with respect to other sediments in the geological columnTherefore, before a shale instability problem can be addressed, a number of questions must be asked?Is it due to pore pressure (or overpressure) in competent shale? If so, raising the mud weight is a reasonable approach provided other formations exposed do not fracture, differential sticking risks in permeable formations do not become unacceptably high or - if the payzone is to be drilled - increased invasion rates do not cause formation damage.Is it due to chemical reactions between the drilling fluid and the shale? If so, can the water-based mud be modified or should a move be made to oil- or synthetic-based muds?Are the shales soft enough to be easily eroded by the circulating mud? If so, can the bit and fluid hydraulics be changed to reduce the problem?Are the shales fractured - either naturally or induced by the drilling process? If the fractures are induced, what can be done to prevent this happening? If the fractures are naturally occurring, what can be done to stabilize these fragile formations?

AB  - SCOPE: 1) A simple case history. 2) What is the required stability of a wellbore ? 3) Key factors of instability. 4) Recent progress and review 1) A SIMPLE CASE HISTORYEven if this does not happen on a routine basis, wellbore instability is unfortunately quite a common feature of drilling. It seems interesting to start the general report on this subject by a short description of a case of instability, without any specific worsening problem. This case is from the Norwegian North Sea, but it will look familiar to any drilling engineer. The Hordaland group is a thick formation (about 1500 m) which covers most of the reservoirs in the North Sea. Even if it is of course variable from one place to another, it is mainly composed of clayey formation, claystone at the top and more indurated shale at the bottom. In that particular case, the well was drilled with a 12" 1/4 bit. The bottom of the Hordaland group was at about 2000 m. The sequence of events is reported on the following table (Figure 1). This sequence of event is quite typical of a wellbore instability. The hole was drilled through the shale on day 1 with a mud weight of 1.13, and the well deepened into the underlying formation. The trip to the surface was smooth. While running the new bit down, it was necessary to redrill the hole down from 1950 m. This may indicate that instability started during the trip. However the mud weight was slightly raised because shale "cavings" (chips of rocks producted by hole wall caving) were coming on the shakers. A "wiper trip" was decided to control the hole stability after the well had been circulated "bottom up", i.e. for a sufficiently long time to bring all the cuttings to the surface. While pulling out, the pipe got stuck when the bit was at 2232. It was impossible neither to rotate the pipe, nor to circulate. After a while, circulation was restored, and lots of cavings came to the surface with a high viscous pill. After some time working on the stuck pipe, it was decided to disconnect the stuck part of the pipe ("back off"), to cement the hole above the "fish," and to start a new hole at 1980 m.(side-track). On day 19 the drilling reached the previously reached depth on day 11. Even for a simple instability, this means a loss of 8 days, on an offshore rig where 70 persons are working permanently. This is why wellbore stability is considered as a serious concern by most of the oil industry operators. In this particular well, caliper logs revealed that at the bottom of the shaly Hordaland group the hole was largely caved. The instability must have started during the first trip but was not causing serious problems to the drilling operation. It seems however that large "cavings" were produced, which cannot be carried up to the surface by a regular mud flow.

AB  - A successful cement placement can provide zonal isolation and environmental safety. Effective design of cement placement and mud removal impact all the stages of the wellbore life from drilling ahead to production. Accurate predictions of fluid displacement in the wellbore are vital to design fluid properties and plan the cementing job. In this work, an analytical model is developed to simulate the displacement of fluids in eccentric annuli. This paper presents a novel method for the solution of cement/mud displacement and evaluation of inter-fluid contamination during displacement for eccentric annuli. This new approach starts by addressing the problem of single fluid flow in eccentric annuli by solving analytically the governing transport equations for a flow inside an unwrapped annulus. The solution is, then, extended to a system of two fluids in a vertical annulus by adjusting the boundary conditions for displacement. The model is completed by adding the time-dependent calculation of interface between the two fluids, enabling the accurate determination of the amount of mixing and displacement efficiency. The analytical method proposed is used to simulate single and multi-fluid flows and study the effect of fluid properties of cement, spacer, and drilling mud at different flow rates on displacement efficiency, for both concentric and eccentric, vertical annuli. 3-dimensional Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) simulations were also performed and the results were compared to the analytical solution. Moreover, instability of the interface in all the cases was studied and the analysis offers an understanding of the role of fluid properties and proposes applicable optimized design to enhance the displacements. The amount of mixing and contamination that occurs during the displacement was calculated for both methods. The analytical solution and CFD produce results within a 13% difference, which validates the analytical model. Evidence was gathered to support that the improper design of fluid properties and flow rate along with a highly eccentric annulus can lead to substantial cement contamination. This may lead to under-designing the amount of fluids to be pumped to provide a complete mud removal and an efficient cement placement. On the other hand, learnings and models developed allow optimizing fluid properties that may lead to best outcomes even for highly eccentric annulus. The undeniable importance of a complete cement displacement is addressed by means of an analytical solution of the displacement, which provides a realistic prediction of the amount of inter-fluid mixing and cement contamination. This approach coupled with the interface instability analysis, which offers improvement techniques for the displacement, provide beneficial enhancements for practical industrial applications.

AB  - Abstract This study investigates the failure mechanism of a gallery tunnel. The case tunnel, built for No. 8 highway in the 1990s in eastern Taiwan, was damaged successively in 2008 and 2009. The slope above the tunnel collapsed and destroyed the tunnel more than 20 m. A great number of rock wedge with debris piled upon the damaged tunnel. Field investigation based on the ISRM suggested method regarding discontinuity in rocks indicated that there are three dominant discontinuity sets near the tunnel. However, the slope above the tunnel is steep and high, and the variation on attitudes of discontinuities were concerned for subsequent analysis. As such, a ground-based LiDAR was utilized to acquire global coordinates of the slope near the tunnel, and high precision and high density point clouds were obtained accordingly. The attitudes of fracture planes on the slope were analyzed and the stereo geographic projection analysis was used to determine the number of dominant discontinuity sets and their attitudes. A statistically hypothesis testing method was applied to examine the representativeness of the interpreted attitudes of discontinuity sets. After that, the spatial locations of wedges observed on the slope were determined accordingly. Based on the attitudes and spatial locations of rock wedge above the tunnel, the mechanism and possible influence factors that are associated with the failure of tunnel are discussed. Stability of the tunnel is also evaluated accordingly. 1. Introduction The tunnel is a most durable structure in all kinds of geological engineering structures, which often has a hundred years or more in service life cycle. However, the gallery tunnel near 168k of No. 8 highway was damaged successively twice. The date of first damaged was near September 24th, 2008, the landslide volume was about 2,500 m3 (Fig. 1, red area) and it caused gallery tunnel damaged about 20 m; the date of second damaged was near October 9th, 2009, the landslide volume was about 54,000 m3 (Fig. 1, blue area) and it caused gallery tunnel damaged again.

AB  - While designing a development plan for a field that was underneath a city, major engineering and design stumbling blocks were encountered for the extended-reach drilling (ERD) prototype. There was also the risk of encountering shallow gas and high concentrations of hydrogen sulphide gas across different formations in the field. Hence, the biggest challenge for the field development plan was to develop a well construction design that would provide well integrity and at the same time allow running casings and completions to the desired depth. In addition, different hole sections were experiencing well control, loss circulation, and wellbore stability issues all at once, resulting in a loss of well integrity or total lost circulation. This was making torque and drag unmanageable, which meant inability to drill, run conventional or drillpipe conveyed wireline logs, or run casing and completion. Also, there was a high incidence of stuck pipe events due to wellbore stability issues and hole cleaning problems in a lost circulation scenario. Due to the torque and drag limitation, performing a sidetrack was not an option in the field. In this operation, an extensive offset well analysis and comprehensive risk assessment was done to put together an innovative well construction design and a customized drilling procedure that would lead to successful drilling and completion of a world-class ERD well under high-to-total loss circulation scenario. The selection criterions for technologies for the BHA and the drilling procedures were based on the specifics of designs and highlighted how a predrill geomechanics modeling, a drilling liner application, fit-for-purpose equipment selection, optimized well placement, judicious casing flotation, advanced logging-while-drilling technology application, and tailored drilling practices that not only made an undrillable well drillable but also set a new industry limit to run smart-completions.

AB  - ABSTRACT The Chi-Chin coastal park, located near Kaohsiuug harbor, was built from 1993 to 1997 in southern area of Taiwan. Due to the heavy wave induced settlement inside the park from beach to Art Square during June 1997, the continued soil loss not only endangered the park area, but also resulted in some ground settlement around the area in front of the Office and Travel Center within the park zone. In this paper the failure mechanism will be discussed and analyzed using the model of fluidliquefaction. It is found that some area should be liquefied apparently under given parametric conditions. Furthermore, liquefaction resulting from wave loading leads to reduction of passive soil pressure and causes slope slide instability. INTRODUCTION The Chi-Chin coastal park, located near Kaohsiung harbor in the Southern Taiwan and built since 1993, was proposed to be finished and be opened to public in December 1997. However, during June 1997 and after a strong typhoon, there exists severe loss of soils behind the installed PC soil-retaining wall and then pavement settlement near the soil-retaining wall occurs suddenly. The problem was temporally treated but loss of soils continued to occur. There are a lot of factors which might cause this phenomenon: long-term change of coastal beach, typhoon induced sea wave loads, inadequate choice of type and length of soil-retaining wall, lack of preventing treatment on soil embankment, irregular tidal forces, groundwater movement, seashore hydrological variation, etc. Among these factors the wave induced movement and separation of soil particles behind the soilretaining wall seems to be the most impoaa.nt one that cause the loss of soils. Although there were literatures in the past depicted that dynamic wave loading might lead to liquefaction failure caused by increase of pore water pressure

AB  - ABSTRACTThree slug types were found in the new lab experiments carried out in a 2” flowline-riser system with 477 litre volume operating at ambient pressure: severe slugging of type I (which has a liquid slug length larger than the riser height), severe slugging of type II (having a liquid slug length smaller than the riser height), and small scale slugs initiated in the flowline that prevent the severe slugging cycle. Slug predictions with the OLGA model are in good agreement with the experiments, as well as with other experiments for similar, but smaller, configurations described in the literature. The model also agrees with the severe slugging cycle of the Gannet system in the North Sea. The lab experiments show that gas lift mitigates the type I slugging cycle, but it does not fully remove it. Experiments for gas lift with the type II severe slugging cycle show that the cycle is removed if the superficial lift gas velocity is above 0.75 m/s. No effect of gas lift is found for the experiments where the severe slugging cycle was absent anyhow due to hydrodynamic slugging in the flowline. The OLGA predictions for the effect of gas lift for the three slug types are in reasonable agreement with the lab experiments. Particularly the experiments and simulations show that gas lift is not very effective for slug control.

AB  - AbstractAn efficient approach to wellbore stability analysis and management of shale instability by taking into consideration the dominant instability mechanism(s) has been developed. The mechanism(s) is dependent on the type of shale, in-situ stress environment and drilling fluid system used. These factors determine whether a drilling fluid program can be developed using a mechanical (stress-induced) wellbore stability analysis or complex time-dependent drilling fluid-shale interaction and thermal mechanisms need to be taken into account.A range of wellbore stability analytical tools for efficient management of shale instability is presented. A pragmatic approach to use drilling fluid design charts together with a shale property database and property correlations for designing optimal drilling fluids to manage shale instability efficiently is described. The utilisation of the tools is demonstrated through a field case study in which strategies are developed to control wellbore instability in horizontal wells. Parametric analyses conducted demonstrate the effects of shale and drilling fluid properties on time-dependent wellbore (in)stability. They highlight the conditions in which the drilling fluid-shale interaction mechanisms are critical and need to be incorporated in the analysis.P. 165

AB  - ABSTRACT:The paper presents a constitutive relation of rock media and weak surfaces taking strain softening and permeation softening into consideration. It provides a general formulation of the instability theory of rock system due to softening of rock media and weak surfaces. It is applied specifically to the stability analysis in rock engineering. RESUME:Get article presente la relation constitutive pour la masse rocheuse ainsique pour les surfaces de faiblesse qui est applicable au cas de l'adoucissement dû au deformations et au cas de l'adoucissement occassione par l'ecoulement de l'eau. On propose une formulation generale de la theorie de la instabilite du systeme rocheux occassionee par l'adoucissement et s'applique au calculs de stabilite dans la genie geotechnique.ZUSAMMENFASSUNG:In diesem Artikel werden die konstitutiven Gleichungs-systeme fuer Fels mit weichen Zwischenlagen unter Beruecksichtigung des 'strain-softening' Verhaltens und der Sickerwasserströmung aufgestellt. Es wird eine allgemeine Instabilitatstheorie des Felssystems mit weichen Zwischenlagen vorgestellt und Beispiele fuer deren Anwendung bei der Analyse der stabilitat von Projekten des Felshaues gebracht. 1. INTRODUCTIONThe strength (or yield limit) of a rock medium and a weak structural surface may decrease with the development of plastic deformation and water permeation. These phenomena are called strain softening and permeation softening respectively. Landslide, collapse and subsidence of rock engineering project due to excavation, water permeation or the action of the earthquake force can be regarded essentially as the loss of stability of rock system due to softening of rock media and weak surfaces. In order to discuss these instability phenomena by means of solid mechanics, this paper presents a constitutive relation for rock medium and weak surface taking strain softening and permeation softening into consideration. It also incorporates the incremental analysis of solid mechanics together with an energy criterion for determining the stability of a rock system. Thus it provides a general formulation of the theory for the instability of rock system. The theory can be used to calculate the critical load (water load or the excavation step at which the project would become unstable) of an engineering project and to study precursories of oncoming instability of the rock system, so that it provides a necessary basis for the design of an engineering project to have sufficient resistance against disaster. The paper also illustrates the implementation of the theory in the finite element program NOLM and its application to the stability analysis of rock slopes and underground openings. 2. A CONSTITUTIVE BELATION OF ROCK MEDIUM AND WEAK SURFACE IN A ROCK MASSIn uniaxial tests or triaxial tests under low confining pressure with an ordinary testing machine, the rock medium fails suddenly in a brittle manner, but with a stiff testing machine one can obtain a continuous stress-strain curve including both the hardening range and the softening range. In plasticity theory, when the yield stress of a medium increases or decreases with the development of a plastic internal variable K, they are called strain hardening or softening respectively. Strain softening is an intrinsic property of the rock medium. On the other hand, most rocks have porosity to a certain degree and pore water has a significant effect on the deformation character and the strength of a rock mass. Permeation of water will decrease the strength (or the yield limit) of rock media (e.g., the cohesion So and the internal friction coefficient μ). This is called permeation softening. On the contrary, drain~ age will result in hardening. The elasto-plastic constitutive relations accounting for strain softening has already been established (Wang and Yin, 1981). In order to extend these relations to the case of permeation softening, we have to make use of the concept of effective stress. It is the stress acting on the solid skeleton of the two phase fluid-solid model. In order to describe the discontinous properties of joints, faults and weak structural surfaces in a rock mass, we introduce the concept of a displacement discontinuity surface. Due to the complexity of its behaviour (e.g., it has both dilation and softening) it is necessary not only to set up the discontinuity conditions for the stress and the displacement but also to establish a constitutive relation which relates the stress vector a acting on the surface with the displacement discontinuity vector (u) across the surface. In doing so, we look upon the discontinuity surface as the limit of a material layer when its width approaches zero (Fig.l). This discontinuity surface is not a simple geometric surface but a surface consisting of material particles and possessing material properties.

AB  - AbstractHole instability is one of the serious problems adversely affecting drilling efficiency and costs. Generally, it occurred in different forms as: shale instability, unconsolidated formation eroded by mud flow . . . etc. The shale destabilization is the worst type of hole instability.In Upper Zakum drilling operations, shale instability is the dominant while drilling troublesome shale sections. The major shale sections are through Nahr Umr formations and thin shale streaks in Laffan, Halul, and top part of Thamma-I formations.This paper is primarily focused on shale instability encountered while drilling ZADCO wells in Upper Zakum field offshore Abu Dhabi. It presents an investigation and engineering analysis of the main causes and different mechanisms of shale instability; chemical interaction, mechanical deformation. The chemical shale destabilization occurs due to the chemical reaction between the reactive clays and incompatible drilling fluid formulations. This reaction leads to the dispersion of reactive shale minerals into the drilling mud. On the other hand, the mechanical destabilization of shale may result from the unbalanced formation pore pressure, hole deviation, drilling practices, even in the absence of reactive shale. The related troubles encountered while drilling the problematic shale section are; excessive torque and drag on connection and while tripping, mud solids build-up and consequently unsteady drilling fluid rheology, stuck pipe, and hole enlargement that results in poor cement jobs.Stuck pipe has costed ZADCO millions of dollars due to non-productive operational time involved in stuck pipe, fishing jobs, and side-tracking resulting from stuck pipe.Detailed analysis of drilled wells and observations along with the result of laboratory tests show that hole instability due to chemical destabilization can be improved by utilizing compatible drilling fluid formulation and good quality mud chemicals, and optimizing mud rheology. To minimize hole troubles due to mechanical destabilization of shale; it requires proper pre-planning of the wells and careful implementation of the best practice are the key issues. Hole instability needs an integrated solution including; well trajectory, mud weight and formulation, design of bottom hole assemblies, mud solids removal, . . . etc. The main objective is to stay out of the trouble better than get out of trouble or prevention is always better than cure.IntroductionIn this study we concentrate on the hole instability troubles experienced while drilling the troublesome shale intervals in Zakum field wells. Upper Zakum field is considered one of the largest offshore fields worldwide discovered offshore Abu Dhabi in 1963 as shown in Figure-1.While drilling the recent wells, either new or re-entry, we experienced severe shale related drilling problem resulted in a significant lost rig days and spending millions of dollars for unnecessary operation of fishing, and sidetracking due pipe sticking through the shale intervals.

AB  - Abstract VAPEX (vapour extraction) is a promising technique for the recovery of heavy oil and bitumen reservoirs, especially for cases where steam-assisted gravity drainage and other thermal recovery methods are not economical. In the VAPEX process, a solvent is injected into the reservoir to reduce the oil viscosity and mobilize it towards the production well. CO2-based VAPEX is an attractive option from both economic and environmental perspectives. In CO2-based VAPEX, unlike other hydrocarbon solvents, dissolution of CO2 into the oil can result in a density increase of the diluted oil. As a consequence, the diluted oil has a higher density than the immobile oil beneath and a gravitationally unstable diffusive boundary layer is induced, which may lead to natural convection. In this study, a mathematical model for the diffusive boundary layer in the CO2-oil contact region in the VAPEX process is developed and the possibility of convective mixing occurrence is examined using linear stability analysis, based on the amplification of the initial velocity perturbations. It is found that in field-scale cases in the VAPEX process, the Rayleigh number is much smaller than the critical Rayleigh number, (Rac), and natural convection cannot happen in this process. Introduction The world's total reserve of heavy oil and bitumen is about six trillion barrels, which is about six times the amount of conventional resources(1). A major part of these resources are in Canada, Venezuela and the United States. Most of these reserves are at such depths that open-pit mining cannot be used economically, and in situ methods have to be used to reduce the viscosity of the oil-in-place and mobilize it. Either thermal methods or non-thermal methods can be used to recover these reserves. The viscosity of oil is a strong function of temperature and decreases sharply with increasing temperature. Currently steam-assisted gravity drainage (SAGD), a thermal method, is a popular scheme for the recovery of heavy oil and bitumen and has been successfully applied in several fields. Despite the success of this process for some reservoirs, there are many reservoirs that SAGD cannot be applied due to excess heat loss, which makes it uneconomical to operate. In thin reservoirs, the need for steam increases and the steam-to-oil ratio (SOR) is prohibitively high. Many oil and bitumen reservoirs have a bottom aquifer, and heat loss to the water can make the process unfeasible(2). There are also reservoir conditions where SAGD may not be applied, such as when water saturation is high or porosity is low. In cases where SAGD cannot be applied, VAPEX is an option for the recovery of these resources. The initial development of the VAPEX process was first introduced by Butler and Mokrys(3) as a solvent analogue to steam-assisted gravity drainage. The steam chamber in SAGD is replaced by a solvent chamber in VAPEX. In the VAPEX process, a solvent is injected near its dew point (where both solubility and diffusivity of the vapour solvent into oil are at their maximums) and forms a solvent chamber within the reservoir(4).

AB  - ABSTRACT:Two phase flow in a model of a vertical open fracture developing over an underground cavern is experimentally studied by the use of a Hele-Shaw cell. Finger type infiltration occurs in the large gap width part of the cell. The influence of fingers, which are formed around the cavern, on the initiation of gas leakage is mainly investigated. It is found that fingers tend to decrease the critical gas pressure at which gas in the cavern starts to leak into groundwater.

The motion of the interface between gas and water in an open fracture should be detaily studied to make clear the mechanism of the flow. An open fracture can be simplified as a narrow space between two parallel plates (Hele-Shaw cell). Therefore, many previous authors have studied the characteristic nature of this motion on the basis of the stability analysis of flow in the cell to a small disturbance given on the interface ( Saffman and Taylor (1958), Phillip (1975), White et al. (1977), Park and Homsy (1984)). Recently, Tryggvasson and Aref (1983) suggested a technique to numerically simulate the deformation of the interface. Åberg (1977) proposed a practical technique to prevent the gas leakage from an underground cavern, based upon the theoretical study of the initiation of the upward movement of a small gas bubble in an open fracture. However, many unsolved problems on the nature of the two phase flow are remained yet. The present authors tried to basically clarify the pattern of this flow around an underground cavern by the use of a new type of the Hele-Shaw cell. 2 FLOW CONDITION CONSIDERED AND EXPERIMENTAL APPARATUSA vertical open fracture which connects between the surface layer overlying a impervious rock mass and an underground cavern is considered (see Figure 1(a)). This Figure presents the crosssection cutting at right angle to the longest axis of the cavern. The surface layer is composed of high permeable soil and highly weathered part of rock mass. It is assumed that the strike of this fracture is identical with the direction of the longest axis of the cavern and that the groundwater table exists in the surface layer. The cavern is filled with air. In usual, the gap width of an open fracture is not uniformly distributed along the fracture and differs from place to place. This gap width in the part near the cavern may be larger than it in the other part because of the stress release occuring around the cavern. Now, an open fracture of which gap width stepwise increases from d1 to d2 at a certain depth of L1 measured downwardly from the surface of the rock mass is considered (Figure 1(b)). In this Figure, He is the height of the groundwater table measured from the bottom of the surface layer and Hois the sum of L1 and He. The two phase flow in this type of an open fracture is fundamentally studied. The experimental apparatus used in the study is schematically shown by Figure 2. This apparatus is a vertical Hele-Shaw cell having a storage tank on it and an air box at the lowest part of it. The cell and the air box simulate an open fracture and a cavern, respectively. This apparatus is made of acrylic plate.

AB  - IntroductionProblems related to wellbore instability remain a major source of non productive time while drilling, soaring significantly the operational expenditures. Several factors are at the back of wellbore instability, some are the derivative of the regional geology and could not be modified, these as the in situ stresses, the pore pressure and the formation(s) strength(s). Others are the operator's responsibility such as the mud weight, chemistry and flow rate, the casing program and the well trajectory, and might be changed if necessary. More importantly, there are cases where wellbore instability problems could not be fully avoided; improved hole cleaning procedures might be the only way of managing such problems.The causes and impact on drilling of wellbore instability could be summarized as follows. When a well is drilled, the stresses originally supported by the removed material are redistributed on the rock around. In the post drilling configuration, the deviatoric stress, which is the difference between the major and the minor principal stresses, is maximum at the borehole wall. Plastic rocks creep onto the wellbore, reducing the well diameter. Long periods of reaming/ back reaming might be needed while tripping in/out through such geometrical restrictions. Most of rocks, however, display a rather brittle behavior. So, a brittle material tends to fracture as soon as the stress nears its strength. Invasion of the fractures and erosion of the rock fragments by the mud follow the rock disintegration around a wellbore. Beyond a critical well inclination1, big cavings settle forming a bed on the low side. This bed restricts the movements of the drill string increasing the risk of getting stuck.Four stress regimes prevail in the underground depending on the ratios of the two horizontal principal stresses to the overburden stress. Among these three principal stresses, the maximum horizontal is the most difficult to determine. In the past, methods mostly based on core testing (DSA, ASR, paleo-magnetism) were used to estimate such a stress. More recently, the analysis of the figures of borehole failure, i.e. breakouts and drilling induced fractures, was proposed as a technique to determine the tectonic stress direction and magnitude2,3.In ABK field, located offshore Abu-Dhabi, no dramatic problems are encountered while drilling into reservoirs belonging to the Thammama and Arab groups (depth TVD < 2300 m), except in the Nahr-Umr shales, the wells being drilled routinely with a mud weight lower than 1.2 SG. At those depths, the stress corresponds to a strike-slip faulting regime with a minimum horizontal stress close to 1.63 SG. Recently, severe wellbore instability troubles occurred while trying to drill horizontal drains in the Hamlah-Gulailah formations with the same mud weight. A rock mechanics study was carried out to identify the causes and find out a remedy to such problems. So far, only two nearly vertical wells could be drilled in the field. Therefore, limited data were available for determining the stresses that included oriented calipers, master logs, pressure and rate records from an acid fracture job and a core.Several breakouts were identified on the calipers, their sizes vary from small (long axis/well radius < 1.2 and breakout width < 60°) to very large (long axis /well radius > 1.8 and width > 130°). Some intervals are, however, in gauge. A minimum horizontal stress of 2.44 SG was determined using pressure record during an injectivity test realized prior to the acid fracture operation. Triaxial tests were performed on core samples to measure their strengths. Some intervals of the core were fractured, more or less intensively, while others were intact. This explains the strong scattering of the unconfined compressive strengths with values ranging from 55 to 1700 bar, although the most frequent value is 300 bar in average. Most likely, the largest breakouts occur in the softer, most fractured intervals while the strong sections remain perfectly stable. Breakouts dimensions and orientations together with strength values were introduced in the software SFIB(c)4, which permitted to constrain the magnitude and the direction of the tectonic stress. The stress regime was found to be at the frontier between thrust and strike-slip, with major horizontal stress acting NE-SW. The existence of regional tectonic stresses was confirmed from the observation of breakouts in other fields. Finally, the estimated stress and strength values were used to calculate the optimum mud weight versus well trajectory.In parallel, DSA tests were performed. The results were not truly reliable. This fact confirms that the techniques of stress measurements based on core testing should be handled with great precaution.

AB  - ABSTRACT: Wellbore instability has been registered and expected as one of the risks for successful delivery of horizontal injectors with open-hole stand-alone screens in depleted reservoirs. Special drill-in fluids and breaker fluids were designed to ensure stability of these wells prior to screen installations. Borehole collapse was expected in most cases after the wellbore pressure dropped to hydrostatic at the end of the drilling process. Unlike open-hole producers, the loose particles (or grains) trapped in the annulus of the open-hole injectors will likely undergo constant mixing and resorting during each injection and shut-in cycles. In this study, we examined the impacts of grain mixing on the reduction of porosity and permeability in the annulus using a simple binary mixing model. Our preliminary results suggest that if the fines are 10 to 20 times smaller than the larger particles, the presence of a few percent in volume fraction of fine particles can reduce permeability by an order of magnitude.1. INTRODUCTIONHorizontal wells with open-hole stand-alone screens have been the preferred well and completion designs for water injectors across the Shell Deepwater portfolio in recent years. Wellbore instability has been registered as a significant risk for drilling these horizontal injectors especially in depleted reservoirs. One of the key challenges during the drilling phase for some of these wells is to manage the potential risks between wellbore instability and severe mud loss due to fracture gradient reduction. Numerous studies and efforts have been made to ensure successful delivery of these wells. While majority of these wells have been drilled and completed successfully, some of the injectors have experienced lower than expected injectivities upon start up. Their damage mechanisms are often attributed to poor water quality, water hammer effects, emulsion, intra-well crossflows, shear failures or fluidization in the formation. However, wellbore instability will likely occur once the stand-alone screen is installed and during the subsequent injection shut-in cycle as downhole pressure is reduced to hydrostatic. The collapsed formation along with other fines can be mixed and repacked in the annulus to create a permeability barrier that could lead to the observed injectivity reduction. In this study, we investigated the plausibility of this new impairment mechanism by evaluating the impact of particle mixing on porosity and permeability reduction in the annulus region of the injector.

AB  - ABSTRACT:Water pressures were measured on and in the sea bed at a sand beach. Basic statistical and spectral properties of measured pressures are shown. The field of porewater flow is estimated based on those properties. Also is discussed the relation of the flow to the change in levels of sea water surface. It is shown, as a conclusion, that, in a shallow zone, porewater can flow upwards in the vertical direction with hydraulic gradient larger than its critical value and sands can lose their weight under certain conditions of waves and the local shape of the sea bed. INTRODUCTIONStability of sea beds is concerned with such a wide range of geotechnical problems as the stability of large scale offshore structures, reclaimed lands in coastal areas, and so on. This study is addressed to the problem of beach erosion, which is one of the main subjects of coastal engineering but has rarely been approached from the point of soil mechanics. Beaches can erode and their shore lines can regress inland, which can be considered a natural, long-term cyclic process that beaches experience. But, recently, once the coastline regresses, the recovery of the original coastline is often very difficult in many countries. Several reasons for this can be cited, for example, 1. River control structures, such as dams, which have been construct~d along rivers flowing to the bay, may reduce the supply of soil sediments. 2. Port and harbor facilities may cause the change in the current and wave conditions, and consequently supply of sediments will be decreased. Furthermore, in the near future, the sea level will rise with the rise in the temperature of the earth. It is an important concern to protect beaches against their erosion.

AB  - AbstractThis paper addresses the problem of instability and sand production in poorly consolidated sandstones subjected to a water influx. New phenomenological evidences were collected in a series of unprecedented experiments, improving the understanding on the sand production mechanisms. Two different groups of experiments studied behavior, morphology, and stability of sand arches in two-phase saturated sand samples. The effects of changes in fluid flow velocity and water saturation were deeply analyzed, and the distributions of porosity and water saturation in the arched region were mapped during the sand production process.The results showed that single-phase saturated sands did not develop enough cohesive strength to support a stable arch and sand was produced massively, generating a high-porosity and unstable zone. However, a small increase in wetting-phase saturation developed enough cohesive strength to stabilize an arch, reducing sand production. Within a defined range, a progressive increase in wetting phase saturation did not impact arch stability and sand production was sporadic and minimum. As the wetting-phase saturation exceeded critical value instability occurred; the arch was enlarged and massive amounts of liquefied sand were produced. A decrease in the non-wetting phase flow rate did not affect the stability of the arched zone and reduced sand production. Finally, it was observed that dilated, unconfined and agglomerated blocks of sands, with uniform porosity and wetting-phase saturation, filled the space inside the arched region. IntroductionIt is estimated that seventy per cent of the total world's oil and gas reserves are found in poorly consolidated reservoirs. Troublesome solids production areas are most commonly found in younger tertiary sediments, particularly the Pliocene and Miocene. However, solids production can occur in any other group of reservoirs, if the limits of rock strength and deformation are reached during drilling, production, injection or completion operations. Solid production in a production system is always noted with considerable alarm due to its potentially catastrophic effects. Solids contents can cause severe production limitations, equipment damages and environmental problems and requires prediction and control.Despite the great effort to improve the techniques for prediction of solid production, field practices have been demonstrated that quantitatively accurate prediction of volumetric solids production needs yet to be developed, especially for poorly consolidated sandstones. Existing models can predict the on-set of sand production and analyze cavity stability and rock failure envelopes. However, they cannot predict the volumetric production of sand over time as a function of the applied stress, fluid flow rates and changing in local water saturation. Because sanding is a complex phenomenon, significant assumptions and simplifications need to be done to obtain and interpret field data. Major sources of errors2 in sand prediction models are due to oversimplification of physical phenomena - neglecting physical parameters, oversimplification of the mathematical models - neglecting unknowns, and errors in the input data. New approaches and techniques have been used to improve the accuracy of the predictive models. Large-scale experiments3,4,5,6 and X-ray computed tomography7,8,9 have been used to enrich the understanding of sand production phenomena in laboratory. These experimental techniques analyze in more detail the effects of perforating, changes in pore fluid saturation and mechanisms of particle detachment.

AB  - Abstract Various field operators and developers in the Eastern Mediterranean are reliant on the development of export pipeline routes that ascend the eastern portion of the Nile submarine delta. Evidence of numerous complex slope instability events and other geohazard processes across the submarine delta front mean that risk mitigation in this region needs careful considerationprior to installation. This paper focuses on integrated site characterisation including detailed sedimentological logging and two-dimensional (2D) geomechanical modelling of slope stability for a recent project on the eastern portion of the Nile submarine delta, with focus on four distinct palaeolandslide features on the delta slope region. Based on the review and integration of geophysical, geological and geotechnical datasets, all four palaeolandslides appear to have failed in a translational manner along a shear surface at approximately 6 m below seafloor. The shear surface coincides with the presence of a strong impedance reflector mapped in sub-bottom profiler data. This reflectorcorrelates well with a sampled occurrence of an approximately 1 m-thick silty sand bed (sedimentological FaciesN2), bounded above and below by extremely low to very low strength organic clay sediments (Facies N1). Eleven radiocarbon tests were performed in the palaeolandslide evacuation surfaces and the resultant mass transport deposits. These test resultsindicate that the four events occurred between approximately 500 years and 1600 years before present, with a best estimate age of 800 years before present (i.e. 12th century AD). The 1068 AD Gulf of Aqaba earthquake or the 1202 AD Lebanon earthquake are possible triggers for the palaeolandslides and relict seafloor morphology. Deterministic 2D slope stability analyses were performed along four slope profiles to output values for factor of safety (FOS) against slope failure. The analyses modelled present-day slope stability, and a reconstructed (pre-failure) seafloor to further understand the characteristics of the four observed palaeolandslides. The modelling showed that the slopes are stable under presentday conditions, even under abnormal level event (ALE) seismic loading. The modelling also showed how faulting plays a key part in overall slope stability: some faults buttress upslope sediments and thus increase the slope FOS, whereas in other casesthe faults steepen the overall slope and result in a lower slope FOS. The key uncertainty in the slope stability modelling is the poorly understood lateral geotechnical variability of Facies N2, which variesfrom silty fine sand to sandy silt, and the complex and currently uncharacterised behaviour of Facies N2 under cyclic seismic loading. It is possible that the variable fines content governs whether Facies N2 behaves in a drained or undrained mannerduring seismic loading, and how much strength degradation (i.e. liquefaction) may occur. All these factors could contribute to the stability of the slope during earthquake loading.

AB  - ABSTRACT:An efficient approach to the management of wellbore instability in shales is presented. It takes into consideration the factors which determine the degree of complexities required in developing mud weight program to provide the required effective mud support with time. A range of design and analysis tools required for wellbore stability analysis is described systematically. The application of some of the tools is demonstrated through two field case studies to develop strategies to control shale instability in wells drilled in the North West Shelf of Australia. The tools provide a practical means of opfimising the approach in developing the solution, including drilling fluid design (weight, type and chemistry), to manage shale instability efficiently.INTRODUCTIONWellbore instability, experienced mainly in shale sections, may be induced by either in-situ stresses that are high relative to the strength of the formations (stress-induced) or physico-cbemical interactions of the drilling fluid with the shale or a combination of both (Tan & Willoughby 1993, Mody & Hale 1993, van Oort et a1.1995, Last et al. 1995, Tan et al. 1998). The dominant stability mechanism(s) is dependent on a wide range of factors including type of shale, in-situ stress environment, thermal gradient and drilling fluid system. Hence, for efficient management of shale instability, the significance of the factors should be assessed, and the most efficient approach adopted on a field by field basis.This paper describes an efficient approach to the management of shale instability. It takes into consideration the factors which determine the degree of complexity required in developing a mud weight program to provide the required effective mud support with time. A range of design and analysis tools required for the stability analysis is described systematically.

AB  - Gas-injection EOR has good displacement efficiency but poor sweep efficiency. Foam can improve sweep efficiency in these processes, but its direct injection would not be practical due to its poor injectivity. Field results suggest that the well injectivity can be improved if gas and surfactant solution are injected in alternating slugs, leading to foam creation inside porous medium at their (gas and surfactant) contact. This process, referred to as Surfactant Alternating Gas (SAG), aims at reducing gas mobility at the displacement front. Behind the front, because of low water saturation, foam collapses (partially or completely); thus, gas mobility gradually increases to its original mobility at the injection well. This can potentially lead to fingering of the highly-mobile gas into the region with low-mobility gas in the form of foam. To the best of our knowledge this phenomenon has not been reported in the literature, apparently due to poor grid resolutions employed in the numerical simulations and/or focus on other parameters, from which it is difficult to infer instabilities. In this paper we use a local-equilibrium foam model to simulate a SAG process with high grid resolution simulations. The magnitude of the instabilities decreases with weaker foam, decreasing grid resolution, increasing diffusion, and inclusion of capillary pressure, suggesting that fingering reflects the intrinsic physics of the process and importantly, it is not a numerical artifact. In a successful SAG process, as long as there is enough surfactant ahead of the gas bank to form a region with low mobility, the fluid ahead of it will be efficiently displaced (i.e., stable front exists). In numerical simulations, however, this could cause extremely low discrete mobility values in some of the grid blocks located at the front. In such a process, there can be fingering within the foam bank (unstable displacement), while the foam front appears relatively stable. This work is the first of its kind, i.e., such an unstable front has never been reported in the literature. Further studies are required to verify if the unstable displacements are physics-driven, or due to numerical artifacts at the front with sharp gradients. Our results have practical implications, especially in calculation of the well injectivity and design of optimum slug size and foam strength in a SAG process.

AB  - Abstract Thaw subsidence can damage the infrastructure including buildings, roads and airfields founded on ice- rich permafrost, increase their maintenance costs, change the landscape and influence the sustainable development in the northern region. Information about the ground movements is important for making decisions on various geotechnical approaches to reduce impacts of permafrost degradation. However, field measurements of ground movements and long term monitoring using traditional field survey may be logistically expensive in vast and remote Northern Canada and Alaska, USA. The ability to measure surface displacements, identify the areas being impacted, and provide information of seasonal timing using remote sensing techniques would improve the knowledge and expertise of those involved in infrastructure engineering and management where permafrost is degrading. Traditional Interferometric Synthetic Aperture Radar (InSAR) measurements of deformation do not consider the effects of seasonal freeze-thaw, thus may not effectively reveal the long term trend of ground movements in permafrost region. In this paper we propose to quantitatively evaluate the seasonal ground movements resulted from on-going seasonal freezing and thawing, and estimate long term deformation of linear infrastructure in permafrost area using InSAR technique. The proposed approach has been tested on Alaska Highway built on permafrost at Beaver Creek, Yukon, Canada using Radarsat 2 data acquired during 2013-2015. Results indicate that there was long term deformation at a rate of five cm/year, in addition to an average of magnitude of vertical movement of 4 cm between winter heaving and summer thawing during annual climate cycles.

AB  - ABSTRACTA new experimentat technique for the investigation of drilling-fluid induced borehole instability in shales is introduced. Pressure transmission transients are used to study pressure penetration in shales, the latter being a main shale-destabilising mechanism. The pressure transmission method provides a powerful tool for the fundamental study of shale-fluid interactions and for development of improved water-based mud formulations to promote borehole stabilisation in shales. The capabilities of the method are illustrated by permeability measurements made in low-permeability shales. In addition, a wide range of conventional and new mud systems is screened and the shale-stabilising performance of these systems is assessed. It is argued that the strategy for promoting borehole stability in shales through improved mud formulation should be based on maintaining pressure isolation between wellbore and formation.1. INTRODUCTIONBorehole instability in shales is a prime technical problem area in oil- and gas-well drilling. Costs for the industry spent on shale stability problems have been estimated at $500 million/year. Shale drilling is notoriously difficult when using water-based drilling fluids, which are now replacing technically superior, but environmentally unacceptable, oil-based muds. Past efforts to improve water-based fluid formulations for shale drilling have been hampered by an imperfect understanding of the fluid properties required to prevent the onset of borehole failure. Recent studies of shale-fluid interactions [1-4], however, have revealed many of the underlying causes of borehole instability and have suggested a new approach to water-based mud design. This development has been aided by a growing awareness that the design of improved water-based muds greatly benefits from laboratory techniques that can realistically simulate downhole shale-fluid interactions. As a result, new downhole simulation techniques are replacing inaccurate and outdated techniques in drilling fluid rerearch. This paper introduces a new technique based on pressure transmission measurements, for monitoring fluid transport and associated pore-pressure effects in shales.2. DRILLING FLUID INDUCED BOREHOLE INSTABILITY IN SHALESShales are heterogeneous, low-permeability media of which the matrix consists to a large extent of clays. The forces that act on a shale system can be divided into mechanical and physico-chemical forces. The former include the in-situ stresses, the pore-pressure and mechanical forces in the cementation that may develop in response to tensile or corressive loading. The physico-chemical forces in the clay parts of the shale include the well-known van der Waals force and the double-layer repulsion. Also, at small platelet distances, a variety of short-range forces become important, e.g. oscillatory- and structural forces (for a recent review, see ref. [5]) All physico-chemical forces combined give rise to the ‘hydration stress', which usually is repulsive and has a well-defined direction between two clay platelets. In the inhomogeneously distributed ensemble of clay particles and other shale materials, the preferential direction of the hydration stress is usually averaged out. The hydration effects are then described in terms of a scalar quantity: the ‘hydration pressure'.

AB  - Abstract Borehole instability problems such as stuck pipe, hole enlargement causing poor hole cleaning, and deviation control often arise in the build sections of horizontal wells drilled from surface or as re-entries from existing vertical wells. A drilling fluid system with optimized density, fluid loss, and clay inhibition properties can usually be selected to eliminate or reduce the risk of costly lost time. The selection of such a fluid system depends upon the characteristics of the shales, the in-situ stress state, the planned well trajectory and other well design criteria. This paper reviews the principal causes of mechanical and chemical instability in shales located in build sections and demonstrates several practical software tools and techniques for designing such wells. One international and two Western Canadian field examples in different types of shale will be presented. Introduction Borehole instability during the drilling, logging, completion and production of a well has become an important concern for many operators planning horizontal and deviated wells. The use of traditional, conservative completion techniques for vertical wells is being challenged as operators attempt to reduce well costs and still derive the improved productivity and reservoir access offered by these wells. Recent technical innovations include the use of underbalanced drilling techniques, slimhole completions, re-entry wells with openhole build sections, and multiple laterals from a single vertical or horizontal wellbore. In applying these techniques, there are often issues posed during the well planning stage where the risk of hole collapse in the short or long term must be addressed. In many cases, the selection of an optimal strategy to prevent -or mitigate the borehole collapse might compromise one or more of the following other elements of the overall well design: the rate of penetration; the risk of differential sticking; drill cuttings and mud disposal options; hole cleaning; hole size, and consequently the completion and stimulation options available; formation damage risk; stimulation requirements; and the ability to log the hole. In many cases there may be insufficient experience with a given reservoir and the desired completion, hence the prior performance of vertical wells cannot be used, by itself, to guide the well design. This paper describes how borehole stability analysis can be used to design the build section of wells and mitigate the risks of hole collapse or lost circulation. A PC Windows-based software package called STABView™ has been developed for analyzing all types of borehole instability and sand production risk.

AB  - SummaryThe problem of cuttings transport in the inclined sections of extended reach wells (ERW) is a major concern in the oil-well drilling industry. This article presents an innovative time-dependent mathematical model, along with a computer implementation of it, which is based on the well-known two-layer model approach. An innovative feature of this model consists in the consideration of the added amount of solids that comes from the crumbling and cave-in of the wellbore. The unstable effects of this added amount of solids is taken into account through a variable representing the added volume of cuttings per unit time and length. A finite volume approach is used to solve the system of differential equations. The paper represents a first step on the integrated analysis of cuttings transport and wellbore stability problems. IntroductionThe strategy of using ERW is being adopted worldwide as an attractive way of developing oilfields. Cuttings transport and wellbore stability are critical aspects in the drilling of highly inclined extended reach wells through unstable shales, which may be exposed to the drilling fluid during long time. These two problems are addressed by two classical sciences (two phase flow and rock mechanics) and treated separately. The study of steady-state stratified solid-liquid annular flows has been the subject of several researchers in the last decades1-3 in an attempt at describing the complex phenomena involved in the cuttings transport in high angle wells. On the other hand, considerable research effort has been conducted in the past aiming the quantification of mechanical4,5 and chemical6,7 effects which may cause wellbore instabilities. The main objectives of this paper are to introduce some ideas about the dependence of these two problems and to quantify the removal of solids generated by wellbore instabilities. The tool for this development is a computer program for the evaluation of cuttings circulation based on an innovative time dependent model for cuttings transport simulation. The computer program can calculate the variables which govern cuttings transport for the highly inclined section of an extended reach well, considering other source of solids besides the bit. Using the computer simulator, a series of analysis is performed in order to quantify the effects of the main variables as well as of the subtle increase of solids a given section of the well in the time-dependent behavior of cuttings transport. Cuttings Transport Simulation and the Two-Layer ModelThe two-layer model has been originally proposed for the representation of drilled cuttings transport in high angle wells,8 based on the good results of this approach for the simulation of other industrial processes, such as specific gas-liquid flows,9 and hydraulic transport of solids in pipes.10 The model proposed by the authors is illustrated in Fig. 1 and is based on the following hypothesis: The bottom layer represents the cuttings bed, which deposits in the annulus due to the action of gravitational forces. In this layer a fixed solids concentration of 52% is assumed. The top layer only contains the carrier fluid. There is no slip between the solid and liquid phases in each of the layers. There is no mass transfer between the solid and liquid phases. The solid-liquid system is incompressible and its rheological parameters are the same of the fluid. The height of the interface between the two layers is constant in the annular section studied and, consequently, a hydrostatic distribution of pressure in a cross section is assumed. The solids are characterized by an average diameter and by their sphericity. This model8 can be formulated by a system of two algebraic equations, based on momentum conservation laws for the bed and the fluid layers. The solution for the two unknowns, bed height and friction losses, require iterative approaches due to the nonlinearity of the system. Martins11 expanded the previous model, considering solids in the upper layer and four different flow patterns in the annulus: stationary bed, moving bed, heterogeneous suspension and pseudo homogeneous suspensions. The model is an adaptation of the proposal of Doron et al.12 for annular flows. This model is formulated by a system of four algebraic and one integral equations based on mass conservation laws for each phase, momentum conservation laws for each layer and a turbulent diffusion concept to describe solids distribution in the upper layer. This model has became the basis of PETROBRAS cuttings transport simulator which is widely used in the design and troubleshooting while drilling complex trajectory wells. Several improvements were made to the model, based on the feedback from field operators. Such improvements include specific correlations for interfacial stresses prediction,13 corrections for rotation effects,2 use of different rheological models for characterizing the fluid flow14 and the introduction of a permeability equation to describe flow through the bed.14Among the changes in the basis model, proposed by Gavignet and Sobey,8 the introduction of a solid phase in the upper layer and the inclusion of an equation for liquid flow through the bed showed negligible difference in the final results. For this reason, these changes will not be kept in the time-dependent formulation. All the others proved to be very useful for the adequate representation of cuttings transport while drilling high angle wells. An expressive contribution was given by Nguyen and Rahman15 by the introduction of the three layer model concept to the analysis of cuttings transport. This concept, also brought from the hydrotransport industry16 may be useful to improve the understanding of the role of rheology on cuttings transport. The Time-Dependent FormulationThe present work consists on a first step on time-dependent solid-liquid stratified flow modeling. The concept of the two-layer model is kept, but now, unlike any previous approach for cuttings transport analysis, transient conservation laws are derived to describe the phenomena. Eccentricity is an input parameter in the model. It directly affects all the area and perimeter expressions, as described in Gavignet and Sobey.8 Eccentricity can be predicted by mechanistic models17,18 using commercial softwares.

AB  - ABSTRACT: Maintaining wellbore stability remains a challenging task in the oil/gas well drilling industry, especially for wells drilled through naturally fractured shale formations. Field evidences show that some wellbores that are stable immediately after drilling may collapse after several days of exposure to the drilling mud, resulting in significant financial losses. Thus, a better understanding and prediction of the time-dependent wellbore instability behavior in naturally fractured shale formations is of high demand. In this paper, we present a poro-elasto-plastic finite element model for predicting the progressive evolution of damage zone around the wellbore drilled in naturally fractured shale formations. The Mohr Coulomb model has been employed to capture the plastic behavior of the naturally fractured shale formations, while strength reduction caused by the penetration of drilling mud into the formation is also included in the model. Permeability enhancement due to stress damage before peak strength has been experimentally tested and an empirical relationship between the permeability enhancement and the damage state has been obtained and incorporated into the model. As an example application, the model has been applied to a typical wellbore drilled in the Bohai oilfield of China, where serious wellbore instability problems have been frequently encountered when the fractured shale formations of Dongying group is drilled through. The influences of drilling fluid density and plugging capability of the drilling fluid on the time-dependent wellbore stability were investigated. Some suggestions for maintaining long term wellbore stability in these naturally fractured shale formations have been provided.1. INTRODUCTIONIn spite of decades of efforts and significant technological advancements, wellbore instability is still a notorious problem in the oil and gas well drilling industry, causing loss of hundreds of millions of dollars per year (Rahman et al., 2000). It has been reported that most of the wellbore instability events occur in shale formations, especially the naturally fractured shale formations, which justifies further research to pursue better understanding of the stability behaviour of wellbore drilled in shale formations and more efficient wellbore stability prediction models.

AB  - AbstractThis work presents the analysis of a borehole instability case at 2km in a seal formation within the oil field environment. Field observations of severe borehole instabilities are given. The factors causing this instability are observed as being due to cyclic mud pressure loading, drilling induced damage, wellbore orientation and fault set intersection at the wellbore.Borehole breakout data both from image logs and calliper data has been used to determine the in-situ stress field. The minimum principal stress magnitude has been obtained using leak off testing, extended leak off testing through the analysis of borehole breathing during drilling with losses. The data has been analysed using non-parametric statistical techniques to determine the complete stress tensor. Fault property and in-situ rock mass data has been obtained from triaxial and shear box testing.For this study the distinct element method (UDEC) has been used in 2D to study the wellbore stability under dynamic (fluid flow) conditions. Factors taken into account include fault, fracture and bedding surface orientation, fracture parameters, in-situ stress conditions, cyclic mud pressure loading, initial drilling induced damage and well bore orientation. The study has investigated the behaviour of a synthetic rock mass containing low permeability rock blocks separated by low to very low permeability joints.It has been observed that all parameters influence the level of stability but using a prolonged delay in mud pressure reduction, stability can be maintained, also it is possible to select optimum wellbore orientation in advance using the numerical procedures.IntroductionThe aim of this work is to investigate borehole instability in fine-grained fractured lithologies. These lithologies act as reservoir seals in a series of deep petroleum wells in the Timor Sea. The project results presented herein test the hypothesis, that cyclic mud pressure loading at the wellbore significantly influences stability. The paper goes on to present results that describe the degree of damage caused by such cyclic loading and the effect of joint permeability on cyclic loading damage.

AB  - ABSTRACT:The stability of rock slopes is known to be controlled by the geometry and strength of discontinuities, and amongst several rock mass features, the discontinuity orientation has the principal influence on instability phenomena. In this paper, a method is presented for the evaluation of discontinuity orientation data such that these data may be used in stability analyses. This method is a procedure for the robust statistical interpretation of discontinuity orientation data using the actual form of the data; this contrasts sharply with classical analysis using discontinuity orientation contour diagrams. Fuzzy partitioning algorithms have been applied to discontinuity orientation data, and membership levels - representing "degree of certainty" - are computed directly from the data without the use of an assumed analytical function. These membership values are then directly used in the computation of the factor of safely of sliding wedges. This new approach appears to show advantages over the classical statistical analyses, where models fitted to real data are used in the analysis. In addition, the use of fuzzy partitioning algorithms has been found to offer an improved analysis, as degree of certainty is immediately applicable in an engineering context.RESUME:La stability des talus rachises est. lie aux caracteristiques geometriques et de resistance des discontinuites naturelles, I'orientation etant Ie facteur d'instabilite Ie plus important.

With probabilistic methods, it is possible to calculate the probability of failure of a system depending on the combinations of parameters, and to quantify the potential risk of a geotechnical construction (Trunk, 1993, Muralha et al., 1993).

AB  - AbstractConstruction of mountain roads at western Saudi Arabia is a challenge, where the rock masses are high-rising, steep slopes. Al-Hada mountain road of almost 22 km long shows many incidents of rockfalls. A studied 100 m long portion of mountain road lie along a man-made and natural sharp slope cut suffers from slope failures, rockfalls incidents, mainly in rainy seasons. The igneous rock masses are medium quality. The 40 m-height rock slope-cut along the road has no benches. The steep man-made rock slope cut is very close to the road, forming a potentially source for rockfalls. The Swedge, Roctopple, and RocFall computer program utilized to perform modeling and mitigation of the rock slope. No remedial measures taken to prevent the debris flows to take place. Input parameters such as block size, seeder point’s locations of blocks falls, slope angle, restitution coefficients, and slope roughness used to model the rock mass characteristics such as strength, bounce height, kinetic energies, and translational and rotational velocities. Modeling of the input parameters indicates the increase of the hit energy and end-point of rockfalls as the block size and slope angle increases. 1. INTRODUCTIONThe slope failures, landslides and rockfalls frequently occur along mountain roads in rugged terrains. One of the most difficult terrains in western Saudi Arabia is the Al-Hada descent (Fig. 1). The famous Al-Hada descent lies at the upstream high elevation region of Wadi Na’man in the western part of the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia (KSA), which known as Arabian Shield. The elevations at the top of the Al-Hada road reach almost 2,000 m a.m.s.l. and its alignment lies within the sharp cliff edges of the Sarawat Mountains at the highest elevations. Before ascend the road starts from about 500 m elevation and reaches to more than 2,000 m, in a number of road twists.

AB  - SummaryAn accurate finite-element simulator with a very fine 2D grid was used inthis study of viscous instabilities. The simulator has negligiblegrid-orientation and numerical-dispersion effects and treats longitudinal andtransverse dispersivities separately. The simulator was validated by comparingnumerical results with the analytical solution for unit-mobility-ratio miscibledisplacements under varying longitudinal and transverse dispersivities and wasfurther tested by simulating the results of published laboratory displacementsunder adverse-mobility-ratio conditions. A good match was obtained between thesimulated and experimental results for recovery and effluent-concentrationprofiles for adverse-mobility-ratio displacements. A permeability variance ofonly 0. 1 or an inlet concentration perturbation for a homogeneous system wasenough to initiate the effects of viscous fingers seen in laboratorydisplacements.Results showed that the parameters that control unstable displacements arethe permeability variance (Dykstra-Parsons coefficient), the size ofheterogeneity (scale length), the mobility ratio, and the dimensionlesstransverse Peclet number, Npet. It was concluded that the instabilitiesincrease with increases in the permeability variance, the scale length, and themobility ratio. With increased instability, the recovery decreases and thebreakthrough time decreases. For Npet, less than 0.01) the displacement remainsunstable. In addition, the effect of longitudinal dispersivity is negligible.As long as the parameters (mobility ratio, permeability variance, and size ofheterogeneities, Npet, less than 0.01) permeability variance, and size ofheterogeneities, Npet, less than 0.01) were the same, the effect of the size ofthe modeled medium on recovery and effluent profiles was insignificant. Thisimplies that the effects of viscous instabilities can be scaled within therange of parameters investigated.IntroductionOil displacement by miscible flooding processes, including CO2 flooding, isaffected by instability at the flood front caused by an adverse mobility ratio.An unfavorable-mobility-ratio displacement coupled with the heterogeneity ofthe porous medium results in viscous instability (fingering), which in turnaffects the displacement efficiency of multiple-contact-miscible processes,sweep efficiency, breakthrough time, and slug-size design.Our previous investigations showed that the effect of small-scaleheterogeneity of the porous media on the displacement front can be representedby an effective dispersivity. The investigation, however, was restricted tounit-mobility-ratio displacements. The purpose of this investigation is toextend the previous analysis to purpose of this investigation is to extend theprevious analysis to adverse-mobility-ratio (greater than unity)displacements.Extensive literature is available on the phenomenon of viscous fingering.The literature can be divided into three categories: analytical, experimental,and numerical. Analytical work involves the mathematical description of theinception and modeling of fingers and the method to scale fingers to fieldconditions. Experimental work involves laboratory core experiments underadverse-mobility-ratio conditions. The numerical work relates to differentsimulation techniques that are used to predict and simulate the physicalbehavior of the viscous fingers.Most of the previous numerical work concentrated on matching theexperimental laboratory data for adverse-mobility-ratio displacements. Some ofit matched the data of Blackwell et al. in sandpacks; others matched their ownexperimental data. The numerical techniques used varied from finite-differencesimulations to the method of weighted residuals to random walk models. Most ofthese investigators were reasonably successful in matching experimentallaboratory data, indicating that the physical phenomenon of fingering can bemimicked by simulators if appropriate precautions are taken. Chief among theseare the use of a large number of gridblocks, minimization of grid-orientationeffects, and proper initiation of viscous fingers.In addition to matching experimental data, some investigators conductedsensitivity studies to investigate the effect of various parameters on viscousfingering. Detailed simulations by Giordano et al. and Moissis et al. indicatethat mobility ratio and scale length of heterogeneity significantly affect thecharacteristics of viscous fingers. An increase in either of these twoparameters accentuates the instability of the viscous fingers. parametersaccentuates the instability of the viscous fingers. Although numericalinvestigations in the last few years have remarkably improved the physicalunderstanding of viscous fingering, some questions still remain unanswered.First, can the effects of laboratory-observed viscous fingering on displacementperformance be modeled? Second, how is a viscous instability affected byvarious parameters including mobility ratio, permeability variance, size ofheterogeneities, and rock dispersivity values? permeability variance, size ofheterogeneities, and rock dispersivity values? And third, can the viscousfingering be scaled? This paper addresses these questions.To address these questions, several assumptions were made: the displacementwas contact miscible, the gravity effects were negligible (densities ofdisplacing and displaced phases were identical), and the permeabilitydistribution for small-scale heterogeneities was log-normal. In addition, asshown in Fig. 1, a linear (strictly rectilinear) displacement was conducted inwhich 2D flow effects were captured.Amoco's finite-element simulator, modified to include both longitudinal andtransverse rock dispersivities, was used for this investigation.ApproachA three-step approach was taken in this study. First, the finite-elementmodel was modified and validated with analytical solutions and the literatureexperimental results. Second, with the same model, mechanistic aspects ofviscous instabilities were investigated. Third, the effect of differentvariables on recovery and effluent profiles was analyzed to provide insightinto scaling of viscous fingers.The effects of various parameters on viscous instabilities wereinvestigated. These parameters (Table 1) include longitudinal dispersivity(rock dispersivity), ratio of transverse to longitudinal dispersivity,permeability variance (Dykstra-Parsons coefficient), scale length (size ofheterogeneity), mobility ratio, spatial permeability distribution, and size ofthe modeled medium. The longitudinal values were chosen on the basis of theavailable literature evidence. The mobility-ratio values chosen represent atypical range of mobility ratios observed for miscible-displacementprocesses.To define the permeability heterogeneity, it is necessary to characterizetwo parameters-permeability variance and scale length. The permeabilityvariance characterizes the extent of heterogeneity, whereas permeabilityvariance characterizes the extent of heterogeneity, whereas the scale lengthcharacterizes the size of heterogeneity. In this study, the permeabilitydistribution was assumed to be log-normal.

AB  - Abstract Under-Balanced Drilling (UBD) practice is an optimized drilling approach, aiding in more reservoir recovery, too. Considering long-period production from some of Iranian oilfields and their correspondent pressure decline, it seems more necessary to replace UBD with the Conventional Overbalanced Drilling (OBD). Utilizing UBD in one of Iranian low-pressure fields named here "S" field however improves Productivity Index (PI) of the wells drilled besides minimizing drilling challenges and increasing Rate-of-Penetration (ROP) but extremely increasing risk of wellbore instability. This paper presents wellbore stability assessment of three layers of Mishrif reservoir using common reservoir data, correlated in-situ stress regimes and rock mechanics parameters based on its lithology & regional data. By employing a computer modeling software, stability limitations of the borehole as optimized Equivalent Circulating Density (ECD) were specified through the Finite Difference Method (FDM) and Mohr-Coulomb criteria. By applying the results of this modeling, about 6000 ft of 5 wells in "S" field was drilled with good hole condition and negligible instability problems while mentioned benefits of UBD was preserved. Introduction Economical conditions lead to apply various technologies in oil and gas industry. One of these technologies is drilling in underbalanced condition. Application of UBD technique has increased significantly which currently 30% of wells drill with this method. In underbalanced condition, the pressure due to circulation fluid is less than formation fluid pressure. Thus UBD requires special equipments and operational instructions to control the formation influx. However, UBD has remarkable advantages including: Increase in rate of penetration (ROP) and bit life Decline drilling fluid loss Improvement of formation evaluation Decrease in pipe stuck occurrence. Moreover, primary stimulation decreases or can be eliminated and more production will achieve. Higher drilling cost, safety problems and wellbore stability have to be considered for UBD. Different UBD techniques are: drilling with air, gas, mist, stable foam, unstable foam and aerated mud. These fluids are used with back pressure. Notwithstanding many benefits there were some worries about utilizing underbalanced drilling which the premier of all is wellbore instability, because when back up hydrostatic pressure inside wellbore decreases, wellbore is exposed in risk of collapse and caving. In case of "S?? oil field Underbalanced drilling make much cost reductions due to improved bit life, eliminating the need for reservoir stimulation and minimizing loss of rig time due to eliminating differential sticking  problem and  higher rate of penetration but so many wellbore instability problems occurred. This study investigates the wellbore instability problem and probable solutions via adjusting equivalent circulating density (ECD) of drilling fluid in hole.

Introduction An oil retention boom has served for many years as a useful device to contain or to divert an oil slick. Many different forms of the boom have been developed and it has been studied in considerable detail both analytically and experimentally. It is well known that, under certain circumstances, the boom may fail to contain the oil; one such reason is the relative motion between the oil and water. Under such circumstances the oil layer thickens somewhat upstream of the boom forming a so-called head wave, and, as has been observed by several investigators, the instability of the interface begins there. This instability consists of ripples which form at a certain value of the water current; they grow as the water current is increased and eventually break producing oil droplets which escape under the boom.

AB  - Abstract Mass transfer plays a key role in affecting the efficiency of solvent-based processes in enhanced oil recovery. The mass transfer is usually very slow because of the pure molecular diffusion. However, it can be greatly enhanced by frontal instability when solvent is injected to displace oil. Under unfavorable mobility contrast, the interface between two fluids may become very convoluted as displacements continue. This therefore increases the contact area and leads to more efficient mixing. It is necessary to accurately simulate the detailed frontal instability and its propagation with time in order to investigate its effect on the mass transfer. Most of previous numerical simulations assumed a constant diffusion coefficient (CDC) in solvent-based processes. However, experimental studies on the mixing between two miscible fluids indicated that the diffusion coefficients actually vary with concentration or viscosity. Moreover, some numerical simulations with commercial simulators also showed that using the CDC may result in very high and unrealistic values when matching the oil production rate. In present study, a concentration-dependent diffusion coefficient (CDDC) is considered in which the diffusion coefficient is exponentially proportional to concentration. Highly accurate nonlinear numerical simulations are conducted to simulate the frontal instability under unfavorable mobility ratio between solvent and oil. The effect of injection rate and mobility contrast on frontal instability and mass transfer is examined, and the breakthrough time for the CDDC case is discussed. For better comparisons, the CDC case is presented to more clearly show the effects of CDDC.

AB  - Solvent-based processes have great potential to enhance oil recovery. The injected solvent is able to significantly reduce the viscosity of the oil and improve its mobility. In displacement processes, the frontal instability happening at the interface between solvent and oil can increase their surface contact area, while it also leads to earlier breakthrough time and less sweep efficiency if such instabilities develop too severely. Especially at very large mobility contrasts, the less viscous injected solvent can easily bypass the highly viscous heavy oil. Most of the previous studies on simulations of frontal instability are restricted to a small range of mobility ratio. In the present study, we adopted a highly accurate numerical method to simulate the detailed development of solvent fingering at extremely large mobility ratios in fully miscible displacements. At certain conditions, the case with a maximum mobility ratio as large as 22026.5 could be successfully modeled. This allowed analysis of the flow dynamics and mass transfer at such a large mobility contrast in miscible displacement processes. The breakthrough time and sweep efficiency at breakthrough were also investigated at small and extremely large values of mobility ratio through numerical simulations. With an increase in mobility ratio, the breakthrough time decreased, first very rapidly and then slowly. The breakthrough time varied as a power relationship with the mobility ratio for various Peclet numbers. Similar relationships were found for the sweep efficiency versus mobility ratio. This approach would be helpful for the accurate prediction of breakthrough time and sweep efficiency in miscible displacement under extremely large mobility contrasts.

AB  - Abstract The idea explored is that gas lift may be stabilized by imposed oscillations. This has been experimentally investigated in a scaled-down facility where water is lifted by air. An air-tank provides compressibility emulating a gas filled annulus. Depending on pipe dimension, injection rate and tank volume, the flow may be stable, or oscillate similarily to casing heading in full-size wells. To control natural oscillations, their dominating frequency was firstly determined. Destructive interference was then imposed by cyclic variation of either the downhole injection valve, or the tubing outlet valve. By injection valve regulation, the flow was stabilized and 40% higher liquid rate obtained. Outlet choke regulation also stabilized the flow, but rate improvement less, up to 13%. Scaled-down facilities should be viewed with sobriety. However, the facility appears to exhibits static and dynamic behavior similar to real wells, so the experimental results may be lent some credibility. This may provide a new and simpler approach to control of gas lift instability.

AB  - Abstract Taking drilling beyond the continental shelves further into the great depths of water leaves the drilling industry with no option of avoiding reservoirs lying beneath great masses of salt formations. Presently, salt formations trap rich reservoirs in Brazil, West Africa, Gulf of Mexico, North Sea and off the coasts of eastern Canada. The discovery of producible reserves beneath vast, thick sheets of salt formations challenges the regular drilling and completion practices, making every operation a unique experience. Drilling through salt formations can become successful only when the essential properties of salt formations (e.g. halites) that may cause instability are clearly understood. Instabilities in salt formations arise from the ability of the salt to flow under loading conditions (creep) and the ability to dissolve at certain conditions and elevated temperatures (solubility). This paper presents the checklist of essential contributing properties that must be accounted for in modeling creep- and solubility-induced instabilities in salt formations. These properties are classified under the physical, mechanical and structural sub-headings, and the values of these properties for deepwater subsalt formations are provided for use in creep and solubility predictive models. This paper is based on well design approach i.e. begin  the planning from the depth of location of the salt formation, that is, the salt formation becomes the starting point, working backwards to the surface and forward to the target reservoir. Temperature response, melting point, solubility, thermal conductivity, octahedral shear stress, solubility, creep, anisotropy, density, friction, hardness, strength,  fracture gradient, permeability are some of the properties analyzed in this paper and their influencing parameters in order to develop an all-encompassing model for used in drilling through alt formations. In addition, this paper examines the application of the essential properties to the geo-mechanical studies of salt formations. The case study of this research is the design of an exploratory well in the Gulf of Mexico where properties of the salt formations: crystal structures, salt dissolution, creep, temperature and pressure response determined the drilling fluid composition, cement slurry, and casing design.

AB  - Summary In the completion of oil and gas wells, successful cementing operations essentially require the complete removal of the drilling mud and its substitution by the cement slurry. Therefore, the displacement of one fluid by another one is a crucial task that should be designed and optimized properly to guarantee the zonal isolation and integrity of the cement sheath. Proper cementing jobs ensure safety, whereas poor displacements lead to multiple problems, including environmental aspects such as the contamination of freshwater-bearing zones. There are a number of factors, such as physical properties of fluids, geometrical specifications of the annulus, flow regime, and flow rate, that can remarkably affect the displacement efficiency. The shape of the interface plays an influential role during the displacement process. For a highly efficient displacement, the interface has to be as flat and stable as possible. However, unstable and elongated interfaces are associated with channeling phenomena, excessive mixing, cement contamination, and, consequently, unsuccessful cementing operations. Thus, the stability of the interface between the two fluids has major importance in cementing applications. In the present work, a novel method for the prediction of interface instability and displacement efficiency is introduced. Instability analyses of the interface between the two fluids are carried out following the main ideas of the original Rayleigh-Taylor (RT) and Kelvin-Helmholtz (KH) instabilities. Moreover, with the same analyses, optimized designs for the improvement of the displacement process in any specific situation can be proposed. The influence of density, rheological properties, surface tension, and flow rate of the fluids on the instability and shape of the interface, and consequently on the displacement efficiency, is studied. The 3D-computational-fluid- dynamics (CFD) simulations are performed with commercially available CFD software to study several displacement cases. To validate the results, numerous experiments were conducted for fluids with various combinations of physical properties and operational conditions. For one of the inefficient displacement cases, an optimized design is provided on the basis of a study of the instability of the interface, and the improvements are validated by CFD simulations. The results present the effect of fluid properties, geometrical configurations, and flow rate on the instability of the interface and displacement efficiency. A reasonably good agreement between the results of all approaches presented in the paper is observed, and they all emphasize the importance of the proper selection of fluid properties and flow rates for any specific sequence—to minimize the degree of contamination and mixing. The discussions and results of this work provide insight into the displacement process, beneficial guidelines for industrial applications, and compelling evidence of the importance of correct predictions and appropriate designs of the displacement of fluids in cementing operations.   Erratum Notice: This paper has been modified from its original version to include erratum SPE-180322-ER (https://doi.org/10.2118/180322-ER); correction to Eqs. 9, 10, 11, A-2, and A-6.

AB  - AbstractHalokinetic processes acting in the Bryant Canyon Area have intensely modified the topography into a series of intra-slope basins, and have led to the genesis of a great variety of slope instability processes. Sediment cores, and seismic records from four basins were studied extensively in order to determine the nature and sedimentological patterns of the sediment failures; most of the slope instabilities appear to occur mainly during low sea-level stands, whereas during the Holocene only a few isolated and small-scale sediment failures developed. Mud-flow and mud/clast dominated debris flow deposits are the most prominent features in the sediment cores. Deposits are characterized by a basal-uniform to shearlaminated zone that represents the deposition of a basal lubrication zone reducing bottom drag of overflowing debris flows allowing them to run as Bingham flows for several kilometers. In some cases the lubricated zones were totally passed over by the overriding debris flows, and resembling the lubricants left behind in the wake of a slug. Convoluted/distorted laminations in debris/mud flows reveal that in a final stage the heads/margins of the debris/mud flows evolved into 'creeping-like' masses that resulted in an obstacle to the forward transportation of the flow body, leading to the genesis of successive imbricated zones behind the head of the flows.IntroductionDebris flows are gravity-driven flows of highly concentrated sediment/water mixtures, displaying diverse properties, behaviors, and depositional characteristics.1 The geometry, shape, morphological and internal structure of debris flow deposits are primarily determined by the type of flow (Bingham vs. inertial grain flow, hydroplaning vs. nonhydroplaning flows, etc.), nature (cohesive/incohesive), concentration and grain-size of the sediment particles, concentration and size of transported clasts, and the topography of the area in which they evolve and are eventually deposited.1,2,3 Deposition by debris flows is caused by "freezing" of the flow when the applied stresses fall below a threshold value (yield strength) that leads to en masse deposition, initiated at the front of the flow.1,4,5,6,7,8,9 However, many researchers have been arguing that based on field observations and experimental data, it is more probable that debris flow deposits result from an amalgamation of deposits in successive surges, occurring in a single flow event.1,2,10,11Subaireal and submarine debris flows display very different characteristics and flow mechanisms due to their propagation by different means, the later being able to flow much faster and for longer distances than the former.3,12 Although extensive studies have been conducted on recent, submarine debris flow and mass transport deposits through seismic data and sediment core collection and analysis, little is know about their internal structure that can be highly variable even in flows consisting of similar sediments.7,11This paper presents the results of detailed sedimentological analysis of five Jumbo Piston cores (up to 15 m long), in combination with high-resolution seismic information of the sampled areas, from the Bryant Canyon Area. The main purpose of this study is to provide better insight into the interaction between diapiric tectonics and slope instabilities, and to determine the nature and sedimentological patterns of sediment failures.

AB  - Abstract The importance of the geomechanical modeling and wellbore instability analysis is increasing in the petroleum industry with recent growth of drilling plans in unconventional reservoirs. Recently, a large majority of field developments are occurring in shale oil and shale gas reservoirs as a novel source of energy. Many of these reservoirs are thin and highly layered, anisotropic and naturally fractured; these make their geomechanical modeling and wellbore instability analysis remarkably crucial; subsequently a good understanding of elastic properties of the formation such as Young's modulus, Poison's ratio and in-situ stresses are necessary for accurate results. Bakken Formation is one of the major unconventional plays in North America which is identified by three distinct members: layered upper and lower shale and fractured middle dolomite. The thin beddings within the formation have made them extremely anisotropic, which originates from the platey shaped clay particles, high kerogen content plus the existence of natural fractures thus the wellbore instability analysis and modeling of this formation has become highly challenging. For this study elastic properties along with the petrophysical values are collected and reported from several numbers of core plugs along with wireline log data. Then, these values are used as input parameters in poroelasticity equations to calculate the magnitude of the principal stresses. Finally instability analysis especially in the inclined section of the well is carried out. Finite Difference 3D numerical modeling was conducted under Mohr-Coulumb failure criterion with anisotropic assumptions to evaluate the deformations around the wellbore to locate instable regions. In addition, the effects of different inclination angles of the wellbore versus depth were studied. Results indicated a strong relation between the magnitude of the wellbore deformations with the the drilling inclination angle changing from vertical to horizontal which takes place in the direction of maximum horizontal principal stress. Stress contours are plotted around the wellbore shows zones of higher stress concentration and deformation. Various type of failure regions are developed as well.

AB  - ABSTRACT: Carbonate reservoirs are characterized by extremely heterogeneity full of microcracks and vugs in it. It also presents anisotropic property of water filtration in terms of distribution of microcracks and void space. Incidents are common practice when drilling through carbonate formation such as loss circulation and borehole breakout. In drilling through fractured carbonate formation in North China, excessive volume of cavings accompanied significant volume of mud loss. To better understand the mechanism of this instability, both laboratory experiment and numerical simulation are conducted. The laboratory mechanical testing provides insight for the bearing capacity of carbonate rock and assists calibration for numerical modeling. Discrete element method (DEM) is used in this study to establish wellbore model. To characterize the anisotropy of pore space and microcracks, smooth-joint contact model is used. In addition, hydraulic flow in microcracks and matrix in the model is coupled with mechanical analysis. Discrete element-based hollow wellbore model is validated with analytical solution to gain reliability on the modelling. After running a specified time, the modeling results show that no fracture is induced in this incident, but significant mud loss is observed.1. INTRODCUTIONCarbonate reservoirs are known globally as an important source for hydrocarbon resources, and more recently as potential carbon dioxide storage sites. Carbonate reservoirs (limestone or dolomite) are made of materials such as shell or coral. These reservoirs are characterized by a matrix with a low permeability and heterogeneities such as fractures and voids. In the oil deposit exploitation, water injection method is widely used to balance reservoir pressure. When water is injected into reservoir in case of the lack of fracturing, the direction of injected water flows in the formation is determined by the direction of predominant rock pore channels. This anisotropy of filtrations along different directions is common in sedimentary rocks and occur in carbonate rocks as well (Kuzmin et al., 2011). The effect of anisotropy of filtration is always present and particularly revealed in large-pore and cavernous interlayers of carbonate rocks. This anisotropy is poorly studied due to the complexity of its evaluation.

AB  - AbstractUnderbalanced drilling techniques have been applied to avoid or mitigate formation damage, reduce lost circulation risks, and increase the rate of penetration. However, drilling with a bottomhole pressure less than the formation pore pressure will usually increase the risk of borehole instability due to shear or tensile failure of the rock adjacent to the borehole. The extent of rock failure is very sensitive to the pressure in the annulus between the drill pipe, collars or BHA and the formation. The capacity of the drilling fluids to effectively circulate cuttings and cavings to surface is also strongly sensitive to the annular flow velocity. This paper describes the coupling of two popular software packages STABView™ and WELLFLO7™ to solve the complex interaction of borehole instability, rock yielding, collapse, detachment, and wellbore hydraulics during underbalanced drilling operations. In particular, a profile of the average borehole diameter can be predicted that accounts for hole enlargement in weak rock formations, and its consequences for annular pressures and flow velocities.The use of these two models running in a coupled mode is illustrated with two examples. The first one is a case study of a sidetracked well that was drilled underbalanced using coiled tubing technology in western Canada. Severe tight hole problems and poor hole cleaning had been experienced during drilling operations, and ultimately the bottomhole assembly became stuck. Subsequent borehole stability analyses indicated that significant hole enlargement was occurring in two weak shaley intervals. Wellbore hydraulics analyses showed that the liquid velocities achieved in the enlarged intervals of this well were low, which led to an accumulation of cuttings and cavings, thus resulting in the stuck pipe. A second, hypothetical horizontal well case is also described in order to illustrate the procedures for characterizing the operating envelope (i.e., optimal annular pressures and flow rates) prior to drilling an underbalanced well. This example demonstrates additional features of the two software programs for simulating the complexities of hole failure, erosion and enlargement in an annulus with a two-phase fluid for both strong and weak rock cases.IntroductionIn underbalanced drilling (UBD), annular circulating pressures are usually kept below the reservoir pressure. This is often done to minimize formation damage, reduce the risk of lost circulation, or increase the rate of penetration. More details on the benefits of UBD have been presented by previous authors1,2,3,4.While UBD offers many potential benefits, drilling with a bottomhole pressure less than the reservoir pressure will generally increase the risk of borehole instability. Previous descriptions of borehole stability analyses for UBD include McLellan and Hawkes5 and Parra et al.6. In many cases, there is a window where the bottomhole pressure is high enough to avoid the problems associated with borehole instability, yet low enough to achieve the benefits of UBD. Evaluating this window is a part of the task facing the UBD engineer.Causes and Consequences of Borehole Instability. Borehole instability is primarily a function of how the rock surrounding a well responds to the stress concentration induced around that well when it is drilled. If the rock is stronger than the induced stresses, then the borehole will be stable. If not, rock yielding and possibly rock collapse, detachment or convergence will occur. Whether or not this will lead to serious drilling problems is a function of many factors, including: Post-failure rock behavior The volume of the detached rock The sensitivity of drilling operations to hole enlargement or convergence Hole cleaning capacity (fluid properties, circulation rates)Causes and Consequences of Borehole Instability.Borehole instability is primarily a function of how the rock surrounding a well responds to the stress concentration induced around that well when it is drilled.

AB  - AbstractIschia Island (Italy) experienced slope instabilities during the Holocene that occurred at different scales, from shallow mass movements up to large rock and debris avalanches. These events were strictly related to volcano-tectonic activity and the presence of a well-developed hydrothermal system and mobilized significant volumes of greenish alkali-trachytic tuffs (Mt. Epomeo Green Tuff, MEGT). Ongoing gravity-induced slope deformations in the Mt. Nuovo region also involve the MEGT over an area of 1.2 km2. In order to constrain geometry and mechanism of this phenomenon, and to highlight possible interactions between the thermo-baric field of the hydrothermal system and stress-strain conditions related to the Mt. Nuovo slope deformations, laboratory tests were carried out to assess and characterize the mechanical behaviour of the MEGT. Physical properties of the MEGT were first measured, including porosity, permeability, and elastic wave velocity. Mechanical characterization was then performed using a combination of uniaxial, tensile, and triaxial experiments on as-collected samples and samples thermally stressed in the laboratory. The obtained results reveal MEGT to have a high porosity and permeability, and that it deforms in a compactant (i.e. ductile) manner at very low confining pressure (i.e. depth). The triaxial tests allow us to derive failure envelopes for MEGT under dry and water-saturated conditions, defining the range of stress conditions for failure.1. IntroductionFlank instabilities represent the most common indirect geo-hazard related to volcanic activities. Destabilization is usually produced by a combination of predisposing and triggering factors. Although magma emplacement or earthquake shaking are the most common triggers able to produce external transient forcing that could interact with inner pressures or accelerate deformations [1, 2], hydrothermal systems may also play a significant role, influencing slope stability in two ways: i) alteration can weaken or strengthen the materials involved as function of PT conditions and the chemical composition of fluids [3] and ii) transiently increasing the stress field within the slope [4, 5, 6]. Such collapses can in turn trigger subsequent hazardous events in a sort of “domino effect” leading to the occurrence of explosive eruptions, triggered by the sudden decompression of shallow magma reservoirs or hydrothermal systems [7, 8] or, in the case of marine volcanoes, destructive tsunami waves [9]. The case study of a gravity-induced slope deformation affecting the edge of Ischia resurgent caldera is presented here; to account for a well-constrained mechanical behavior of the involved lithologies, in view of future multiphysics numerical modelling, a suite of mechanical laboratory tests was carried out.

AB  - ABSTRACT: In recent years, the slope sliding accident not only becomes a major hidden dangers of mine safety, but also causes a huge impact to the normal production of mine. At present, the traditional slope monitoring and early warning methods are difficulty to solve the problem of monitoring and early warning of the long-term landslide mass such as the slope of Baiyun East Ore. This is the biggest hidden dangers and difficulties to the slope of Baiyun East Ore at the moment. In order to achieve the effective monitoring of rock failure events in the inoculation process of slope instability of Baiyun East Ore, this paper introduced the moment tensor inversion method based on digital seismology, calculated the pulse response of transmission medium between the source and sensors (green function), extracted the displacement data of the microseismic events, linear inversed the moment tensor and calculated the fracture azimuth of microseismic events, judged the fracture types of microseismic events (four shear fracture, four mixed fracture), and then built the 3D effect picture of microseismic monitoring area, match the rock failure surface and predict its development trend.1 INTRODUCTIONSlope is a natural or artificial formation of the slope. It is one of the most basic geological environment of human engineering activities, as well as the most common form of engineering project construction. Its formation and evolution has a very close relationship with the human production and activity. As one of the three global major geological disaster, the failure of slope has a serious crisis to people's lives and property. With the progress of human society and the development of world economy, human engineering activity is increasingly frequent, its scale is increasing, and it causes more and more geological fracture. The size of its scale and the complexity of its conditions are unprecedented. Therefore, the correct understanding of slope, the rational survey and design, the proper governance, and losses the disaster caused by the instability and failure of slope to a minimum, is the question must consider for the workers of geologists, geotechnical engineering technology. The form of instability and failure of slope showed mainly sliding, collapse, spalling and plastic flow. The sliding form, that is rock mass deformation and failure of the slope, refers to the specific surface and combination of the surface along the shear failure of slopes (Zhang 2007).

AB  - AbstractSubmarine slides pose the most critical offshore geohazard. Seafloor mass movements occur in continental margins worldwide, and at all scales, from the smallest ones, barely detectable by acoustic methods, to the gigantic Storegga Slide off Mid-Norway. As most deepwater petroleum resources are located in continental slope settings, seafloor instability is a major concern, not forgetting that other geohazards, such as shallow gas, gas hydrates, and mud volcanism also must be assessed.The slope angles in general are small, so the most important factors controlling stability are sediment types and the presence of excess pore pressure. Both are functions of geological setting and depositional regime and history. Two important causes of excess pore pressure in the uppermost sediment layers are high sedimentation rates combined with unfavourable layering, and the trapping and accumulation of gas seeping from deeper levels.Along the high latitude, formerly glaciated NW European margin, the climatically induced variability between glacial and interglacial situations seems to have been the main controlling factor for instability. Excess pore pressures were created in stacked interglacial and glacial units during rapid burial by glacial debris during peak glacial periods. The water source may have been underlying biogenic oozes.Mineralogical factors, such as smectite content, appear to have limited influence here. The major, large scale sliding has also formed seafloor topography with numerous steep local escarpments from which smaller slides may threaten seafloor installations.In lower latitude, river-fed settings the mechanisms are different. In the Krishna-Godavari River delta off East India, the sedimentation rate varies greatly laterally and temporally, often at short time scales. The temporal variations are caused by the long term climatic variations as well as by the seasonal monsoons. In the lower latitude continental margins significant sea level low-stands, such as during the Last Glacial Maximum (LGM), may have caused exposure of the shelf, with erosion and delivery of river sediments directly to the upper slope. Small mass movements (but still large enough to be a significant threat to installations) seems to occur frequently in this setting, partly supported by locally extreme sedimentation rates.IntroductionOffshore geohazards comprise a number of geological phenomena, such as submarine slides, shallow gas and dissociation of gas hydrates, shallow water flow, mud volcanism, and seismicity. Of these, the most serious is probably submarine sliding, which not only has an immediate effect on any seafloor installation in and downstream of the slide scar, but also may have serious third-party consequences if the slide has tsunamigenic potential.Hydrocarbon exploration and exploitation have, over the last decade moved into increasingly deeper waters of the world's continental margins. This also means it has moved into increasingly more slide-prone areas. At the same time, the tools for detailed seafloor investigations have developed immensely, and new areas are mapped at great detail. This again has led to the discovery of submarine slides of various sizes in all margin areas of the world.

AB  - SPE Members AbstractFrontal instability occurs in every phase of reservoir simulation (water flooding, steam flooding, chemical and carbon dioxide flooding) and in multiphase fluid flow. Whenever saturation front changes with time and spatial distribution, S(x,t), the key issue is usually the resolution of the changes of fractional flow curve with saturation (df/dS). That also implies evaluation of the derivative of relative permeability curves with saturation. An analytical technique is developed to evaluate the required derivatives and the results are used to estimate the recovery of gas displacing oil with changes in mobility ratio. The proposed technique can be accurately used to develop an algorithm for fractional flow curves. The technique is very attractive as a diagnostic tool for inquiring into the necessity for extensive reservoir simulation studies and should enjoy popularity with field engineers. BackgroundThe problem of frontal instability is common in reservoir simulation studies involving fluid displacement be it water flooding, steam flooding, chemical flooding, or carbon dioxide flooding and also in multiphase fluid flow. Frontal instability occurs when saturation front changes continuously or discontinuously with time and spatial distribution, S(x,t), during flooding or flow and is caused by barriers and reservoir heterogeneity. Reservoir compositional simulation in particular suffers not only from the fact that S(x,t) has to be solved by numerical differentiation, but also the compositional gradient has to be accounted for by a piece-wise interactive technique of the fugacity constraints. A considerable effort has been made in previous studies to resolve frontal instability by effectively solving S(x,t). But more complete resolution of this problem requires solution of the shock front derivative which is the change of fractional flow with unit change in saturation, df/dS. Many of the basic discussions and solutions of fluid displacements in porous media, miscible and immiscible, have been available for quite some time. Starting with the landmark paper published by Buckley and Leverett in 1942, several other papers, monographs and books have been published on fluid displacements in porous media, including discussions of the encountered difficulties. Some other studies have concentrated on specific problems of fluid displacement in reservoirs subject to gravity drainage drive mechanism. P. 487^

AB  - Abstract Unstable production behavior affects many offshore fields, particularly at their decline stages. "Casing heading?? and "density wave?? are two types of instability that have been identified and both can result in production loss. These instabilities have influence on each other, but the interaction has not been fully addressed yet. One contribution of this paper is to study the interplay of these two phenomena. For this purpose, key variable of density wave phenomenon; pressure at injection point in tubing that is governed by an integral equation; is considered as a fourth state variable added to 3-D dynamical model of casing heading. Another contribution is some modifications on the casing heading and density wave dynamic models. Finally, the proposed model is simulated in MATLAB® and OLGA®, and the results are compared with well operation facts and data from field. Introduction Modeling and analysis of two-phase flow through vertical pipes have gained considerable interest in recent years [1, 2]. Especially, simplified versions of two-phase flow model has application in stability analysis and stabilization of gas lifted oil wells [3-5]. Figure 1 shows a typical diagram of a gas-lifted oil well. In this technology, gas is routed from the surface into the annulus and then injected deep into the tubing in order to be mixed with the fluid form the reservoir. This reduces the density of the fluid in the bottom-hole and hence the production rate from the low pressure reservoir is increased [6]. A flow model is derived in [7] directly from equations of momentum and enthalpy balance laws in inclined pipes for calculation of pressure and temperature profile of gas production systems. This model has been applied to simulate the various types of pipe in gas production. This model has also been used for modeling of two-phase flow in gas lifted oil wells [8]. In [3], a three-dimensional first-order linear model is obtained and solved with Laplace transform. The resulting characteristic equation is used for stability analysis. In [9], a linear three-dimensional state-space model is proposed in which tubing pressure, fluid flow rate from reservoir and gas flow rate constitute the state variables. In [4], model of gas injection system is described by Darcy-Weisbach equation and formula of orifice flow for adiabatic conditions. Then reservoir model is described using inflow relationship for a reservoir in which both single-phase and two-phase flow can occur. Finally reservoir model and well model are coupled to complete the mathematical model. Gas-lifted oil wells often become unstable at their decline stages. There are several different phenomena to account for the instability behavior in oil and gas wells. The fluctuating and sometimes chaotic unstable production behavior affects many offshore fields. The hazardousness of the fluctuations to operation safety and smoothness has been warned and the production reduction due to the instabilities has been widely addressed. Two types of instabilities, "casing heading?? and "density wave?? instabilities, which both can result in production loss has been reported in [10]. This work addresses this issue by attempting to derive a mathematical model that can well describe the instabilities. A simplified model that describes the well behavior in casing heading phenomenon is presented in [6, 11]. It consists of a three dimensional nonlinear state space model. Mass of gas in annulus, mass of gas in tubing and mass of oil in tubing are the corresponding state variables, that we will discuss it. But, the second state variable is eliminated in [12] and a two dimensional model is used. For density wave instability, a distributed parameter model, that is described by an integral is presented in [5, 13]. Also, in [5] model of density wave and 2-D version of casing heading is used for predicting instabilities in gas lifted oil wells. But, interaction between the two types of instability is not fully considered. In the proposed density wave model, constant value of separator pressure is considered as well head pressure and pressure gradient is calculated based on it. In practical situation, well head pressure is not constant because of casing heading phenomenon. In this work, we present some modifications on density wave model to be suitably jointed with a modified version of 3-D casing heading model.

Introduction The purposes of this paper are to present theoretical and experimental evidence for occurrence of macroscopic instabilities in displacement of one viscous fluid by another immiscible with it through a uniform porous medium and to compare available experimental data with some predictions of a theory of instability developed by the first author. The instabilities are referred to as macroscopic in the sense that spatially quasi-sinusoidal, growing fingers of the displacing liquid are formed, the width and peak-to-peak separation (wavelength) of which is large relative to a characteristic length of the particular permeable medium such as grain size. Visual models of two kinds have been used to obtain observations: displacement of oil by water-glycerine solutions through the flow channel formed by closely spaced parallel plates and displacement of oil by water with and without initial interstitial water through unconsolidated glass powder packs, employing the technique of matching indices of refraction. In all cases we have observed macroscopic instabilities or fingers under conditions predicted by the theory to be favorable for their occurrence. The phenomenon discussed here is not the production of streamers due to gross inhomogeneities such as permeability stratification of the porous medium.It is our object to show, on the contrary, that a quantitative prediction of finger spacing is possible in a porous medium known to be macroscopically homogeneous and isotropic throughout. The importance of the phenomenon in its influence on the configuration of oil and water with respect to oil production behavior was noted earlier by Engelberts and Klinkenberg who coined the term "viscous fingering". Theory Necessary and Sufficient Conditions for Instability and Initial Kinematics There are several levels of increasing complexity in the theoretical description of instability of fluid displacements in permeable media. Of these, the simplest description, adapted to low permeability systems, is selected for presentation. More inclusive descriptions are reserved for separate publication.

AB  - ABSTRACT: The wellbore instability problems can rise significantly if the downhole pressure is fluctuated during the tripping operation due to surge and swab effects. Even though the borehole pressure was estimated accurately by geomechanical model, the inappropriate tripping variables could reduce the proposed pressure to hold back mechanically the wellbore wall. Therefore, it is essential to include a safety factor or trip margin to account for the surge and swab pressure in the well construction stage. In this work, Numerous of wellbore instabilities in term of pipe sticking were investigated in a field in southern Iraq that revealed the drilling events experienced while pulling the string out of the hole. Thus, the swabbing effect on the bottom hole pressure was considered depend on the drilling observations and empirical equations. Swapping parameters from twenty-two wells in southern Iraq were implemented to investigate the influence of drilling practices, tools, and rheological properties on the borehole pressure variation. The combination of the drilling fluid density, yield point, plastic viscosity, BHA size, slip to slip time, tripping speed and the depth of investigations was used as input data. The mathematical formulas that account for most sensitive tripping factors were utilized in this research to consider the swabbing effects during the tripping. Afterward, commercial software was used to construct a statically derived swabbing model based on tripping data from offset wells to predict the drilling fluid reduction for particular tripping variables. The software was fed with Mud weight MWT, Flow rate FL, Weight on bit WOB, Total flow Area TFA and Revolution Per Minute RPM to get the drilling density reduction by swabbing effect based on standard linear least square method. Then, suggested tripping variables and the geomechanical model densities were plugs in the swabbing empirical model to mitigate this effect. The swapping data showed the drilling fluid density by swabbing was propositionally increased with the static fluid density and slip to slip time (TT), but the swabbing density is negatively affected by the plastic viscosity, flow rate, and the drill collar outside diameters. However, The yield point does not change the swabbing effect much. The recommended tripping variables were proposed to ensure best drilling practice and problems mitigation for the proposed mud density in the upcoming well. Therefore, tripping margin was also suggested to prevent the wellbore collapse while tripping operation in southern Iraq fields.1. INTRODUCTIONThe downhole pressure is fluctuated during the tripping operation due to surge and swab effects. These phenomena can result in different wellbore instability issues such as drilling fluid losses or pipe sticking (Mitchell, 1988). Physically, the surge pressure can be defined as the increment in bottom hole pressure due to the drill tools (casing, drill pipe) being lowered into the well. The drilling fluid is displaced out of the hole during tripping in the hole operation leading to increase in fluid annular velocity and consequently the friction pressure loss. Contrarily, the swab pressure is described as the reduction in the bottom hole pressure because the drilling tools are pulled out of the hole (Bourgoyne, 1986). As the drilling tool tripping out of the hole, the drilling fluid flows inside the hole to replace the occupied volume by steel being pulled leading to reduction in the fluid annular velocity subsequently the friction pressure loss. These increment and reduction are related to friction pressure losses alterations by pipe movement. Therefore, it is essential to include a safety factor or trip margin to account for the surge and swab pressure in the well construction stage. Different factors contribute in tripping related pressure alterations, such as tripping velocities, drilling fluid properties, drill string eccentricities, wellbore geometry variations, and types of flow regimes (Mitchell, 1988; Srivastav et al., 2012). The high tripping speed induces an increase in surge and swab pressure while low tripping speed leads to no-productive time escalation. The viscosity and destiny of drilling fluid have a significant impact on the severity of the surge and swab pressure. The lower the clearance between the hole and drilling tool the higher the surge and swab pressures. The drill string and the types of the flow regimes are out of paper scope. Numerous mathematical model has been innovated base on different disciplines to consider the drilling fluid density alterations by the tripping operation. In this work, the drilling fluid reduction by swabbing effect have considered mitigating the mechanical wellbore instability in a field in southern Iraq. Figure 1 shows drilling time breakdown for several wells in southern Iraq, and it can be observed the tripping operation worth 30% of the total drilling time. Therefore, the tripping operation should be optimized to minimize the tripping-related wellbore failure as well as the tripping non-productive time in the shale interval specifically in the production section.

AB  - Abstract: An original testing protocol was designed to study the substitution of in situ fluids in reservoir rocks with minimal impact on the in situ effective stress. The weakening effect of the substituting fluid can therefore be easily identified. Our results for the weakly-consolidated Sherwood sandstone show that (i) the strength and static elastic moduli decrease when water saturates the pore space; (ii) the injection of water in a critically loaded sample initially saturated either with air or inert oil induces a drastic increase in the creep rate and the development of a mechanical instability; (iii) the mechanical instability detected by ultrasonic and micro- seismic monitoring is mainly localized in the water-flooded zone; (iv) this instability corresponds to a loss of cohesion; (v) during oil substitution by water, the instability is delayed and the loss of cohesion is less pronounced. This loss of cohesion is expected to lead to sand production in weakly consolidated siliciclastic reservoirs. In addition, the injected fluids significantly affect the ultrasonic P-wave velocity which (vi) increases during oil injection and (vii) decreases during water injection. Therefore ultrasonic monitoring can be used to detect the advancement of the fluid front within the rock pore space. Introduction To assess water-weakening effects in reservoir rocks, previous experimental studies have focused on changes in the failure envelopes derived from mechanical tests conducted on rocks fully saturated either with water or with inert fluids. So far, little attention has been paid to the mechanical behavior of reservoir rocks during fluid substitution under conditions similar to enhanced oil recovery operations. Water-based fluids are often used during development and production operations of oil and gas fields. These operations include: (i) well drilling with water-based muds; (ii) reservoir secondary oil recovery by water flooding; (iii) chemical or thermal enhanced oil recovery; or (iv) hydraulic fracturing. Mechanisms generally associated with fluid/rock interactions include: (i) hydro-mechanics: pressure drawdown/effective stress increase; (ii) petrophysics: change in surface tension/wettability and capillary forces; (iii) hydro-dynamics: seepage forces resulting from water pressure gradients. These mechanisms have been, and still are, extensively studied and assessed for problematic fields around the world. However, hydrochemical weakening of the rock frame specifically associated with exposure to water-based fluids has also been recognized as an important driving mechanism.

AB  - Abstract Underbalanced drilling (UBD) has been used in the oil industry to avoid formation damage, reduce lost circulation and increase the rate of penetration. Underbalanced drilling in incompetent rocks, however, poses severe borehole stability problems. Numerous models have been developed to predict the time dependent wellbore collapse during drilling, in particular underbalanced drilling. Experience shows that these models require data that are hard to obtain and without these data results become unreliable. A three dimensional wellbore model has been developed at university of New South Wales to help drilling engineers determine the optimal mud composition and a range of bottom hole pressure for underbalanced drilling. The concept of thermodynamics of irreversible processes, consolidation and elastoplastic constitutive law are employed to predict the temperature and ion distribution, pore pressure and effective stresses around a borehole. These data sets can be used as input to borehole stability analysis. From the results of this study it was revealed that the effect of plasticity on stress relaxation around the wellbore is a major concern during underbalanced drilling. This relaxation especially in hoop stresses can lead the wellbore to collapse. The results also showed that the size of plastic zone depends not only on the horizontal in-situ stresses but also on the vertical in-situ stress.

AB  - ABSTRACTThe large scale vortices in the wake of a rigid cylinder undergoing forced oscillations at a constant amplitude are investigated throughout the synchronisation range by using a schlieren method. A precise description is given of the different regimes observed in the frequency range. The vortex shedding is locked to the cylinder oscillation so that the ratio between the two pulsations remains rational and keeps a constant value over the synchronisation range. The phase angle of the vortex shedding versus reduced velocity has been determined for every regime.It exhibits strong variations when the cylinder to vortex shedding frequencies ratio varies from 0.5 to 1. INTRODUCTIONThe hydrodynamic forces applied to a cable normal to a flow result from a fluid-structure coupling between the wake, which generates an oscillating crosswise force, and the cable, which oscillates due to this force. The phenomenon becomes critical when the wake frequency is near a cable vibration mode, causing an increase in the vibration amplitude and sudden changes of phase between the cable movement and the unsteady crosswise force. When the wake frequency locks onto the cable oscillation frequency, there is a large increase in drag. Reviews of the research conducted in last years on the problem of synchronization of an oscillating obstacle with its wake were published by Parkinson (1974), Sarpkaya (1979), Bearman(1984) and Griffin and Hall (1991). These works showed that large phase variations between the unsteady lift Fy and the cylinder position Y appear when a cylinder is subjected to forced oscillation near synchronization. These changes of phase mean that the instant of the oscillation cycle for which the vortex shedding generates maximum lift varies enormously with the reduced speed. Contrary to the above properties, relatively well described. concerning the cylinder movement and applied forces, the near wake structure is still poorly known.

AB  - Abstract Vapex (vapor extraction) is a promising technique for the recovery of heavy oil and bitumen reservoirs, especially for cases where steam-assisted gravity drainage and other thermal recovery methods are not economical. In the Vapex process, a solvent is injected into the reservoir to reduce the oil viscosity and mobilize it towards the production well. CO2-based Vapex is an attractive option from both economical and environmental perspectives. In CO2-based Vapex, unlike other hydrocarbon solvents, the dissolution of CO2 in oil can result in a density increase of the diluted oil. As a consequence, the diluted oil has a higher density than the immobile oil beneath and a gravitationally unstable diffusive boundary layer is induced, which may lead to natural convection. In this paper, a mathematical model for the diffusive boundary layer in the CO2-oil contact region is developed; and, the possibility of convective mixing is examined using linear stability analysis, based on the amplification of the initial perturbations. It is found that in most experimental cases, depending on the Rayleigh number of the porous medium, convective mixing occurs, which results in higher dissolution of CO2 in oil and thus a higher oil production rate than what is expected from theoretical analysis. This would explain the unexpected higher oil production rate of some experiments in Vapex when CO2 was used as a solvent. In field-scale operations, the results are different. In field cases, since it is almost impossible for the Rayleigh number to exceed the critical Rayleigh number (Rac), convection does not happen. IntroductionThe world's total reserve of heavy oil and bitumen is about six trillion barrels, which is about six times the amount of the conventional resources [1]. A major part of these resources is in Canada, Venezuela and the United States. Most of these reserves are at such depths that open-pit mining cannot be used economically, and in-situ methods have to be used to reduce the viscosity of the oil in-place and mobilize it. Either thermal methods or non-thermal methods can be used to recover these reserves. The viscosity of oil is a strong function of temperature and decreases sharply with increasing temperature. Currently steam-assisted gravity drainage (SAGD), a thermal method, is a popular method for the recovery of heavy oil and bitumen and has been successfully applied in several fields. Despite the success of this process for some reservoirs, there are many reservoirs that SAGD cannot be applied due to excess heat loss, which makes it uneconomical to operate. In thin reservoirs, the need for steam increases and the steam-to-oil ratio (SOR) is prohibitively high. Many oil and bitumen reservoirs have a bottom aquifer, and heat loss to the water can make the process infeasible [2]. There are also reservoir conditions where SAGD may not be applied, such as when water saturation is high, or porosity is low. In cases where SAGD cannot be applied, Vapex is the most promising technique for the recovery of these resources.

AB  - AbstractMost enhanced recovery schemes involve the displacement of one fluid by another. In the design of such schemes, it is important to know whether the displacement is stable or unstable. Thus, it is of interest to be able to predict the boundary which separates stable displacements from those which are unstable.Recently, a new theory was developed to predict the onset of unstable behavior. However, when this theory was compared with Hele-Shaw experiments, it was found that the non-linear time function used in the development of the theory was inappropriate. It is the purpose of this paper to show how the earlier theory can be modified so as to include a linear time function. Moreover, the modified theory is validated by comparing theoretical results with those obtained experimentally. In particular, the results obtained from carrying out a series of runs using rectangular shaped core holders packed with unconsolidated sand demonstrate that the modified theory correctly predicts the stability boundary. In addition, it is possible to use the theory to predict not only the breakthrough recovery for stable displacements, but also that for pseudostable displacements. IntroductionTwo of the more important factors determining the efficiency of any immiscible displacement process are the heterogeneity of the reservoir and the stability of the displacement process. While nature dictates the scale of the heterogeneities and the manner in which they are distributed throughout the reservoir, man has some control over the parameters which dictate whether a displacement is stable or unstable. Thus, it is of interest to study the conditions under which a displacement becomes unstable.Early stability studies of immiscible displacement demonstrated that mobility ratio, displacement velocity, system geometry and dimensions, capillary and gravitational forces system permeability and wettability were all parameters pertinent to the stability problem(1-9). However, none of these studies sought to combine these variables into one dimensionless group which could be used to quantify the stability classification. The first authors to derive such a dimensionless group, together with its critical value, were Peters and Flock(10). These authors also demonstrated that the system dimensions were the most critical parameters, because they appeared in the dimensionless group raised to the second power, whereas all the other parameters were raised to the first power.Because the analysis of Peters and Flock was based on the concept of a velocity potential, they were unable to determine completely how variations in rock and fluid properties might affect the stability boundary. By basing his analysis on the concept of a force potential rather than that of a velocity potential, Bentsen(11) was able to take proper account of the effect of rock and fluid properties on the stability problem, As a consequence, his instability number was proportional to that derived by Peters and Flock. However, a recent experimental study has demonstrated that the non-linear time function used by Bentsen in his analysis was inappropriate(12). That is, the experiments described in Reference 12 demonstrated that the distance travelled by the tip of a finger, with respect to the moving boundary, was a linear rather than a non-linear function of time.

AB  - Abstract An integrated approach to drilling fluid design and optimisation, in terms of mud weight and chemistry, for efficient shale instability management has been developed in a collaborative project. The key drilling fluid-shale interaction mechanisms included in the state-of-the-art design criteria are mud pressure penetration, chemical potential and swelling hydrational stress. Fundamental concepts, processes, models and a range of novel test equipment and procedures for laboratory simulation of the mechanisms were developed. Shale and drilling fluid properties required for the models were determined using a range of analytical and laboratory techniques. The laboratory simulation results for various mud types were used in the refinement and verification of the models. The verified models, which have been integrated in a wellbore stability analysis software, were used to conduct analyses to demonstrate the effects of shale and drilling fluid properties on time-dependent wellbore (in)stability. They highlight the conditions in which the mechanisms are critical and need to be incorporated in the analysis. In addition, the test equipment also provide effective methods of screening drilling fluids (type and formulation) for their capacity to provide the required effective mud support with time for a given shale. The understanding of the mechanisms of drilling fluid- shale interaction and the development of the capacity to model them enabled the development of drilling fluid design charts. These charts, together with a shale property database and property correlations, provide a pragmatic and effective approach for designing optimal drilling fluids to manage shale instability efficiently. The wellbore stability analysis software and drilling fluid design charts have been used in both drilling fluid program recommendation and back-analysis of field experience. A full-scale field trial of the technology is currently being undertaken in collaboration with an operating company. P. 441

AB  - AbstractIn situ pore pressure is one of the fundamental parameters required for assessing the strength and stability of geomaterials. In particular, identification of pore pressure regimes is necessary in geohazards studies. Offshore geological processes such as rapid sedimentation, minor slides, erosion, and fluid or gas seeps can result in non-hydrostatic pore pressures in critical layers, leading to strength reductions and increased risk for instability. This paper presents new technologies for the in situ measurement and long term monitoring of pore pressure and gas seepages in seabed sediments. The piezometers presented are single point borehole piezometer, the multilevel borehole piezometer, and a new CPT lance piezometer. The piezometers are designed for autonomous subsea deployment in long-term monitoring campaigns. Pore pressures can be measured to depths up to 200m below mudline (bml) in drilled geotechnical boreholes, or up to 40m bml using hydraulic standpipes based on CPT rods installed using a seabed CPT frame. A novel solution using production well technology to construct a geotechnical observation well is also presented. Two applications for gas leakage detection are presented; the first using commercially available sensors for monitoring methane in the drill shafts of a gravity based platform, and the deployment of passive gas traps to attempt to identify periodic leakage from seabed pockmark features. The equipment and techniques presented have been developed in conjunction with various geohazard assessment studies for developed and undeveloped offshore locations. Details of the technology are described, including basic technical specifications, installation approaches, and experience from actual installations. The application of some of this instrumentation in a scientific study of a North Sea pockmark seepage study are also presented and discussed. Introduction to geohazards monitoringOne of the fundamental concepts in geotechnical engineering is the effective stress principle: ?' = ?-u The total stress component (s) can be calculated based on the mass of the soil and estimated (or measured) values of the lateral stress coefficients. Pore pressure (u) is the interstitial pressure between the individual grains in a soil matrix. Pore pressure may be due to fluid or gas and in an unsaturated soil a combination of both. In this article we make no specific distinctions between pore gas pressure or pore fluid pressure, both are collectively referred to as pore pressure.Estimates of pore pressure may be made in some cases, for example using basin sedimentation models or hydrogeological models, but generally it is difficult to make a reliable estimate of pore pressure. Often pore pressure will be assumed to be hydrostatic, or with a moderate overpressure (say 5-10% over hydrostatic). Direct measurement of pore pressure is the best approach to obtain reliable pore pressures, and thus establish the effective stress state in the soil in addition to the total stress state.Virtually all geotechnical calculations regarding strength and deformation require consideration of the stress state of the oil. In classical slope stability calculations it is possible to adopt either a total stress or effective stress approach, however it is usually necessary to consider both.

AB  - Abstract Aerated liquid drilling (ALD) is defined as drilling operations using aerated liquid as drilling fluids. The ALD technology has been used to produce oil and gas from low-pressure reservoirs for over a decade. The advantages of aerated liquid drilling include minimized formation damage, reduced loss of circulation problems, increased rate of penetration, and improved drilling performance. The major problem with using aerated drilling fluids is borehole collapse which causes drilling complications. In addition to the low-level borehole pressure, fluctuation in the borehole pressure has also been recognized as one of the factors affecting borehole stability in aerated liquid drilling. This paper focuses on analyses of bottomhole pressure fluctuations due to a break in circulation and backpressure variation. The pressure fluctuation due to breaking circulation is characterized by the gradient loss (GL), defined as the equivalent circulating density (ECD) less the equivalent mud density (EMD). The pressure fluctuation due to backpressure change is evaluated using the pressure instability factor (PIF) defined as the ratio of change in the bottomhole pressure to the change in the surface choke pressure.Sensitivity analyses with an analytical model indicate that the GL decreases with depth and backpressure, and increases with both liquid pumping rate and gas injection rate. The PIF increases with depth and backpressure, and decreases with both liquid pumping rate and gas injection rate. At a given depth and backpressure, it is the combination of liquid and gas flow rates, rather than the injection GLR, that determines the PIF. Following a change in backpressure, the transition time for borehole pressure to stabilize at a new level depends on several factors including well depth, well geometry, and liquid pumping rate. This paper presents an easy-to-use method for predicting pressure fluctuations and identifying key factors affecting the pressure stability in aerated liquid drilling. The results can be applied to designing of hydraulics for underbalanced drilling (UBD) and managed pressure drilling (MPD) wells. Aerated liquids are currently used for underbalanced drilling (UBD) and managed pressure drilling (MPD) operations for reducing formation damage and lost circulation(1, 2). Fluctuation in borehole pressure has been recognized as one of the major problems in aerated liquid drilling due to its detrimental impact on borehole stability(3, 4). Severe borehole damage and failure can result from the problem of instable pressure. However, a systematic analysis of the subject problem has not been found in the literature. This paper fills the gap. A careful analysis of the pressure stability problem requires an accurate hydraulics model for multiphase flow. Although both steady state flow and transient flow simulators are available in the drilling industry for aerated liquid drilling hydraulics calculations(4- 9), the results from these simulators are frequently conflicting(10) due to different assumptions that were made in mathematical formulations. In addition, tedious procedures have to be followed to analyze the behaviour of aerated liquid with transient flow simulators.

Tan, Australian Petroleum Cooperative Research Centre, CSIRO Petroleum, Melbourne 3149, Australia.AbstractWellbore instability in shales is one of the primary problems in oil and gas well drilling. The problem of wellbore instability in shales has been traditionally tackled by using oil-based muds. However, this technique is costly and restricted by the Environmental Regulatory Bodies. Various non-oil-based mud approaches have been attempted based on experimental investigations. Nevertheless, there has not been an in-depth understanding of the mechanisms of wellbore instability in shales developed in these studies. Consequently, the outcome of these studies can not serve as a general guideline for formulating drilling fluids for drilling different types of shales. Recent studies have shown that borehole instability in shales can be managed by controlling the chemical potential of drilling muds. One of the critical aspects in the chemical potential approach is that shales are not ideal membrane, i.e. the reflection coefficient is less than 1. The value of the reflection coefficient of a shale being drilled must be known before one can manage the wellbore instability problem in the shale by means of controlling the chemical composition of the drilling mud. The reflection coefficient of a shale membrane varies with the type of shale being drilled, the composition of the formation water in the shale, the burial depth of the shale and the chemical composition of the drilling mud used. This paper describes a mechanistic tool which incorporates the above mentioned parameters to predict the reflection coefficient of shales. The model is verified by experimental data obtained with a shale from the North West Shelf of Australia (Shale W). An example is also given to show how the tool can be used to manage wellbore instability in shales by controlling the chemical composition of muds. The results of this study can be used as a guideline for formulating proper muds to drill troublesome shales.IntroductionDrilling through shale may encounter a variety of problems, such as bit balling, sloughing, creep, washout and even complete hole collapse. The cost arisen from wellbore instability in shales has been estimated conservatively to be in the order of magnitude of US$500 million per year. Wells in troublesome shales have been traditionally drilled with oil-based muds. However, this technique is under critical scrutiny due to its negative environmental impact and is banned in some regions of the world. To overcome the problem, a number of non-oil-based mud approaches have been attempted. For example, O'Brien and Chenevert, Mondshine, Clerk et al. and Corley et al. developed various polymer/KCl water-based muds to improve wellbore stability in shales. Walker et al. reported the improvement of wellbore stability in shales by using potassium modified lime muds. Chenevert developed glycerol mud to reduce shale swelling. However, all these studies are based on experimental investigation only and there is no in-depth understanding of the mechanisms of wellbore instability in shales. The objective of this paper is to provide a fundamental understanding of the mechanism by which wellbore instability in shales occurs and a guideline for field engineers to manage wellbore instability problems by controlling the chemical composition of drilling muds. A mechanistic tool is provided for predicting the chemical composition of a drilling mud needed to drill a given shale safely.TheoryFundamentalsBorehole instability problems in shaly formations are closely connected to the "bulk properties" of shales.P. 253

AB  - Recently, great efforts have been dedicated to the phenomenon of wave-induced seabed instability in the vicinity of marine structures. The evaluation of the wave-induced soil response (including pore pressure, effective stresses and soil displacements) has been recognized as an important factor in the analysis of the instability of the seabed. This paper proposes a finite difference model in a curvilinear coordinate system to investigate the wave-induced soil response in the vicinity of a buried pipeline. The potential of the wave-induced seabed instability is studied as a function of geometry (buried depth and the diameter of a pipe) as well as the degree of saturation. INTRODUCTION A marine pipeline is a commonly-used offshore installation for dispose of industrial and municipal waste water into the sea, for cooling water in nuclear power plants, and for the transportation of gas and crude oil from offshore platforms. The wave-induced soil response in the vicinity of a buried pipeline has been recognized by geotechnical engineers as one of the important factors that must be considered in the analysis of pipeline stability. Design of marine pipelines for their instability is a rather complicated problem. An inadequate design can cause flotation of the pipeline, leading subsequently to costly failure and environmental catastrophes (Clukey et at., 1989). Thus, it is beneficial for engineering practice to improve knowledge on wave-soil-pipeline interaction. When ocean waves propagate in shallow water, they exert dynamic pressures on the seafloor. The fluctuations of wave pressure will further induce effective stresses and pore pressures in a sedimentary seabed. When the pore pressure becomes excessive in comparison with changes in effective stresses, the seabed may be moved in the either vertical (liquefaction) or horizontal directions (shear failure), and then lead to an instability of the seabed (Rahman, 1997).

AB  - Abstract In one of the largest oil fields in Middle East, the typical well design is to set the conductor just 40 ft below the ground, the surface casing 100 ft inside next competent formation due to shallow total loss zone below the conductor and the intermediate casing in the first competent formation before entering the reservoirs interval. The intermediate section includes a combination of formations that have total losses zones and extremely unstable shales, especially when drilled with total losses. In most cases, encountering lost circulation results in formation collapse. The severity of the formation collapse risk in this section ranges from simple tights spots cleared with reaming up and down to stuck pipes, sidetracks and in several cases plug and abandonment of wells. To reduce the likelihood and severity of this risk, there was a need to review the casing seats to isolate unstable formations before entering the intermediate loss zones. A detailed study was carried out where diverse options were analyzed, including adding a casing string and changing casing seats of existing casing strings. The study concluded that keeping the same number of casing strings and deepening only the surface casing seat as close as possible to the intermediate loss zone, covering the entire unstable formation but not entering the intermediate loss zone, would be the most efficient solution. Experts supported this change based on the principle that dealing with an unstable formation when it is below the loss zone is easier than when the same formation is above the loss zone. The new casing seat choice has been successfully implemented at over 100 wells, with 100% success ending the borehole instability problems. Since then there has been no sidetrack or location plugged and abandoned for borehole instability in intermediate section. This paper encompasses a comprehensive analysis of the mechanism of unstable formations reaction to the loss circulation, resultant stuck pipe mechanisms, unsuccessful attempts to cure losses in this zone, improving fly mixed mud inhibition, impacts of modifications in well design on zonal isolation and finally reaching the safest, time and cost-effective solution.

AB  - AbstractA laminated and fissured formation around a horizontal borehole is modeled as a combination of intact rock blocks and permeable fractures with a DEM code. The model is used for understanding the mechanism of rock failure problems observed in a shale formation of an offshore field. Different mud weights and stress conditions are applied to the model to simulate the rock failure around deviated holes in laminated and fissured shale. The numerical simulation shows that shear failure along the bedding planes is the predominant mode of collapse of the hole when mud under pressures penetrate into bedding planes on which shear stress is applied. The severity of wellbore instability varies with stress states and wall conditions. The effect of a plugging agent in mud is verified by comparison between permeable and impermeable wellbore models.IntroductionIn recent decades, geomechanical and rock mechanics studies for drilling optimization and reservoir management have been eagerly conducted by many researchers and engineers. As a new result, fundamental understanding of failure mechanism of rocks and geomechanical environment is shared by academic and industrial societies. For the purpose of reducing drilling troubles and optimizing drilling operations, rock failure analysis for wellbore instability has become popular and common after its remarkably successful application in the Cusiana field in Colombia1. Intensive studies have been conducted to improve mechanical behavior models of various rock types, numerical simulation codes and computer aided engineering tools, and engineering procedures to apply such techniques to field operations. However, currently available techniques and numerical tools in which elastic, homogeneous, continuous, and isotropic rock models are adopted could give misleading results due to the complex nature of real formation rocks. In fissured or highly laminated formations, anisotropy and discontinuity of the rock mass have predominant effects on rock failures, as well as poroelastic effects caused by pore pressure change in the fractures and rock matrix. In this paper, a two-dimensional, fluid-solid coupled model of Discrete Element Method (DEM) simulator is applied to wellbore failure modeling of a laminated rock to analyze the effect of pore-pressure penetration through the fractures. Key factors of the stability and anticipated failure mechanism of the hole troubles observed in a real field are discussed.Field experiences of rock failure in a heavily laminated formationHole instability phenomena observed in real fields. The authors investigated the records of drilling troubles in Japanese oil fields2 and found many phenomena which can not be explained by conventional approaches and understanding of borehole failures, such as: Severe caving is observed simultaneously with lost circulation. Increasing mud density to maintain wellbore stability does not work well, and increased mud weight may ever worsen the hole condition. Break-out directions determined by a caliper log vary with depth, and suddenly change discontinuously.These experiences suggest the limitation of conventional mechanical models. Many factors complicate of the situation, such as complex constitutive laws of each type of rock, fluid motion and poroelastic effect, fluid exchange between borehole and formation by pressure and chemical potential effects, anisotropy and heterogeneity of the formation, and so on. The real situation must be a combination of such effects.Hole instability phenomena observed in real fields.The authors investigated the records of drilling troubles in Japanese oil fields2 and found many phenomena which can not be explained by conventional approaches and understanding of borehole failures, such as: Severe caving is observed simultaneously with lost circulation.

AB  - AbstractThe problem of cuttings transport in the inclined sections of ERW's is a major concern in the oilwell drilling industry. This paper presents a field on the possibility of keeping drilling in the presence of a controlled instability process. The study is supported by an innovative time dependent mathematical model, along with a computer implementation of it, which is based on the well-known two-layer model approach. An innovative feature of this model consists in the consideration of the added amount of solids that comes from the crumbling and cave-in of the wellbore. The model results, coupled with an exponential approach, enables to optimize circulation of different lengths ERWs. The paper represents a further step on the integrated analysis of cuttings transport and wellbore stability problems, aiming cost reduction and safe well design.

AB  - INTRODUCTIONAs the cause of instability of slopes, 1) Change of slope profile (toe erosion, artificial excavation, etc.) 2) Increase of pore pressure are generally known. However, according to our field investigation and measurement of a crystalline schist landslide, instability of the slope can not be explained by 1)change of slope profile or 2)increase of pore pressure, but we have found "underground erosion" must be the main cause of instability of the slope. "Underground erosion" has hardly been studied in engineering field and geological or geomorphological field up to now. However, "underground erosion" is the main cause of instability of some crystalline schist slopes and it acts a vital role in landslides triggered by vertical subsidence (Sassa et al. 1980a,b)BRIEF VIEW OF THE ZENTOKU LANDSLIDEThe authors have studied one of biggest crystalline schist landslides "the Zentoku landslide" in Japan since 1972. The landslide locates in the Shikoku island and its scale is about 1.2 km in length, 2.0 km in width, 25-30° in slope inclination and 40 -50 m in depth. The ground consists of clayey schist, sandy schist and quartz schist, and the beddings are nearly parallel to slope. The whole landslide is too big for a precise investigation, then we selected the Taniare district of the landslide as the object of our investigations. Fig.1 is the map of the Taniare district. "Crushed zone" and "underground valley" in the figure were estimated by seismic explorations Sassa et al. 1980c).The movement of the Zentoku landslide have been measured from the end of 1973 by extensometers on line X and shear displacement displacement meters (designed by K. Sassa, 1980c) on line Y and pipe strain meters in the boreholes No.1-16. The ground water levels and precipitation have been observed, too.EXAMINATION OF THE INFLUENCES OF SLOPE PROFILE AND PORE PRESSUREFig.2 is the example of extensometers in 1975, 1976,1978. In the figure the extension/ compression observed by each extensometer is accumulated from the end of the extensometer line. A right/up line shows extension and a right/down line shows compression. Since "Road" seems to have been stable according to the data of extensometers and its retaining wall has been intact, "Road" is dealt as the stable point. Therefore, the vertical distance from the horizontal line of each year to the respective point of the graph indicates the movement at the point/time. The profile of the slope and their slip planes are also shown in Fig.2. The depth of slip planes was decided by the insert-type strain meter designed by K. Sassa, 1980c) and the pipe strain meters in 13 boreholes along this line. And the sliding blocks were decided from the results of extensometers including Fig.2. The observation of extensometers for these seven years and Fig.2 made clear that some tens cm movement took place every year, though there was no change of slope profile. Slip planes finish at "Road" and there have been no toe erosion and no artificial excavation, and no filling, too.

AB  - AbstractWellbore instability can lead to expensive operational problems during the drilling, completion and production of horizontal and inclined wells. This paper reviews the direct and indirect symptoms of wellbore instability, its root causes, and various empirical and deterministic modelling approaches to predicting the risk of hole collapse or convergence. In general, linear elastic models that are only concerned with stability at the wellbore wall often give overly pessimistic predictions. An alternative approach, using the extent of the "yielded" zone around an unstable wellbore and the kinematics of rock detachment, is proposed for practical risk assessments. A case history for an open hole completed horizontal well in a limestone reservoir under high drawdown is described. General guidelines for conducting field-oriented stability assessments conclude the paper.IntroductionWellbore instability during the drilling, evaluation, completion and production phases of a well has become an increasingly important concern for many operators applying horizontal well technology. Traditional conservative completion methods for vertical wells are being challenged as operators attempt to reduce well costs and still derive the improved productivity and access to hydrocarbon reserves offered by horizontal wells. More recent horizontal well innovations include the use of underbalanced drilling techniques(l), slimhole completions, side track or re-entry wells with open hole build sections(2,3), and multiple laterals from a single vertical or horizontal wellbore(4). In applying these new technologies, there are often issues posed during the well planning stage where the risk of hole collapse in the short or long term must be addressed. In many cases, the selection of an optimal strategy to prevent or mitigate the risk of wellbore collapse might compromise one or more of the following other elements of the overall well design: the rate of penetration; the risk of differential sticking; drilled cuttings and mud disposal options; hole cleaning abilities; hole size, and consequently the completion and stimulation options available; formation damage risk; stimulation requirements; the ability to log the hole; and the selection of surface sand handling facilities (where sand production is anticipated). In many cases there may be insufficient experience with a given reservoir and the desired completion, hence the prior performance of vertical wells cannot be used, by itself, to guide the well design.This paper reviews the symptoms of wellbore instability and its fundamental causes. Published approaches to wellbore stability prediction will be described, particularly those which address the most common problems faced in developing normally to slightly under pressured oil and gas fields. Emphasis is placed on techniques and conditions applicable to Western Canada where there has been a rapid pace of horizontal well development, particularly with re-entry wells. Predictive techniques applicable to build, inclined or horizontal sections of a well, during the drilling, completion and subsequent production phases, will then be described. Selected case histories from the literature are cited and an example of a wellbore stability prediction for Shell Canada's first horizontal open hole completion is described.This paper will not review all the wellbore stability models which have been developed for vertical wells.

AB  - Abstract Drilling of shale has long been a challenge due to its strong potential for wellbore instability. Designing of drilling fluids which minimize the interaction with shale is critical in the success of these drilling practices. Shale instability is mainly related to its abundance of clay content, distribution of reactive clays such as smectite, bedding and thin laminae (fissility). In many situations, small faults and fractures may intersect laminated shale, which causes the rock to crack in various directions. Though shale has many common properties, each shale formation has specific features in clay minerals, rock structures, and deformation properties; consequently their response to drilling fluids varies. As a result, our goal is to understand the petrologic and deformation features of each specific shale formation and their potential interactions with various drilling fluids. The traditional laboratory methods such as dispersion test, bulk hardness test, and swelling test cannot fully reflect the impacts of rock structure on fracture development and rock failing. This can be compensated by immersion test which is designed to directly observe the rock-fluid interactions and fracture development. Our laboratory test results indicate that the composition and concentration of chemical additives in drilling fluids have significant impact on controlling and reducing the interaction between shale and fluids. Based on laboratory studies, we have designed custom drilling fluids for many shale formations around the world. The custom drilling fluids reduce the inherent wellbore instability found in drilling shales. Introduction In the past decade, the petroleum industry has been drilling substantially more technically challenging wells. One of the increases is the drilling of shale formation, partially due to shale gas becoming a progressively more important source of natural gas in the world. Drilling of shale has long been a challenge due to its strong potential for wellbore instability, which is mainly caused by the imbalance of in-situ stresses and/or interactions between drilling fluid and shale. The mechanical failure of shale related to stress status can be minimized or prevented by the adjustment of mud weight. Nevertheless, chemical interactions have to be minimized through the selection of proper drilling fluid with appropriate chemical additives. This paper will focus on the chemical interactions between shale and drilling fluid by investigating the petrologic and deformational features of shale when drilling fluids are introduced. We will then present laboratory test results that are indicative of the composition and concentration of chemical additives in drilling fluids having significant impact on controlling and reducing the interaction between shale and fluids. Petrologic Features of Shale and the Potential Instability Mechanisms in Drilling Fluid Shale is a fine-grained, siliciclastic sedimentary rock. Although shale has many common properties, each shale formation has specific features in clay minerals, rock structures, and deformation properties. These differences make each shale formation exhibit different responses to drilling fluids. In order to gain a better perspective of the potential interactions of the target shale formation with drilling fluids, it is essential to understand the petrologic and deformation features of each specific shale formation. The understanding of the potential physical and chemical interactions between shale and drilling fluid will help design the drilling fluid that will ultimately minimize or prevent the wellbore instability.

AB  - ABSTRACTThe mechanism of the damage to gravity type quay walls caused by the liquefaction of backfill ground during earthquake is investigated, regarding the vibration properties of caisson and backfill ground, and their interaction. A series of model shaking table tests was conducted on four types of caissons with different mass and aspect ratios of section, and those caissons were shook with the backfill grounds with different relative densities in order to clarify the behavior of the caisson type quay walls in the course of liquefaction during earthquake. Also the vibration properties of prototype quay wall was examined through the power spectrum analysis of measured microtremors. Finally numerical simulation with mass-spring-dashpot model was employed to explain the instability of the gravity type quay wall during earthquake. INTRODUCTIONSignificant damages to port and harbor facilities have been caused often by the liquefaction of reclaimed lands during large earthquakes. The functions of quay walls were frequently lost severely when the gravity type quay wall caissons were displaced toward sea and/or subsided, and also foundations of structures and underground structures were damaged due to the flow deformation of the ground which was triggered by the displacement of the quay walls (e.g., Inagaki et al., 1996; Kamon et al., 1996). Close examination on the damages to port and harbor facilities caused by recent large earthquakes clarified that the damages are strongly dependent on the occurrence of the liquefaction, and that the remedial treatment of the backfill against liquefaction is effective to protect the quay walls (Japanese Geotechnical Society, 1994, 1998 and 1999; Hokkaido Development Bureau, 1996). The authors have been investigated the mechanism of the damage to gravity type quay wall during earthquake (Miura et al., 1997; Kohama et al., 1998). Some series of shaking table tests were carried out on the model quay walls.

AB  - The Effect of Instability on Relative Permeability Curves Obtained by Permeability Curves Obtained by the Dynamic-Displacement Method Summary. A study was undertaken to investigate how instability would affect the oil/water relative permeability curves obtained by the dy-namic-displacement method. In this method, stable Buckley-Leveret displacement theory is used to calculate relative permeability curves from coreflood data. Thus, to obtain the true relative permeability curves by the dynamic-displacement method, the coreflood must be stable. However, the method frequently has been applied to unstable corefloods. The consequence of this application of the method has not been previously reported. We compared oil/water relative permeability curves from steady-state and dynamic-displacement experiments at several levels of instability. The results showed that the dynamic-displacement relative permeability curves deviated significantly from the steady-state curves as the degree of instability increased. This observation indicates the need to scale laboratory relative permeability measurements to account for instability. To obtain representative relative permeability curves for numerical modeling of a reservoir, laboratory displacement experiments should be conducted at the same degree of instability as that in the reservoir. Introduction Routine laboratory measurements of oil/water relative permeabilities use the dynamic-displacement method, also referred to as the permeabilities use the dynamic-displacement method, also referred to as the unsteady-state method. In this method, the core is first saturated with oil, which is then displaced with water. Oil and water relative permeabilities are then computed from production and pressure data. permeabilities are then computed from production and pressure data. The technique for computing oil/water relative permeabilities from dynamic-displacement experiments was developed by Welge and Johnson et al. Their derivation of the technique was based on the assumption of a stable Buckley-Leverett displacement. This type of displacement is characterized by the advancement of water as a diffuse front. However, a stable displacement is not always encountered in a dynamic-displacement experiment. It is often necessary to use high-viscosity oils and high displacement rates to obtain a wide saturation range and to eliminate gravity segregation and boundary effects. High displacement rates and high oil/water viscosity ratios, however, tend to make the displacement of oil by water unstable. An unstable displacement is characterized by the lack of a diffuse front of the displacing phase. Instead, the displacing phase advances through the core in the form of well-defined channels known as viscous fingers. Thus instability leads to a breakdown of the assumption of stable Buckley-Leverett displacement. Because this assumption is the principal basis of Welge's and Johnson et al.'s technique for calculating relative permeabilities, it would be of interest to investigate the effect of instability on the computed relative permeabilities. The objective of this study was to conduct an experimental investigation of the effect of instability on oil/water relative permeabilities, as measured by the dynamic-displacement (unsteady-state) permeabilities, as measured by the dynamic-displacement (unsteady-state) technique. This was accomplished by performing waterflood experiments on unconsolidated sand packs saturated with viscous oils. Different levels of instability, as represented by the Peters-Flock stability number, were achieved by varying displacement rate, sand wettability, and oil viscosity. Oil and water relative permeabilities in each case were computed by Welge's and Johnson et al. permeabilities in each case were computed by Welge's and Johnson et al. technique. A set of control relative permeability data was obtained by the steady-state method for comparison with those obtained from dynamic-displacement data. This paper presents our results, which show that the relative permeability data obtained by the dynamic-displacement method are significantly influenced by the degree of instability of the displacement. Literature Review The effect of instability on dynamic-displacement relative permeability measurements has received only limited treatment in the permeability measurements has received only limited treatment in the literature. Displacement rate, viscosity ratio, interfacial tension (IFT), and rock wettability have been recognized as factors influencing displacement stability. Peters and Flocks developed a dimensionless stability number for quantitative prediction of the onset of in-stability in a displacement process. Their stability number for a cylindrical system is given by (M-1)(v - vc) wd2 Ns = ------------------------------,........................(1) NwKwor sigma where kwor (Pw -Po) g cos sigma vc = ------------------------------,........................(2) w(M-1) and k wor o M = -----------------...................................... (3) k oiw w The critical value of the stability number was determined to be 13.56. This number and its critical value provide a necessary and sufficient condition for predicting the onset of instability in both oil-wet and water-wet porous media. If in a given cylindrical system the computed value of the stability number exceeds the critical value of 13.56, then the displacement will be unstable. In addition, the magnitude of the stability number provides quantitative information regarding the severity of instability. The higher the stability number, the more severe is the degree of instability. If the stability number for a displacement is less than the critical value, then the displacement will be stable. A detailed discussion on calculating the stability number is presented in the Appendix. Sufi et al. reported the effects of displacement rate on oil and water relative permeability curves obtained by the dynamic-displacement method. The oil relative permeabilities increased only slightly with increasing rate, while the water relative permeabilities exhibited marked increases. permeabilities exhibited marked increases.

AB  - ABSTRACT:Three possible mechanisms of borehole failure associated with different scales are considered: (1) slip on a fault in a vicinity of the opening (large scale); (2) multiple sliding distributed over oriented systems of parallel joints, cracks, or rock foliation (intermediate scale); and (3) propagation of pre-existing randomly oriented micro-cracks that result in spalling or borehole breakout (small scale). For each of the failure types 2-D models of the mechanisms of borehole instability have been developed. In the case of a near-by fault, the extent of its slip essentially depends on the fault orientation. In laminated rock, where strength anisotropy exist, inelastic zones in the anisotropic material are qualitatively different from those appearing in isotropic rock where there is clear asymmetry. Finally when the previous two mechanisms cannot be invoked, extensive unstable growth of pre-existing micro-cracks in compression that parallel the borehole surface takes place followed by buckling of the thin rock plates between the growing cracks as the mechanism of borehole breakouts.1. INTRODUCTIONWhen drilling circular openings (tunnels or boreholes) in rock, different types of instabilities can occur near the borehole wall due to in situ stress concentration (Figure 1). Elongation of the instabilities are, in most cases, aligned perpendicular to the minimum principal stress. The petroleum industry experiences financial losses because of borehole breakouts caused by a particular type of instability. Furthermore, similar phenomena in mining and tunneling lead not only to financial problems but also to human casualties. Although the orientation of breakouts can, in some cases, indicate the principal directions of the in situ stress tensor (e.g., Mastin, 1988), any attempt to correlate area or volume of broken rock to stress magnitude will require an understanding of the failure mechanism (s) responsible for the final borehole geometry (Detournay andRoegiers, 1986). Conventionally, borehole instabilities have been related to shear failure dictated either by the stress conditions (e.g., Zoback et al., 1985; Cheatham, 1993; Haimson and Song, 1993; Ong and Roegiers, 1993) or by stresses acting on pre-existing plains of low or no cohesion. The problem, however, is to reconcile the assumption of shear failure with the shapes of spalled rock pieces observed in the opening walls (Figure 1). That is, spalling suggests tensile failure, a brittle mechanism (e.g., Santarelli and Brown, 1989; Ewy and Cook, 1990; Brady and Zoback, 1993; Lee and Haimson, 1993). Additionally, the failure mechanisms depend on the initial rock structure which, accordingly, should be taken into account. This paper attempts considers and compares different mechanisms of borehole instabilities associated with natural fracture systems of different scales similar to the multiscale approach used by others (e.g., Dyskin et al., 1992). The first, obvious type of instability results in slipping on a previously stable fault situated in a vicinity of the opening (large scale). This sliding can occur due to the opening- induced disturbance in the original stress field while a fault can be generally recognized as the weakest discontinuity having a better potential for failure in comparison to smaller defects (cracks).

AB  - Abstract Both oil- and water-based fluids have been used to drill in the Fayetteville shale play with mixed results. Oil-based muds (OBM) provide reliable inhibition and drilling performance, but environmental and economic concerns have generated interest in water-based alternatives. However, drilling with traditional water-based muds (WBM) such as lignite/lignosulfonate, gel/polymer, potassium chloride (KCl)/polymer, polyanionic cellulose (PAC)/starch, and partially hydrolyzed polyacrylamide/polyacrylate (PHPA) brought only marginal success. Conventional silicate WBM is known for preventing both clay hydration and dispersion, but requires high concentrations of potassium silicate and high dilution rates. It can also exhibit poor lubricity and temperature stability. Developing the optimal WBM for Fayetteville applications requires a clear understanding of how that shale is destabilized. Insufficient physico/chemical inhibition can lead to unwanted water absorption, which can cause stress fracturing and delamination. These conditions provided the right opportunity to test and optimize the sealing and inhibitive properties of a new potassium silicate-treated fluid containing much lower concentrations of potassium silicate. The unique inhibition mechanism is the surface adsorption and chemical reaction of the silicate salt with the formation surface, which provides a thin pressure and chemical barrier on the wellbore face. Extensive lab and field data demonstrate that the new WBM helps prevent hole washout, tripping difficulties, low gravity solids build-up and the excessive torque and drag typically encountered in Fayetteville drilling operations. The new system is now a widely used alternative to OBM, with a 70+ well track record at the time of this writing. This paper describes the technical process used to design, formulate, and apply the customized potassium silicate-treated WBM for use in the stressed Fayetteville shale play. Mineralogical analysis, microscopy studies and continuous improvement based on field observations are discussed in detail. Introduction In most shale plays, the drilling fluid is deemed successful if the well can be drilled to the planned depth with a stable wellbore. However, a wide variety of downhole conditions can be found among the individual shale plays, and achieving long-term wellbore stability depends on matching the fluid to the requirements of the reservoir shale. Mineralogy, hole angle, and bottomhole temperature represent a few differentiating factors in unconventional gas reservoirs. While oil-based mud (OBM) is widely used for its drilling efficiencies, it comes with the liabilities and costs associated with cuttings disposal. Lost circulation is also typically more costly with an OBM than a water-based mud (WBM), and some of the naturally fractured shale plays are prone to lost returns. Therefore, operators have exhibited interest in using a WBM that can deliver drilling performance on par with OBM. This includes minimizing torque and drag, providing equivalent lubricity and avoiding excessive low gravity solids content that can result from destabilizing the shale. A customized approach is required to formulate a WBM that delivers optimal performance in a specific shale play, such as the Fayetteville shale. This fluid design method relies on information and samples taken from a wide range of locations. Detailed investigation of the well parameters includes mineralogy analysis, expected bottomhole temperature, economic expectations, environmental factors and other reservoir-specific considerations.

AB  - Rachford Jr., H.H., Member AIME, Humble Oil and Refining Co., Houston, Tex. Abstract This work presents a first-order analysis of the instability underlying viscous fingering in adverse viscosity-ratio water floods. It extends previous analyses of frontal instabilities, which were carried out with equations for parallel plate models, by including effects of the saturation transition zone observed behind the front in water floods in water wet systems. This zone tends to insulate incipient fingers from the high-mobility water; thus conditions for the onset of fingering differ from those in the parallel plate theory. Finite-difference solutions of the two-dimensional equations of displacement in porous media exhibited the predicted stability characteristics in six hypothetical field- and laboratory-scale floods in rectangular reservoirs. In contrast to results with parallel plate systems, this paper concludes that for water-wet reservoirs, laboratory models scaled by the usual criteria are also correctly scaled for frontal instability. Further, fingering in the systems studied can occur in any saturation range behind the front, and may occur at an intermediate saturation even though stability obtains both at the saturation corresponding to the Buckley-Leverett front and near residual oil saturation. Other points of contrast are that the likelihood of occurrence of fingering may not increase as flow rate or viscosity difference increases, but may be sensitive to changes in the relative permeability and capillary pressure functions. Introduction The recovery of oil by water flooding frequently involves displacing the oil by water of a lower viscosity. Displacement of a fluid by a less viscous one may lead to gross channeling or fingering like that observed in solvent floods, in which it severely lowers recovery efficiency. In addition to adverse effects on recovery, it has been suggested that the unstable movement causing fingering may interfere with interpretation of scaled model studies of proposed water floods, since the instability in the model might not be faithfully scaled to that in the reservoir prototype. In view of the serious implications of this possible breakdown of widely used scaled model techniques, it is the purpose of this paper to examine the question further. Instabilities in the solutions of systems of differential equations imply a loss of smooth dependence on initial and boundary conditions. Thus, the possibility exists that in using models whose scaling is based on the differential system there may arise size- and rate-dependent factors which are not properly scaled. This possibility was examined in detail by Chouke et al., who analyzed the instability of frontal advance in a related problem, water-oil displacement in parallel plate models, in which a moving interface separates two regions of constant, unequal mobilities. First-order perturbation theory predicts the existence of a critical wave length for the growth of perturbations: and a wave length of maximum instability of . The interpretation is that wave lengths in a perturbation which are longer than will grow. Thus, if the width of a two-dimensional channel is greater than , fingers will grow, and the spacing of the fingers which grow at the maximum rate will be approximately . It is important that the higher the velocity and/or the difference in flow resistance, the lower is , and thus the greater the number of fingers that can grow in a given model. In applying these conclusions to porous media, a pseudo-interfacial tension, , was assumed for the invasion front. Since this would not necessarily be equal to the liquid-liquid interfacial tension, an unknown constant was substituted for in the foregoing expression for . JPT P. 133^

AB  - Summary Anticipating when and where asphaltenes may flocculate during oil production is a key step in successfully preventing or mitigating asphaltene problems in the field. Because there will be no deposition without precipitation, mapping of asphaltene stability over a wide range of temperature, pressure, and composition is required. The asphaltene-instability-trend (ASIST) allows the determination of the onset of asphaltene instability to be established with a series of liquid n-alkanes. These data are used to predict asphaltene stability of live fluids by extrapolating the onset condition from the base data to reservoir conditions by use of a linear extrapolation of the onset solubility parameter vs. square root of the partial molar volume of the precipitant. This extrapolation has been demonstrated previously to be accurate for methane and a model oil. The present work verifies that such an extrapolation is valid for predicting the asphaltene instability for mixtures of methane, ethane, and propane with a representative stock-tank oil (STO). The STO was combined with known amounts of methane, ethane, or propane. The asphaltene onset pressure was determined by a combination of near-infrared (NIR) light scattering and microscopic observation. The onset conditions at ambient pressures were examined for flocculation periods ranging from 20 minutes to 24 hours. Onset pressures calculated with the 5-hour ASIST trends compared well with measured onset pressures. Introduction Asphaltenes are materials in a crude oil that are among the highest molecular weight and/or those with the highest degree of polarity (Long 1981) and aromaticity (Cimino et al. 1995). These large molecules have limited solubility in saturated hydrocarbons, tend to form aggregates that are dispersed in crude oils, and form separate heavy phases in response to changes in pressure, temperature, or composition of the oil mixture. The amount of material that separates (asphaltene amount) and the solubility conditions at which separation occurs (asphaltene-flocculation onset) vary not only with the composition of the asphaltenes themselves, but also with the size of the paraffinic precipitants, whether these are the native crude-oil light ends or added nonsolvents (typically, n-pentane or n-heptane). Wang (2000) demonstrated that asphaltene onset conditions--defined in terms of the mixture refractive index (RI), which for nonpolar species can be related to the mixture solubility parameter (d) (Buckley et al. 1998)--changed predictably with molar volume of n-alkane precipitating agents. Extrapolation of the relationship established by measurements with liquid n-alkanes to predict asphaltene instability during depressurization was proposed (Wang and Buckley 2001a). Numerous successful applications of ASIST (Buckley et al. 2007) have since been published (e.g., Wang et al. 2004) suggesting that extrapolation of the ASIST relationship is reasonable. Nevertheless, direct verification is needed of the link between asphaltene instability, upon addition of normal alkanes, and the asphaltenes that appear during depressurization of a crude oil.

AB  - Abstract Overcoming wellbore drilling instability in fractured-rock formations always presents one of the major challenges to drilling engineers. Due to different fluid-diffusion rates and compressibility degrees between the rock's matrix and fracture network, there are two distinct pore-pressure fields and subsequently different effective stresses developed in a saturated fractured formation. It is recognized that wellbore instabilities such as collapses are caused by excessive effective stress concentrations at or near the borehole wall, and mud losses are due to fracturing the rock formation. Because both the mud/rock fluidpressure differential and fractures' deformation modify the effective stresses in the wellbore wall, such intricate responses require a wellbore solution that accounts for the fracture network, intact rock matrix mechanics, and the balance of drilling mud density. In this work, the effects on real-time collapse and fracture gradients that dictate the safe mud weight window are evaluated analytically, incorporating the effects of natural fracture network via a simulated field case. Analyses reveal that neglecting the naturally fractured nature of the formation falls short in simulating the wellbore instability since it predicted a narrower mud weight window for the drilling operation. Introduction In oil-and-gas operations, the majority of drilling footage is carried out through low-permeability rock formations such as shale, chalk, granite, etc. Many of these subsurface intervals are in-situ fractured and may be treated as such when it comes to drilling operations and wellbore-stability planning. The ultralow-permeability rock matrix is highly fractured not only at the macroscale, e.g., bedding planes as observed in many wellbore formation microscanner images (FMI) but also at the microscale, e.g., natural fractures as seen on thin sections and scanning electron microscopy (SEM) images (Han et al. 2009). As a result, classical wellbore-stability analyses and mudweight-window calculations are not adequate, in many instances, to estimate the mud density to prevent wellbore collapse or to avoid wellbore fracturing which may appear as borehole enlargement/erosion, tight hole, and mud losses. In compact rock formations bearing low to ultralow permeability/diffusivity, there are significant transient pore pressure changes due to Darcy flow between the wellbore and the formation. As such, it is evident that time-delayed failures are typical in these formations as widely reported in the field (Yamamoto et al. 2002) and require a time-dependent poroelastic analysis (Cui et al. 1997). When the rock is also fractured, it is mechanically weakened and exhibits high-permeability fluid-flow paths within the low-permeability intact shale matrix. Because of different fluid-flow rates between the shale's fracture network and intact matrix, there are two distinct pore-pressure fields in saturated fractured shale when subjected to stress and/or fluid-pressure perturbation. For example, in overbalanced drilling through a fractured-shale formation, the drilling mud penetrates the fractures immediately and there is no significant leakoff of fluid from the wellbore or from the fractures into the intact shale matrix. In other words, the fracture network with high permeability provides preferential flow paths for mud invasion into the formation. Consequently, we risk losing mud circulation and damaging the formation. In addition, the fluid invasion into the fractures weakens the mechanical strength of the shale such as cohesion and friction angle, as observed in laboratory shale testing. Furthermore, the communication between the fluid pressure in the fractures and wellbore mud pressure makes the formation more sensitive to every activity in the drilling operation such as stopping circulation, tripping, or drillstring impact. These events could create significant pressure variation in the fractures, leading to collapse failure consequences such as cavings and hole erosion.

AB  - AbstractAccording to the analysis on the 11 drilling holes and more than 600km stratigraphy profiles data in the Diaokou lobe of modern Yellow River delta, it is found that the modern Yellow River Delta deposits mainly consist of the coarse silt and other fine grains, the fast accumulation speed and the frequent watercourse change result in the overlap of the sand on the river mouth bar and the weak sediment layer on the side edge, causing the uneven internal structure of the delta. The strata that is squeezed and disturbed is prone to deformation, easily resulting in such instabilities as slide, clastic flow, collapse, seabed diapirs and so on. Therefore, the Yellow River Delta region becomes one of the regions with the most complex marine engineering conditions in the world.

AB  - ABSTRACT The paper studies damping of wind-induced instabilities, using circular cylindrical nutation dampers, through a comprehensive test program with three distinct phases. To begin with, a parametric study of the damper, in conjunction with frequency response tests, is carried out using a specially designed and instrumented Scotch-Yoke type of facility. It identifies important system variables contributing to significant energy dissipation. Results show that the optimum contributions of the system parameters can lead to an efficient damper, particularly if the operating conditions are conducive to wave-breaking. Next, visualization of the liquid sloshing modes, explaining the energy dissipation process at the fundamental level, is undertaken. It corroborates conclusions of the parametric study. Finally, wind tunnel tests with two-dimensional models substantiate, rather dramatically, the effectiveness of the nutation damper in arresting both vortex resonance and galloping-type instabilities. The damper continues to be effective even for the case when the structure is located in the wake of other structures, the situation frequently encountered in practice. A video successfully captured fluid dynamics of the damper and its effectiveness in arresting wind-induced instabilities. INTRODUCTION The response of aerodynamically bluff bodies when exposed to a fluid stream has been a subject of considerable study for quite some time. The prevention of fluid-elastic vibrations of marine platforms, risers, towed sonars as well as ground-based structures such as transmission lines, suspension bridges, tall buildings, etc. is of particular interest to engineers. Ever since the pioneering contribution by Strouhal, who correlated the periodicity of thevelocity of the fluid stream, there has been a continuous flow of important contributions resulting in a vast body of literature. A variety of devices has been developed to arrest vibrations. They may be classified as: • Spoilers, which tend to change fluid dynamic characteristics of structures in such a way as to interfere with and weaken the exciting force.

AB  - Abstract Drilling programs continue to push into new and more complicated environments. As a result, accurate measurement and analysis of drilling data in real time are becoming more critical by means of minimizing failure costs. The measurement of actual wellbore shape in real-time can be considered as one of the key components to detect problems such as borehole instability. Abnormal wellbore shape will allow drawing conclusions on the stress field. Accurate wellbore caliper measurements in real-time will also allow determining cement volume requirements with less measurement time. Measuring flow rate accurately behind the bit with ultrasonic sensor will also help the driller to detect washouts along drill string in real time. This paper describes experiments related to the accuracy of ultrasonic sensor measurements for estimation of wellbore diameter in drilling fluids with different mud weights and additives in real time. A fully automated test robot has been designed and tests have been performed in different drilling conditions. The test robot allows moving vertical as well as lateral movement of a sensor head in an artificial wellbore which can be run with different fluids. In addition, bubbles were added to the mud while measuring borehole diameter by the sensor. Tests have been performed in relation to the radial position of the caliper tool inside the wellbore, including different objects inside the borehole simulating latches or dog legs. The wellbore profiles have been measured with different axial and rotational surveying speeds. Numerical simulation of ultrasonic measurements and comparison of the results to the recorded data gives an estimate on the measurement accuracy at different RPMs of drill string. It is also shown that gas bubbles can be detected and compensated with an appropriate accuracy if circle fitting methods like the Kasa method in combination with robust error models are applied.   Introduction Recognition of variations in borehole shape in real-time drilling allow the drilling engineer to actuate appropriate counteractions to avoid costly failures, or to implement alterations in the drilling practices to optimize the shape of the borehole and thus improve the drilling efficiency. The received data help the driller to make proper decisions such as reaming a critical zone, changing the flow rate to reduce erosion or modifying the string rotation speed to reduce vibrations. Real time application of ultrasonic caliper tools also provides a method for calculating borehole volumes. On a final bit run for instance, the sensor may collect the caliper data during trip-out for the estimation of cement volumes. Other applications of ultrasonic caliper tools might include real time casing wear and borehole stability detection, evaluation of borehole cleaning and determination of tight spots or formation ledges (Maranuk et al., 1997). This paper reviews tests and experiments which have been performed by the ultrasonic sensor in drilling fluids with different mud weight. Effects of air bubbles on the recorded data by ultrasonic caliper were determined. However, even with the modern technology improvements, ultrasonic caliper cannot provide absolute reliable information for all drilling environments and conditions. Several operational factors such as tool centralization, mud density, borehole wall roughness, tool position, gas bubbles and drillstring vibration in the borehole among others need to be considered in order to optimize the accuracy of the borehole caliper data. For this reason analysis of circle fitting algorithms based on the Kasa method have been implemented.

AB  - ABSTRACT: Rock mass response to many geo-engineering problems may not be predicted by considering thermal, mechanical and fluid flow processes independently since geo-materials typically exhibit non-linear behavior. Hence a coupling of two or more processes may be required based on the extent of engineering problems involved. A ground freezing problem, has been described here as a special case of a coupled Thermo -Hydro-Mechanical (THM) process. A numerical code has been developed which takes into account the phase change of fluid in porous media. Simulation of temperature transfer and induced deformation have been carried out to assess the slope instability resulting from freezing and thawingRÉSUMÉ: La reaction de la masse rocheuse aux divers problèmes de gèo-ingènierie ne peuvent pas itre prèdits en considèrant le precèdè des flux thermique, mecanique et fluide indèpendamment, tels que les gèo-matèriaux demontrent habitu'ellement un comportement non-linèaire.

Geo-engineering problems involving coupled processes may be described with two broad headings based on whether fluid changes its phase during process or not. The application of the first categories of geo-engineering problems include nuclear waste repository (Amy & Rouset, 1994), reservoir engineering (Obdel-Hadi & Mitchell, 1981), etc. where phase change of fluid does not take place. 'The' second categories of problems are frozen ground problems that· require phase change of fluid to be taken into account. These are associated with in-ground liquefied natural gas (LNG) storage, slope instability resulting from freezing and thawing and other ground freezing problems in tunneling (Sanger, 1968). In the Himalayan kingdom of Nepal, Japan and elsewhere the natural process of freezing and thawing is thought to be responsible for a number of slope failures, slope deterioration and weathering. Since the natural process of freezing' and thawing involves thermal, mechanical and fluid flow processes, the response of rock masses to this geo-engineering problem requires coupled THM system to fully describe them.

Abstract A universal dimensionless scaling group for predicting the onset of hydrodynamic instability of a miscible displacement in porous media is presented. The scaling group takes into account a variable unperturbed concentration profile, the dimensions of the porous medium, the properties of the porous medium and the fluids contained therein. The linear perturbation analysis of Chuoke was extended in order to obtain perturbation analysis of Chuoke was extended in order to obtain the scaling group. The theory is verified by comparing it with miscible displacement experiments carried out in a Hele-Shaw cell. Moreover, a comparison of the theory with some porous medium experiments from the literature also supports porous medium experiments from the literature also supports the validity of the theory. Introduction Immiscible secondary recovery schemes, even when successful, may be inefficient because capillary forces act to entrap oil within the reservoir. This can prevent the recovery of significant amounts of oil. One way to avoid entrapping oil in this way is to use a displacement fluid which is miscible with the oil in the reservoir. However, such an approach, while improving the recovery efficiency in the part of the reservoir contacted by the displacement fluid, may still be inefficient on an overall basis because of early breakthrough of the solvent and because of poor volumetric sweep efficiency. These two problems arise as a result of the phenomenon of viscous fingering which comes about due to hydrodynamic instability of the displacement front Thus, there is a need, when designing a miscible displacement process, to be able to predict whether the displacement is stable or unstable.

AB  - AbstractGas-lift wells can be unstable due to various reasons. The fluctuating, and sometimes chaotic unstable production behavior affects many offshore fields, particularly at their decline stages. The hazardousness of the flucuation to operation safety and smoothness has been awared. But the production reduction due to the instabilities has not been widely addressed. In this paper, a commercial available dynamical multiphase flow simulator is used to conduct investigation on the production loss. Two types of instabilities, casing heading and density wave instability, which both can result in production loss are simulated. Two hypothetic wells, abstracted from typical North Sea gas-lift wells, are built within the simulator. Parametric simulation study is then performed by changing the well settings. The average production rate of the unstable well can be obtained from the simulation and compared with the steady state prediction. The difference of the two results gives the production loss due to instability. Furthermore, the paper presents simulation results of applying feedback control to the unstable wells. The production loss is reduced as an effect of stabilization by feedback control.IntroductionGas-lift is one of the most widely used artificial lift method in oil production. Economically optimised gas-lift design requires that gas-lift wells be operated at the up-slope of their lift performance relationship curve[7]. This leads the gravity effect becomes the dominant factor of gas and liquid two-phase flow in the tubing. Two-phase vertical flow under gravity domination is often unstable. This is particularly true in the gas-lift wells. The instabilities of gas-lift can either be marcroscopic or microscopic. By marcroscopic, we mean that the instability has a systematic background. And by microscopic on the other hand, we refer to the local instability such as hydrodynamic slugging, which is not considered as an operation problem in most situations except that it might be amplified by other factors. Normally, it is the marcroscopic instability that results in the severe unstable flow in the wells. For many years, it has been observed that continueous gas-lift wells can be seriously unstable and sometimes even behave as an intermittent gas-lift due to instabilities with systematic background. Large fluctuation in the well flow rate can result in poor separation, limit the production capacity and cause flaring and shutdown.Besides the operation problems, production loss is another important issue for unstable gas-lift wells. The field tail production will be prolonged due to the reduced production rate since it will take more time to get the same recovery. This will tremendously increase the cost of operation. The concentraion of this paper is to investigate the gas-lift instability resulted production loss since this has not been widely addressed and caused enough attention. Particularly, when the downstream receiving facitlity and process can handle the flow fluctuation, one seldom has the motivation to deal with it. Therefore, the production reduction is ignored. This paper emphasizes the notion that production loss is the norm for oscillating wells and the instabilities have to be seriously treated even when they do not cause any operation problem. It also demonstrates that the pragmatic method such as static choking performed by skilled operators can only stabilize the well at a cost of large production reduction. However, dynamical choking based on feedback control can not only stabilize the well but also save part of the production loss. Thus, the advantage of applying feedback control to suitable unstable wells is promoted.Gas-lift InstabilitiesTwo systematic instability mechanisms that can result in serious unstable phonomena are discussed in this paper. One is casing heading, in which the gas injection through gas-lift valve is non-critical and annulus flow dynamics is involved in the instability. Another mechanism is called density wave instability, in which the gas injection is critical and thus flow in annulus is isolated from any instability taking place in the tubing. Since this instability has never been discussed in prtroleum gas-lift application, we borrow this name from the similar phenomenon observed in airlift pumps that are often used in the mining industry[8][12].

AB  - Abstract For the oil and gas exploitation in deep waters, e.g. the continental slopes at South China Sea, the seabed slope would have influence on the pipeline on-bottom stability. In this study, an actuator-driven pipe-soil interaction facility has been specially designed and constructed, for full-scale physical modeling of the current-induced pipeline instability on a sloping sand-bed, including upward instability and downward instability. Based on dimensionless analyses, an ultimate lateral-soil-resistance coefficient is proposed to describe the pipe-soil interaction, and a series of tests have been conducted to reveal the mechanism of pipe instability on a sloping sand-bed. Experimental results indicate that, sand-bed slope angle, pipe's submerged weight and end-constraints have much effect on the pipe stability on a sloping sand-bed. Introduction As more and more deepwater oil/gas fileds have been recently found at the continental slope of South China Sea (SCS), the stability of deepwater pipelines on a sloping seabed attracts much attention from the engineering designers and researchers. The seabed in SCS holds rich varieties of its topographic feature including the vast continental shelf, the continental slope and deep sea basin. At the continental slope of SCS, the water depth is generally between 150 to 3,500 meters, and the seabed slope angle changes much at various locations, e.g., the slope angle ranges from 2 to 4 degree at the lower continental slope of northern SCS, and ranges from 3.2 to 7.8 degree at the lower continental slope of southern SCS (Liu et al., 2002). Nevertheless, the influential factor of seabed sloping angle has not been involved in the existing design codes or recommended practices regarding the pipeline on-bottom stability (see, Det Norske Veritas, 2007) To avoid the occurrence of pipeline on-bottom instability, i.e. the the pipe breakouts from its original site, the seabed must provide enough soil resistance to balance the hydrodynamic loads upon the untrenched pipeline. The pipeline on-bottom stability involves a complex pipe-soil interaction process. Since the 1980s, mechanical actuator experiments have been carried out and some pipe-soil interaction models were proposed to predict pipeline stability induced by the ocean wave in shallow waters (e.g., Wagner et al., 1987; Brenodden, et al., 1989; Zhang, et al., 2002; Teh et al., 2003). As the oil and gas exploitation moving into deeper waters, ocean current becomes the prevailing hydrodynamic load upon submarine pipelines. For describing the current-induced pipeline lateral stability, Gao et al. (2007) conducted a series of flume tests and established an empirical relationship between the dimensionless submerged weight of pipeline and Froude number. Recently, pipe-soil interaction mechanism for steady flow-induced instability of a partially embedded pipeline was further investigated experimentally by employing mechanical actuator to simulate hydrodynamic loads on the pipe (Gao et al., 2011). Nevertheless, the aforementioned studies focused mainly on pipeline on-bottom stability on the horizontal seabed. The effect of seabed slope angle on the pipeline on-bottom stability is far from being well understood. In this experimental study, the pipeline on-bottom stability on a sloping sandy seabed is investigated with a novel pipe-soil interaction facility, which is capable of modeling the prototype-size pipeline (diameter from 0.2 up to 0.5 m) on an inclined seabed with the slope from 0 to 30 degree. The effects of seabed slope, pipe submered weight and end-constraint on the pipeline on-bottom stability are investigated experimentally.

AB  - AbstractThis paper presents a dimensionless number and its critical value for predicting the onset of instability during immiscible displacement in porous media. The critical dimensionless number obtained from a stability theory for a cylindrical system successfully predicted the onset of instability in laboratory floods. Therefore, this number can be used to classify the stability of two-phase incompressible displacements in homogeneous porous media. IntroductionWhen a fluid displaces a more viscous fluid, the displacement front may become unstable, resulting in viscous fingering. This phenomenon raises both practical and theoretical concerns. Apart from further reducing the displacement efficiency of an already inefficient displacement arrangement, instability may invalidate the usual method of simulating immiscible displacement performance based on relative permeability and capillary pressure concepts. Also, it introduces an additional scaling requirement for using model tests to forecast prototype displacement results. Therefore, it would be most beneficial to predict the onset of instability, so as to avoid viscous fingering, or, where it is unavoidable, to be able to recognize it as a factor in the displacement. The onset of instability call be predicted by a stability analysis of the displacement. The objective of such an analysis is to determine the conditions under which small disturbances or perturbations of the displacement front will grow to become viscous fingers. Ideally, the analysis should give a universal dimensionless scaling group together with its critical value above which instability will occur. The stability classification then would entail no more than the calculation of one dimensionless number in a manner analogous to the calculation of a Reynolds number to distinguish between laminar and turbulent flow. Several stability studies of immiscible displacement have been reported in the literature. Collectively, they show that these variables are pertinent to the stability problem: (1) mobility (or viscosity) ratio, (2) displacement velocity, system geometry and dimensions, (3) capillary and gravitational forces, and (4) system permeability and wettability. However, none of the previous studies have combined these variables into one dimensionless number that can be used to quantify the stability classification. The objective of this study was to obtain, by means of a stability analysis, a universal dimensionless scaling group and its critical value for predicting the onset of instability during immiscible displacement in porous media. This paper shows how the stability theory of Chuoke et al. was extended to achieve this objective and presents the results of laboratory floods that confirm the predicted onset of instability in cylindrical cores. Theory The pertinent dimensionless number for predicting the onset of instability was obtained by extending the stability theory of Chuoke et al. Their theory was based on a piston-like unperturbed displacement model in which the oil and water zones are separated by a planar interface. Details of the theory and our extension of it are presented in the following sections. SPEJ P. 249^

AB  - Abstract As a bottleneck problem, borehole instabilities have  severely restricted further development and application of gas drilling technology. Here, the mechanisms of borehole instabilities in gas drilling are studied and four instability mechanisms are presented, including mechanical instability of weak rocks or crumbliness rocks because of their  low mechanical strength,  mechanics-chemical coupling instability caused by production or injection of fluid,  rock burst of payzone and  dynamically instability of overlying mudstone with pressure during hi-speed production. Because gas drilling has special operating conditions compared with conventional drilling, the experiment simulating field operating conditions is crucial to evaluation of borehole stability in gas drilling and need relate to more evaluating parameters, including formation temperature, pore pressure, overlying pressure, confining pressure, borehole pressure, types and production of formation fluid, velocity of slide wave as well as drilling operation, including dry gas drilling, foam or liquid drilling and conversion process of gas-liquid drilling operation. Meanwhile, deepening study on the mechanisms and evaluation methods of borehole instabilities, improving treating agents and treating process and advancing forecasting technique and sealing technique of formation fluid are thought of as effective  approaches of enhancing borehole stability in gas drilling.  This will be helpful for understanding the mechanisms of borehole instabilities in gas drilling and improving evaluation methods. Introduction To deep oil-gas reservoir or unconventional oil-gas reservoir, gas drilling has immense advantage [1-4]. However, with further expansion of application as well as more complexity faced with geological object, borehole stabilities has become a bottleneck problem severely restricting further development and application of gas drilling. Because of encountering producing pay, fluid-producing, including water-producing, oil-producing and gas-producing, make instability mechanisms become more complexity.

AB  - Abstract System instability prediction is essential when designing a production system and/or providing operational adjustment to maintain a stable production. The conventional system Nodal Analysis articulates that the system is unstable to the left of the minimum of the Outflow Performance Relationship (OPR) curve where the well loads up. However, recent data shows that there are stable production points on the left of the minimum of the OPR curve, especially for low permeability shale plays. In this work, a new practical model is presented for both conventional and unconventional wells using Nodal Analysis with a novel approach. The new approach is based on the derivative analysis of the inflow performance relationship (IPR) and OPR at a nodal point of the bottom hole. Perturbation analysis is used to facilitate the explanation of the new model. It shows that the system is stable when the absolute value of slopes or derivatives of the IPR is greater than that of OPR. To evaluate this concept, transient numerical simulations were conducted using a commercial transient simulator at various IPR conditions, including different permeabilities, for both vertical and horizontal wells. Meanwhile, the concept is also compared with available experimental and field data. The transient simulation and the available data presented in this study demonstrate that there are stable production operating points on the left of the minimum of the OPR curve. The system stability also depends on the reservoir permeability, i.e., the flow rate corresponding to the onset of instability decreases with decreasing permeability. The new approach predicts this trend well. Overall, the new model matches well with observation from the experiments, field data, and the transient numerical simulations.

AB  - ABSTRACTAn amine treating system operating for eight years without corrosion started to experience equipment integrity failures and severe corrosion. A preliminary investigation reviewed the process data and recommended re-commisioning an amine reclaimer, installing online corrosion monitoring equipment to relate corrosion rates to process changes and executing corrosion tests to determine the influence of H2S lean loading, CO2 lean loading, amine residue levels, amine solution velocity and organic acids on corrosion in lean amine systems. The results of the online corrosion monitoring and the laboratory testing showed that process stability has a major influence on the corrosion rate. INTRODUCTIONProcess DescriptionThe Caroline Gas Plant has two identical trains (Train 1 and Train 2) in order to process sour gas containing 37 mol% H2S and 7 mol% CO2 with the gas-treating unit in each train consisting of two different amine systems. The amine system that will be discussed in this paper is a Sulfinol-D Process (1) that originally contained 25% water, 25% Sulfolane(1) and 50% DIPA (di-isopropanol amine) by weight and now has a significant amount (~10%) of MDEA (methyldiethanol amine). This particular system will be referred to as amine in the rest of the paper. This amine system receives a combined gas (containing approximately 21 mol% H2S and 5 mol% CO2), which enters the contactor below the bottom tray and is counter-currently contacted with lean amine entering above tray 39. The contactor contains 39 trays due to the high COS (carbonyl sulfide) and mercaptan levels in the feed gas with the target acid gas loading of 0.8 mol acid gas / mol amine. The pressure of the rich amine is decreased prior to entry into the flash drum. Any co-absorbed hydrocarbon flashes off the rich solution and is sweetened with lean amine in the flash gas contactor. The remaining rich amine is heated by the hot lean solution from the bottom of the regenerator in two exchangers prior to entry into the regenerator. The H2S, CO2, COS and mercaptan are stripped from the solution with steam which is generated by reboiling the liquid at the bottom of the column in two kettle type reboilers using 500 kPag steam. An amine reclaimer without an overhead reflux system operating at the regenerator pressure was installed and commissioned in 1993 to remove solution degradation products. Operating difficulties resulted in the shut down of the unit in 1996. However, the unit was revamped and re-commissioned in 2003 and has been running successfully ever since, first reclaiming Train 2 and then eventually reclaiming Train 1.

AB  - Summary Numerous time-dependent wellbore-instability problems have been reported while drilling through the chemically active fractured-shale formations in the Arabian Gulf. Very often, these shales are characterized by the abundance of not only macroscale bedding planes but also networks of microscale natural fractures. The presence of fractures weakens the shale mechanically and produces higher-permeability fluid-flow paths within the low-permeability rock formation. Because of different fluid-diffusion rates between the fractures and shale matrix, there are two distinct pore-pressure fields in saturated fractured shale. Additionally, in chemically active shale formations, osmotic pressure arises because of the imbalance in mud/shale chemical activity. Practically, it is extremely complex to isolate the fractures from the matrix for analysis or to identify fracture size and fracture density. However, a first-order approach in an attempt to understand the porous fractured-shale behavior is to use dual-porosity and dual-permeability theory of poromechanics in the analytical modeling. In this study, a poromechanical inclined-wellbore solution has been derived that incorporates time dependency, a primary porosity and permeability for the matrix, a secondary porosity and permeability for the fractures, and the chemical effect. The expressions for the stresses and pressure solutions are presented and detailed in Appendix A. These analytical solutions are used to simulate an inclined-wellbore-stability problem in a fractured-shale formation, accounting also for bedding planes in some instances in addition to the microfractures. Additionally, retrieved rock samples of fractured shale were tested by use of an innovative laboratory characterization device, the Inclined Direct Shear Testing Device (IDSTD) (PoroMechanics Institute; Norman, Oklahoma; 2008). This device tests tiny shale specimens (rock volume less than 0.14 in.3) and is capable of measuring cohesion and friction angle while the sample is subjected to in-situ stresses, varying mud pressures, and mud-circulation times.

AB  - The pdf file of this paper is in Russian. Abstract The idea explored is that gas lift may be stabilized by imposed oscillations. This has been experimentally investigated in a scaled-down facility where water is lifted by air. An air-tank provides compressibility emulating a gas filled annulus. Depending on pipe dimension, injection rate and tank volume, the flow may be stable, or oscillate similarily to casing heading in full-size wells. To control natural oscillations, their dominating frequency was firstly determined. Destructive interference was then imposed by cyclic variation of either the downhole injection valve, or the tubing outlet valve. By injection valve regulation, the flow was stabilized and 40% higher liquid rate obtained. Outlet choke regulation also stabilized the flow, but rate improvement less, up to 13%. Scaled-down facilities should be viewed with sobriety. However, the facility appears to exhibits static and dynamic behavior similar to real wells, so the experimental results may be lent some credibility. This may provide a new and simpler approach to control of gas lift instability.

AB  - ABSTRACT: Wellbore instability problems play major rule in the increasing of the non-productive time (NPT) during drilling processes. In most cases, this cost can be reduced by designing a suitable operational window using geomechanical models. Several wellbore instability problems have been encountered during drilling Nahr Umr formation in an oil field in southern Iraq. These problems are including, but not limited to, mechanical stuck, caving, and tight holes. Data from more than twenty wells (vertical and deviated wells) are investigated to reveal the major factors that control the instability problems and to design an optimum mud window. In the present work, a 1-D mechanical earth model (MEM) was constructed using numerous field data for Nahr Umr formation. Based on the offset well data, open hole wireline logging measurements (e.g., density logs, gamma ray (GR) logs, sonic logs, formation micro-imager (FMI) logs, porosity logs, resistivity logs, drilling records, and mud logs (master logs)) the magnitude and orientations of the in-situ principal stresses, pore pressure, and rock mechanical properties were estimated. The 1-D-MEM was verified and calibrated using all the available data (i.e., drilling observations, caliper logs, results of image data interpretation, repeated formation test (RFT), hydraulic fracturing, and laboratory rock mechanical properties, etc.) such that it robustly and accurately predicts shear failure around given wellbores. The generated model was then coupled with three failure criteria (i.e., Mohr-Coulomb, Mogi-Coulomb, and Modified Lade) to analyze the existing wellbore stability problems for wells with directional profiles and to determine the appropriate mud weight to drill a well in any desired direction. Our analysis shows that the majority of the wellbore instability problems are mainly caused by; rock failure around the wellbore due to high stresses and low rock strength, and inappropriate drilling practice.INTRODUCTIONDespite the modern advancements and the usage of new technology in the oil and gas industry, wellbore instability remains one of the most challenging aspects in terms of the cost to drill and complete a well. Eight billion dollars are spent each year due to wellbore instability problems (Peng, 2007), causing an increase in the drilling budget by 10% (Aadnoy, 2003). Therefore, wellbore stability is considered to be one of the major stages of well planning and has been studied extensively (Bell, 2003; Bradley, 1979; Ding, 2011; Zhang et al., 2003; Zhang et al., 2009; Gentzis et al., 2009; Alsubaih et al., 2017; Abbas et al., 2018).

AB  - AbstractDeep water field developments have introduced a new set of general conditions which can significantly affect the design of subsea pipelines compared to more conventional water depths experienced in the past. Deep water pipelines do not require a concrete weight coating due to the low wave and current loads, as a result these pipelines have a lower submerged weight. This combined with the lower resistance provided bythe soft soil found on the sea bed in deep water have resulted in pipelines being more susceptable to movements both in the lateral and axial directions as a result of pressure and temperature driven loads. Consequenthly the instability ofpipelines on the sea bed induced by pressure and temperature effects have taken a much larger importance. This paper will compare a range of solutions which can be used to mitigate these issues of lateral buckling and pipe walking, which can cumulated their effect and induce fatigue failures of the pipeline. The paper will be based upon the practical experienced gain in implementing these mitigation measures in deep water projedcts in West Africa. Based upon an understanding of the instability mechanisms and the practical aspects of installation, each mitigation method will be discussed and the impact on pipeline design, installation, and project cost and planning will be highlighted.IntroductionThe expansion of submarine pipelines under the influence of pressure and temperature is not a new subject area for the design of pipelines, risers and tie-in spools. However, previously, the issues were mainly concerned with the displacements of the pipe ends and the resulting stresses and strains in the pipe wall. In addition for trenched and buried pipelines the issues of up-heaval buckling have required specific attention in recent years. It is important to note that the pipe end displacements under these conditions can be considered to be more or less reversible. That is the expansion of the pipeline experienced during production start up is more or less equal to the retraction of the pipeline during a shut down situation. This paper deals with a relatively new phenomena influencing deep water flowlines layed directly on the seabed, where the displacements induced by pressure and temperature variations can result in progressive and cumulative movements of the pipeline. The factors influencing the progressive movements include :- Constant and asymmetrical tension applied to the pipeline from a Steel Catenary Riser (SCR) Relatively lightweight pipelines due to the absence of a concrete weight coating and use of insulation coatings which can have specific gravity less than 1.0. ?Short in field flowlines, consequently the whole line is affected by the pressure and temperature displacements . In general deep water soils are very soft with a highwater content and consequently provide relatively little resistance to pipeline movements. The conditions described above for deep water flowlines can result in two different types of displacements.

AB  - Unstable flow condition is a limitation for production optimization in continuous gas-lift wells due to casing and tubing heading. The instability could be caused due to insufficient gas injection volume, incorrect port diameter size, and variation of gas-lift injection rate due to subcritical flow condition at the point of operation. The traditional square-edge orifice valve is a cylindrical channel used to transport the gas. To reach critical flow condition, the downstream pressure has to be 50% to 40% the upstream pressure, and cannot be used to eliminate instability due to the excessive pressure differential required to achieve this flow regime. Therefore, a new valve was developed, which has the advantage to reach sonic flow velocity when pressure differential is only 10%, due to its converging diverging flow geometry. Comparing the dynamic flow performance of both square-edge and Nova valve, the Nova is independent of the downstream pressure and ideal as means of eliminating upstream instability.Around 4200 wells currently operates under continuous gas-lift in Lake Maracaibo and 5% to 10% of these operates at unstable flow conditions due to subsonic flow at the injection point. For this reason PDVSA E&P decided to carry out field tests using a new gas-lift stabilization valve called Nova or nozzle-Venturi valve in wells with emulsion problems, high water content or low differential pressure across the operating valve which causes casing and tubing heading. There were installed 7 Nova valves in wells with crude oil gravity ranging from 14° API to 30° API, producing from 300 blpd to 2000 blpd, gas injection volumes of 500 Mscfd to 2000 Mscfd, and as deep as 12000 feet.The well test results indicate that this new technology could stabilize the gas injection volume eliminating the casing heading and minimizing fluctuations of the tubing pressures. The potential application of this new valve in Lake Maracaibo oscillates between 300 to 400 wells. It is the scope of this work to present the selection criteria used to choose the well candidates, the results and experience gained during the field tests.

AB  - Abstract Saudi Aramco workover re-entry operations within Khafji sand stringers are widespread across Zuluf field. These horizontal sidetracks maintain maximum reservoir contact and introduce substantial increases in oil production and ultimate recovery. Wellbore instability is a hot topic surrounding these operations due to the presence of geo- and hydro pressurized shale within the reservoir. The in-situ stress regime in this field is predominantly strike-slip faulting and the drilling azimuth represents a dominant stability component. The current study analyzes 58 laterals sidetracked across the Khafji formation across Zuluf field, and the effect of the drilling azimuth on wellbore stability. All laterals were cut across 7 in. casings and drilled as 6-1/8 in. open hole, with an average of 4,200 ft. in length. To accurately evaluate these data, the azimuth plane was divided into four angular regions, with respect to the maximum and minimum principal horizontal stresses: maximum stress (17 laterals), transitional maximum stress (12 laterals), transitional minimum stress (14 laterals) and minimum stress (15 laterals). Stuck pipe and severe tight-hole problems are mainly addressed for this purpose, as they are the main wellbore instability signs in this case. The descriptive correlational approach showed that nearly 63% of the total stuck pipe and lateral abandonment incidents occurring due to shale bedding and instability, were actually along the minimum horizontal stress. Furthermore, 53% of the laterals drilled along the minimum horizontal stress experienced wellbore shale instability with either stuck pipe or severe tight holes. Hence, the findings confirm the sensitivity of wellbore stability to the drilling azimuth in strike-slip regions. They also suggest a statistically significant correlation between laterals drilled along the minimum principal horizontal stress and wellbore instability problems across Khafji reservoir in Zuluf field. This paper will further highlight the descriptive correlational method, examine the observed wellbore instability problems, and compare the findings to previously conducted laboratory tests and geomechanical simulations.

Rahman, SPE, Australian Petroleum Cooperative Research Centre, Centre for Petroleum Engineering, U of New South Wales, Kensington, AustraliaAbstractThis paper describes the fundamental concept and a model of the chemical potential mechanism and the associated effective mud support change as the drilling fluid interacts with the shale. By having the chemical potential of the drilling fluid to be lower than the potential of the formation, pore fluid can be induced to flow from the formation into the wellbore which will result in a reduction of the near-wellbore pore pressure. This in turn will lead to an increase in effective mud support and consequently, a more stable condition at the wellbore wall.The model was verified with laboratory experiments designed for the study of the chemical potential mechanism. The results showed that osmotic flow of pore fluid from the formation across a non-ideal semi-permeable membrane would only provide a temporary shale stabilisation mechanism. A parametric study was carried out using the verified model to demonstrate the effects of critical drilling fluid properties on time-dependent pore pressure change due to the difference between drilling fluid and formation chemical potentials and the associated wellbore (in)stability in shales for water-based muds.The model provides a fundamental basis for understanding the effects of the type, concentration and chemical properties of the salt, drilling fluid properties, and reflection coefficient of the shale on time-dependent mud support on the wellbore wall.IntroductionWellbore instability, experienced mainly in shale sections, is one of the principal causes of drilling delays and in some cases, even suspension of wells prior to reaching the target. These instabilities may be induced by either in-situ stresses that are high relative to the strength of the formations or physico-chemical interactions of the drilling fluid with the shales. The instability induced by drilling fluid-shale interactions can be managed more efficiently through a better understanding and development of a capacity to model the pore pressure change due to chemical potential difference between the drilling fluid and the shale, and subsequent wellbore (in)stability due to the interactions. Coupled chemical potential mechanism has been studied as a method of stabilising shales drilled with water-based muds.This paper describes the fundamental concept and a model of the chemical potential mechanism and the associated effective mud support change as the drilling fluid interacts with the shale. The model was verified with laboratory experiments designed for the study of the chemical potential mechanism.Analyses were carried out using the verified model to demonstrate the effects of critical drilling fluid properties on time-dependent pore pressure change due to the difference between drilling fluid and formation chemical potentials and the associated wellbore (in)stability in shales for water-based muds.Fundamental Concept of Chemical Potential MechanismFlow of water into or out of shales is somewhat similar in mechanism to the flow of water through a semi-permeable membrane (osmosis). Osmosis is the flow of solvent (water) from a solution containing lower concentration of solute (salinity) into a solution of higher solute concentration through a membrane that is permeable to the solvent but not to the solute. The pressure required to prevent water from moving through a semi-permeable membrane from a solution of low salinity to a solution of high salinity is called osmotic pressure. The driving forces involved in solute and solvent transport through a membrane are the chemical potential gradients across the membrane.P. 107

AB  - ABSTRACT:This study uses numerical modeling to determine the possibility of an edifice collapse at the active Pacaya Volcano in Guatemala. Stability analyses using the Limit Equilibrium Method (LEM) and the Finite Element Method (FEM) were performed on the south-western flank using the physical-mechanical material properties of Pacaya’s intact rocks and rock mass characteristics based on field observations and laboratory tests. The Hoek and Brown failure criterion was used to calculate the friction angle, cohesion, and rock mass parameters in a determined stress range. Volcanic instability was assessed based on the variability of the Factor of Safety and Shear Strength Reduction using deterministic, sensitivity, and probabilistic analyses considering static conditions. Results indicate the volcanic slope is stable under gravity alone, but the possible presence of a layer of pyroclastics significantly reduces the stability of the slope. Future work will focus on verifying the presence of this layer and evaluating the effect of external loading mechanisms such as earthquake load and magma pressure on the slope stability at Pacaya.1. INTRODUCTIONVolcanic landslides, which have caused over 20,000 fatalities in the past 400 years [1], are extremely hazardous geologic processes due to their size and velocity. These events can travel at speeds of 50 to 150m/s [2, 3], containing several cubic kilometers of debris and traveling tens of kilometers away from the volcano. Since the sector collapse and associated lateral eruption of Mount St. Helens in 1980, there has been a surge of interest in volcanic collapse mechanisms and collapse evidence. Collapses have now been reported at 400 volcanoes around the world, of which 21 have had a large-volume landslide (>0.1 km³) since 1500 A.D. [4]. Besides the direct impacts on nearby communities due to debris avalanches and associated lahars, they also increase the risk of explosive and/or lateral eruptions.

AB  - AbstractIn the pursuit of greater productivity, Petrobras has been using increasingly ESP (Electric Submersible Pump) on its wells, especially on heavy oil fields, in which the gaslift method is not as effective as that system. However, since the ESP MTTF (Mean Time to Failure) is not greater than two and a half years, major offshore operators have been looking for new technologies that can reduce intervention time and costs. Deepwater Pumping Modules (MoBo) are an excellent alternative for that. The system consists of an ESP installed on a caisson located on the sea bed. This module allows not only for faster interventions when compared to conventional ESP (inside the well), but also admit ESP workover without interrupting production (by using gas-lift as a contingence).On the other hand, Pumping Modules (MoBo) have inherent constructive characteristics that may lead to a great extent of liquid-gas separation. The geometry of those systems has a downward annular flow that can contribute not only for instabilities such as severe slugs, but also to an excessive gas fraction at pump intake, causing the phenomenon known as gas-lock.This study intends to characterize the fluid-dynamic behavior of Pumping Modules through the use of a multiphase transient approach. This model has been developed using a 1-D multiphase transient software and it has been validated through an extensive comparison with real field data. To accomplish that, data were collected from online instrumentation and production tests to be used as validation parameters. Finally, due to the highly tri-dimensional characteristics of the flow, a validation against a substantially more refined 3-D model has been run.After model validation, a study was conducted in order to map possible operational conditions, determining whether the system would be stable or not under certain boundary conditions. That study has helped Petrobras to predict possible unsuitable behavior prior to new installations, as well as to define optimum operational conditions of wells during their production life. As a conclusion, the validated model shows to be a useful tool for flow assurance studies in those scenarios.

AB  - AbstractIn recognising the petroleum industry's need for a technology to design optimal drilling fluid (weight, type and chemistry) to solve and manage shale instability problems, a collaborative project has been undertaken to develop the technology which will provide the basis for state-of-the-ant drilling fluid design criteria. The key drilling fluid-shale interaction mechanisms included in the study are mud pressure penetration, chemical potential and swelling-hydrational stress.Fundamental concepts, processes, models and a range of novel test equipment and procedures for laboratory simulation of the mechanisms were developed. The laboratory test results were used in the refinement and verification of the models. The verified models, which have been integrated in a wellbore stability analysis software, were used to conduct analyses to demonstrate the effects of shale and drilling fluid properties on time-dependent wellbore (in)stability.The understanding of the drilling fluid-shale interaction mechanisms and the development of the capacity to model them enabled the development of drilling fluid design charts. These charts, together with a shale property database and property correlations, provide a pragmatic and effective approach for designing optimal drilling fluids to manage shale instability efficiently.P. 291

AB  - AbstractPlanning teams need confidence that the numerical tools they use to estimate potential for mine instability are sufficient to quantify the hazards. The tools must be quantitative, field validated, and the hazardous phenomena must emerge in these models as a function of the governing physics.In seismically active mines, this essential task is more difficult as high rates of deformation and dynamic loading are still comparatively infrequent events. Reliable simulation of support and reinforcement for dynamic loading is even more complex.The goal of this paper is to summarize a framework that has been used for reliable numerical rock mechanics simulation at several mines for forecasting of potential for induced seismicity.1. IntroductionFrom an engineering perspective, the mining engineer designing ground support and excavations in a mine must undertake two broad tasks:– Estimation of the potential for dynamic deformation and seismic events, including appreciating the mechanisms by which damage may occur to an excavation, including both rapidly (dynamically) increasing dilation of the rock mass due to increasing stress as well as the effects of seismic waves.– Simulation of the response of installed support and the discontinuous rock mass around the excavation.The only way to simulate significant excavation loading, deformation and energy change is to properly capture the physics of rock damage. If the extent and magnitude of the damage in the model is wrong, the displacements and energy changes, including estimates of seismic potential will also be wrong. The complete stress-strain behaviour of rock must be correctly captured.A tool that can correctly forecast the rock mass behaviour on different length scales should include:– The ability to incorporate explicit defects down to the length scale of interest.– The strain softening, dilatant behaviour of the rock mass.– The simulation of post-failure response of rock and support.The modelling framework discussed in this paper attempts to satisfy these requirements. It consists of a constitutive model that describe the stress-strain behaviour of rock masses and structures and the application of an explicit Finite Element (FE) algorithm to represent the rockmass as a three-dimensional discretized volume with discontinuities and heterogeneous material domains. The main ingredients are:– The continuum regions of the rockmass are modelled as strain-softening dilatant materials. This means that as strain increases the material softens, weakens, and dilates. All parameters can vary at different rates with respect to strain changes, and this allows approximation of complex stress-strain behaviour of real rock masses. A generalization of the Hoek-Brown yield criterion (Hoek et al., 1992) is used for the continuous regions of the rockmass derived from a more generic and versatile formulation of (Menetrey&;Willam, 1995).– The behaviour of explicit discontinuities is approximated using cohesive elements. The constitutive behaviour of the cohesive elements can be defined using the presented constitutive model, or a constitutive model specified directly in terms of traction versus separation.– The seismic potential of the modelled rock mass can be assessed by considering the modelled Rate of Energy Release (RER), which is the maximum instantaneous rate of energy release within a unit volume during a period of the simulation.

AB  - ABSTRACT: This paper presents a fully coupled reservoir-geomechanics model with erosion mechanics to address wellbore instability phenomena associated with sand production within the framework of mixture theory. A Representative Elementary Volume (REV) is chosen to comprise of five phases, namely solid grains (s), fluidized solids (fs), oil fluid (f), water (w) and gas (g). The particle transport and balance equations are written to reflect the interactions among phases in terms of mechanical stresses and hydrodynamics. Constitutive laws (mass generation law, Darcy's law, and stress-strain relationships) are written to describe the fundamental behaviour of sand erosion, fluid flow, and deformation of the solid skeleton respectively. Subsequently, the resulting governing equations are solved numerically using Galerkin's method with a generic nonlinear Newton-Raphson iteration scheme. Numerical examples in a typical light oil reservoir are presented to illustrate the capabilities of the proposed model in the absence of the gas phase. It is found that there is an intimate interaction between sand erosion activity and deformation of the solid matrix. As erosion activity progresses, porosity increases and in turn degrades the material strength. Strength degradation leads to an increased propensity for plastic shear failure that further magnifies the erosion activity. An escalation of plastic shear deformations will inevitably lead to instability with the complete erosion of the sand matrix. The self-adjusted mechanism enables the model to predict both the volumetric sand production and the propagation of wormholes, and hence instability phenomena in the wellbore. 1. INTRODUCTIONThe production of formation sand has plagued the oil and gas industry for decades because of its adverse effects on wellbore stability and equipment, while it has also been proven to be a most effective way to increase well productivity. When hydrocarbon production occurs from shallow and geologically young (or so-called unconsolidated / weakly consolidated) formations that have little or no cementation to hold the sand particles together, the interaction of fluid pressure and stresses within the porous granular material can lead to the mechanical failure of the formation and unwanted mobilization of sand. It has been reported that 10%- 40% sand cuts normally stabilize in time to levels less than 5% in heavy oil reservoirs [1], while an average of 40% productivity increase was achieved through sand management in light oil reservoirs [2]. When sand is produced from reservoir formations, it can cause a number of problems. These include the instability of wellbores, the erosion of pipes, the plugging of production liners, the subsidence of surface ground, and the need for disposal of sand in an environmentally acceptable manner. Each year, these issues cost the oil industry hundreds of millions of dollars. Furthermore, sand production and control becomes extremely crucial in offshore operations where a very low tolerance to sand production is allowed. Hence, it is imperative to find an efficient computational model that has the predictive capability to assist field operators to understand this unique process. The ultimate goal is to design an economical well-production strategy in which sand production and operating costs may be reduced to some extent with maximum hydrocarbon productivity.

AB  - ABSTRACT: Numerical modelling of stresses in the rock mass around a diapir was conducted using the finite difference code by the Itasca Consulting Group, Inc. A salt diapir of typical simplified (generalised) axisymmetric geometry was modeled, and the effects of grid zone size (discretization), stress regime, salt and surrounding rock mechanical properties were analysed. The results showed that stress perturbations around the diapir were in good agreement with the published data. Also an actual salt dome geometry from the Mungo field, Central North Sea was modeled, input data for the diapir geometry was obtained using the seismic survey data. These original ASCII data were pre-processed using the Surfer software package by applying a square surface gridding algorithm. This was necessary allowing sharp spikes on the original surface of the diapir to be smoothed. The Mungo model was run using the same mechanical properties for the salt and the surrounding rock mass as were used in the generalized model. The results of the computations agree well with those found in literature showing a lowering of hoop stress and raised radial stress in the vicinity of the diapir, which results in higher deviatoric stress and hence greater potential for borehole instability. The model can be useful in borehole failure risk assessment with a potential to improve drilling efficiency, reduce downtime, etc. by planning the boreholes so that their trajectories avoid the areas of high risk as much as practicable. 1. INTRODUCTIONUnder high pressure, salt (evaporite rock) deforms as a viscous material and behaves as an intrusive body piercing or folding overlying sediments, leading to a structure known geologically as a salt diapir. Salt diapirs, or salt domes as they are often called, are characterised by their prominent shape as illustrated in Figures 1.1 and 1.2. They play an important part in salt production, sulphur production, underground gas and toxic waste storage and hydrocarbon developments.Salt diapirs have no porosity or permeability and create a wide range of subtle traps such as stratigraphic and unconformity types. The traps are especially significant for petroleum exploration in highly mature areas where many of the fields around diapirs are economically marginal. Diapirs come in a wide variety of shapes and sizes due to the diversity of salt mechanics, which embodies different means of movement initiation, growth dynamics and the eventual termination of growth [1]. The diverse and complex shapes of diapirs mean that these shapes are often difficult to describe.Knowledge of the local in-situ stress state around a salt diapir is important if the region is to be developed as a petroleum province. The contemporary stress state has widespread influence on engineering a petroleum reservoir, as outlined by [2], which include the following: implications for wellbore stability and quality; implications for the orientation of induced hydraulic fractures and enhanced oil operations; implications for the orientation of open, natural fractures; implications for fault-trap integrity. Figure 1 shows an example of stress related wellbore problems associated with salt diapirism and faulting in the Mungo petroleum field, Central North Sea, UK [3].

AB  - ABSTRACTIt is of significant importance for longshore current instability to nearshore hydrodynamic and sediment transport. To further study the mechanism of longshore current instability, this paper obtains different instability growth modes and its reasons caused by the different velocity profile characteristics of slope 1 : 100 and 1 : 40 based on the experimental study of longshore current instability by using the linear shear instability model. The results show that: (1) The instability of longshore current only exists backshear mode for slope 1 : 40 and may exist frontshear and backshear modes for slope 1 : 100. (2) The peaks of linear instability growth mode for slope 1 : 100 correspond to three cases, the dominant peak is formed by the joint action of frontshear and backshear or by backshear alone. The results of oscillation period, wavelength and spatial variation obtained by analysis of linear shear instability are agreed with the experimental results.INTRODUCTIONThe wave tranmits obliquely toward the coast and produces current along the coast, that is, longshore current. It involves the mechanical problems which cannot be completely resolved today such as wave breaking, wave boundary layer and turbulence, and strong nonlinear fluid motion. The movement law is complex, and it is also one of the main dynamic factors of coastal pollutant movement, sediment transport and coastal deformation(Burchard et al.,2008;Wang and Zou,2015;Chen,2005). Fleming and Swart(1982) indicated that 10% of the longshore current forecast errors may lead to 70% longshore sediment transport errors. For the study of waved-driven currents, Longuet-Higgins and Stewart (1964) proposed the concept of radiation stressand stated that longshore current is mainly caused by the radiation stress and the uneven distribution of wave setup induced by the uneven distribution of wave height. With the deepening of the understanding of longshore current, Oltman-Shay et al. (1989) found that the longshore current velocity vector exists left and right swing, which is proved to be an unstable movement finally. Miles et al. (2002) pointed out that sediment transport in the vertical direction of 16% and along the coast of 12% are caused by the instability of longshore current. The study of Sanchez et al. (2003)showed that instability along the coast plays a major role in the formation of coastal rhythmic terrain. All of these indicated that the instability of longshore current has an important effect on sediment transport and shoreline evolution.Since the unsteady movement of longshore currents observed by Oltman-Shay et al. (1989), many studies have been made on its characteristics.

AB  - Abstract Numerical simulators have been extensively used in reservoir engineering for several decades. These simulators, based on energy, material, and momentum (multiphase Darcy law) balances and thermodynamic equilibrium of components between phases, solve a coupled set of nonlinear partial differential equations. We have observed multiple states for simulation of Steam-Assisted Gravity Drainage (SAGD) with multiple steam-to-oil ratios resulting at the same steam injection rate. The existence of multiple solutions and potentially limit cycle behavior and its associated bifurcation branching in the operation parameter space inspires us to consider a dynamical approach to reservoir simulation. There are four dominant states of stability: absolutely stable; neutrally stable; unstable subject to infinitesimal perturbation; and unstable subject to finite amplitude perturbation. In essence, instability is a process that releases potential energy stored in the base state to the perturbation state. In a reservoir simulation, if we impose a perturbation with a certain magnitude to a quasi-steady state, linear stability theory predicts that once the system becomes unstable, the magnitude of the perturbation grows with time infinitely. However, in reality, due to nonlinearity the system causes it to evolve to a new quasi-steady state. The questions that we are going to address in this paper are: How can we use a transient reservoir simulator to detect instability of the system that may lead to different and multiple operating states? As a case study, we will use a 2D homogeneous SAGD model. Once the model reaches a quasi-steady state, we will call it our base state. Then we impose different steam injection rate perturbations on the system and see how the system responds to these changes. Different behaviors result –for finite amplitude perturbations, the state evolves to a new state (Hopf bifurcation) (Strogatz 2014). Our goal is to use an existing commercial simulator to construct multiple operating states and describe an approach to detect them. Multiple operating states could have significant implications for process control and risk/uncertainty management of reservoir operations.
