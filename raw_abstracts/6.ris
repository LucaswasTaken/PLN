AB  - Abstract Converting data to actionable information through continuous oil production monitoring is a fundamental part of any production optimization strategy. The development of Intelligent Field technology has remarkably contributed to the upgrading of production surveillance framework and provided an extended access to real-time data. This same technology is still in its infancy when it comes to multiphase mass metering and field practicality issues. As for conventional fields where the unavailability of continuous data flow is not considered out of norm, the high uncertainty in oil production rate estimation and allocation is very well expected. The main source of this uncertainty is the reliance on sporadic welltest data and empirical multiphase flow correlations to allocate liquid production rate. Critical and subcritical multiphase flow choke performance is predicted using well-known correlations that are based on specific datasets characterized by a specific field or hydrocarbon type. Case studies where those correlations are matched with different production data and used later to predict the choke performance are present in the literature. Yet, the oil industry is faced with many challenges because of the limited accuracy of those predictions. The complexity of multiphase flow behavior and the irregularities in operational conditions can explain such low capability of those correlations particularly on field data. Artificial intelligence (AI) tools and techniques for so-called artificial neural networks, fuzzy logic and functional networks were employed to develop data-driven oil flow rate computational models for both critical and subcritical flow conditions. These AI models were trained and tested exploiting 595 production rate tests from 31 different wells. The prediction results showed a strong correlation with actual field data and promised a reliable tool/methodology to estimate oil flow rate as a function of operational conditions and choke size. This paper presents an engineering look at the inclusion of AI data-driven models in the production surveillance system to enhance welltest data validation and reduce the uncertainties in production allocation.

AB  - Abstract Harsh weather conditions result in severe heave motion on floating drilling rigs. The drill string is heave-compensated during drilling ahead, however, when slips are set during drill pipe connections, the topside heave compensation system is disabled, and the drill string is then moving up and down together with the rig. Pressure oscillations below and around the drill bit, induced by such movement, are known as "surge & swab". These oscillations can be in the order of 20 bar or more during drill pipe connections in the North Sea and pose a serious challenge to drilling of wells with narrow pressure margins from floating rigs in harsh weather environment. A managed pressure drilling (MPD) choke at the surface cannot be used to control rig heave-induced surge & swab due to the fast nature of the pressure oscillations in question, stochastic character of the sea waves that cause them and long time-delay between topside choking and bottomhole response. Continuous Circulation System (CCS) might be able to reduce the pressure oscillations somewhat by maintaining constant mud flow during connections. Computer simulations and laboratory experiments were previously used to investigate a novel method for attenuating surge & swab by utilizing an autonomous choke to be installed in the bottom-hole assembly (BHA). The bottomhole pressure oscillations can be effectively reduced through dynamic in-situ control of the mud flow through BHA by a downhole choke. This paper presents the downhole choke system and the results from the first pilot trial conducted in a mud flow loop at Ullrigg test rig in Stavanger utilizing a full-scale version of the choke. The prototype was subjected to drilling mud with flow rates up to 2500 lpm and differential pressure up to 250 bar to investigate its ability to accurately control the flow while at the same time withstanding the demanding conditions. Satisfactory choke valve characteristics were obtained, indicating ability to control the flow with sufficient precision. Flow testing resulted in severe erosion of carbon steel components while wolfram carbide components were able to withstand the erosive nature of the flow. The test also uncovered challenges related to operation of the choke with high differential pressure and flow rates which could later be related to the motor, used to control the downhole choke assembly. The next phase of the project is to design a downhole prototype and test it in an onshore test well to achieve Technology Readyness Level (TRL) 4 qualification ("ready for first use offshore"). The final goal is to qualify the downhole choke together with MPD and a Continuous Circulation System (CCS) for use on floating drilling rigs in harsh weather environment.

AB  - AbstractSand production in gas reservoirs is often associated with severe erosion of topside installations, due to high velocity impact of sand grains on tubing bends and choke restrictions. Dedicated laboratory testing on various field and outcrop sandstone specimens surprisingly show that sand production onset is delayed relative to oil or brine flow through the same rocks. This delay is observed even when care is taken to match the drag force on the sand grains to that observed in tests with liquid flow. One proposed explanation is that desiccation of the sandstone occurs, due to the expansion of the gas as it emerges into the borehole; drying of many sandstones is accompanied with an increase in strength, which may be responsible for the observed sand onset delay. Another hypothesis is that non-linear gas flow in the porous rock results in losses due to acceleration and deceleration from pore to pore, such that only part of the flow energy is translated into drag force on the grains. Careful analysis of the laboratory tests seems to confirm the latter hypothesis. 1. INTRODUCTIONGas reservoirs are often produced with high rates in wells and topside pipes [1]. For weak sandstone formations, this entails the risk that any sand particles co-produced with the gas also have high velocities. Such high velocity sand grains cause extensive erosion damage, especially in bends and when passing through choke restrictions [2]. This erosion propensity explains the widespread practice in the oil and gas industry of restricting gas production rates so as to avoid any risk of sand production. On the other hand, accurate prediction of the conditions for sand onset, in terms of allowable drawdown to the wells and depletion of in-situ pressure in the reservoir, is vital in order to preserve the economic interests, i.e. maximizing fluid productivity. Even if no sand management approach is adopted [3], a closer investigation of sand rate evolution after sand onset is still needed, so as to better quantify the needed safety factor when designing well production throughout expected operation lifetime.

AB  - AbstractDeepwater well control with a subsea BOP is often difficult and in many circumstances impossible with the usual methods and procedures. This is not only due to the narrow margin between pore and formation fracture pressures, but also to friction losses in kill and choke lines. Such a situation is aggravated by the sharp rheology increase experienced with synthetic or oil base mud that is caused by the low temperatures deep sea. In some field cases, the gelling effect of mud at low temperature even preclude to start circulating out the kick without exceeding the formation fracture pressure. By injecting base oil or primary emulsion at BOP level, mud hydrostatic, rheology and gelling effect can be significantly lowered. These enable one to compensate for friction losses and to circulate out the kick at a higher flow rate. Kick control through kill and choke lines may be attempted when it is impossible with usual procedures. Computed simulations of this new kick control method applied to some real field cases demonstrate benefits of the method. The decrease of the mud rheology due to the mixture with base oil or primary emulsion is quantified by rheological measurements.IntroductionSince 94 Total Fina Elf has drilled more than 30 deep water wells ranging from 1000 to 2165 meters water depth, most of them being located West Africa, Gulf of Guinea area. Total Fina Elf spent great deal of time and resource studying deep-water well control. To cope with the narrow operating window a new well control tool called advanced driller's method[1] has even been designed in addition with people trained to use it. Some gas kicks where experienced and in all cases despite of a quick and sound reaction of the crew, establishing circulation through kill and choke lines without encountering partial or total mud losses was found impossible. Causes of deep-water well control problems are well documented: Narrow margin between the formation fracture pressure and the pore pressure. Kick detection difficulties due to large mud circulating volume and to the floating rig motion. Larger influx due to kick detection difficulties and BOP closing time. Strong gelling effect and high rheological properties induced by low temperature (around 4¬∞C). High friction losses due to high rheology, small diameter and choke line length.This paper will review deep water drilling conditions in West Africa and propose a method and procedure to mitigate the impact of the high mud rheology and high friction losses inside choke line during well control.West Africa deep water drillingMost Gulf of Guinea wildcats and development wells are normally pressurized (hydrostatic) with very shallow objectives ranging from 600 to 2000 meters below the mud line. The total drilled meterage is generally lesser than the water depth. This increases the difficulty of a successful kick control due to the narrowness of the mud weight window. No shallow hazard such as shallow water flow, shallow gas or hydrates layers have been encountered yet. The meteorological and oceanic conditions are benign. Most of the wells are drilled with Oil Base Mud (OBM). Typical wildcat casing program are quite classical: a 36" or 30" CP is jetted to 65 - 70 meters below the mud line, a 20" casing set at 500 - 600 meters, a 13-3/8" at 700 - 900 meters, and a 10-¬æ"√ó9-5/8" at 1000 - 1400 meters. Leak Off Tests (LOT) are very poor, averaging 1.1 - 1.13 at 20" shoe, 1.15 - 1.2 at 13-3/8" shoe, 1.25 - 1.3 at 9-5/8" shoe. Water depths are ranging from 800 to 2000m, but will be extended to 3000 meters in a near future.

AB  - Abstract Saudi Aramco's rapidly growing portfolio of fields and wells demands the employment of innovative approaches to manage its assets efficiently in today's challenging economy. One of the main strategies that the company has adopted is the creation of a highly interactive surveillance environment called Production Operations Surveillance Hub (POSH), that supports business collaboration and efficient decision making processes. POSH enables the business to exceed geography and time by consolidating multidisciplinary team knowledge, streamlining communication, providing real-time collaboration and facilitating quick decision making. The POSH also provides an e-workplace for oil and gas production automation and optimization that allows business team members and their partners (within and outside the company) to communicate and coordinate activities from anywhere in real time. The creation of this environment started with a comprehensive assessment of the production engineering (PE) activities and processes. The assessment was conducted through electronic surveys, face-to-face interviews and interactive workshops to gather the required information from PE experts and develop a full understanding of their work processes. These "as is" processes were then transformed into "to be" workflows where technology applications were associated with each step of the process. A detailed design phase followed, which involved defining the engineering calculations, the communication protocol and the data exchange pathways among the different components of each workflow and between the workflows. A cataloging and organization phase followed in which four main themes were identified for the POSH and aligned with Saudi Aramco's intelligent fields' development strategy. The four focus areas include: well and field activities management; intelligent field equipment performance and real-time data health; electric submersible pumps (ESP) surveillance and pre-diagnostic; and well production and performance monitoring. This paper describes the assessment planning and implementation process. The paper also illustrates the value of this process through elaboration on the assessment outcome and provision of details of the POSH themes and functions. This step is essential for the success of the deployment of Saudi Aramco's first POSH and similar collaborative environments.

AB  - Water shutoff treatments need different approach and chemicals in gas and¬†oil fields due to the inverse mobility ratio. Therefore, the primary aim of the¬†research project was to develop special treating solution, which may form barrier¬†phase against the flow of water by in-situ mixing of the treating fluid with¬†formation water. As a novelty, water sensitive petroleum-based solutions were¬†developed, which are stable until they are contacted with water. The induced¬†phase inversion of such metastable systems restricts the water flow by¬†80-90% in sandstone cores through evolving¬†extremely high viscosity in the mixing zones. Optimizing the composition¬†of the treating fluid containing environmentally friendly chemicals the method was qualified as matured for field pilot tests.¬†Evaluating the production history of possible alternatives, two gas¬†producing wells were selected for the pilot. The wells are operating in¬†different layers of the largest, stacked Hungarian oil and gas field. Prior to¬†treatment, in both cases, the gas rate dropped significantly; meanwhile the¬†water production rapidly increased to 120 and 150 BPD, respectively. The¬†injection protocol started with partial reduction of water saturation in the\¬†nearby zone of wells by injection of water-miscible organic solvent driven¬†deeply into the reservoir with N2. Afterwards, the petroleum bulk¬†solution containing tenside and fatty acid ester in appropriate concentration¬†was injected. Injecting 40-50 m3 treating solution, nitrogen drive¬†served again to reach deep penetration of treating solution. Monitoring the¬†wellhead pressure it was clearly indicated when the induced phase inversion¬†started to build-up resistance against the water flow. Applying short shut-in¬†time, transient production period was observed, which was followed by gradually¬†increasing gas production with water-free and reduced water influx. The¬†preliminary data firmly proved that the unique water shutoff technology might¬†open new vistas reservoir conformance control in gas fields.

While not published, this paper has been included in the eLibrary with the permission of and transfer of copyright from the author. In all oil and gas fields the control and checking of the well producing capacity are a part of routine everyday operations. The purpose of the well producing capacity control is to establish such relations between well production rate and depression which do not harmfully affect the established reservoir's performance. The production capacity control in the flowing wells can be performed by: a/ installing surface or subsurface choke of a given size, b/ landing the tubing of a given size, c/ landing the packer or inverted funnel, d/ mounting the intermitter on the well head. Special care should be taken of surface choke selection. It must be of such a size that small pressure changes in pressure end /downstream/ do not cause harmful pressure changes in the tubing head /upstream/ and which, at the sane time, do not badly reflect on the well performance. To achieve this the flow through the choke rust be at the same velocities as that of sound, in other words, at critical flow conditions. For such velocities, the upstream and downstream ratio Po/PT - according to Poettman - trust not exceed C.55. According to Gilbert, Poettman - trust not exceed C.55. According to Gilbert, the pressure upstream the choke should be at least 70% higher than that downstream. Recalculating it into the Po/PT ratio, the value of 0.588 is obtained. After Po/PT ratio, the value of 0.588 is obtained. After fulfilling these conditions, the volumetric velocity of oil and gas mixture flowing through the choke of a given size depends on the tubing-head pressure and producing gas-oil ratio /GOR/. producing gas-oil ratio /GOR/.

AB  - Abstract Progressive Cavity Pumps (PCPs), if properly sized, can greatly improve a well's deliverability and run-life. As a result, PCP sizing for a large number of wells can be instrumental in a production optimization program. This paper presents a quick look methodology adopted in the Bhagyam field to better understand PCP system performance and to accurately predict pump deliverability under a wide range of downhole conditions for more than a hundred wells. Using nodal analysis, this paper presents the procedure used to select optimum pump size and well fluid rates from well inflow and outflow performance. The paper also presents a correction factor for the effect of viscosity on pump performance and uses the corrected pump performance curves to model the expected liquid rate from a well. The solutions obtained with the analyses have been validated against actual Bhagyam well test data and have proved to be fairly consistent. This procedure has not only been a useful tool for pump selection and performance monitoring but has also made a significant business impact in terms of incremental oil gain.The methodology quickly provides reasonably accurate solutions for pump selection and allows evaluation of real time pump parameters to optimize PCP under varying field conditions.

AB  - A multiphase flow equation describing the behavior of orifice flow may be used directly to evaluate well performance as a function of choke size; upstream choke pressure; choke temperature; producing and solution GOR; gas, oil, and water gravities; and a discharge coefficient. The coefficient compensates for nonideal factors excluded in the development of the equation and relates theoretical oil production rates through chokes to field-measured rates. Discussion Various developments have been published that present theory and correlations for describing simultaneous liquid and gas flow though a restrictive orifice. The correlations of Poettmann and Beck were intended to aid in the prediction of gas-liquid flow through chokes. Their development followed the original presentation by Ros and was derived for an average orifice discharge coefficient. Poettmann and Beck considered the polytropic expansion of the gaseous phase of the fluid expanding through the choke. The polytropic expansion theory was used successfully by Ros and is perhaps the most rigorous development in the application of orifice flow theory to oilfield conditions. Basically, the derivation of any orifice relationship is dependent on two main criteria. First, an expression must be written relating the flowing fluid specific volume and velocity to the mass flow rate. Second, an independent equation must be written incorporating the behavior of the gaseous phase of the fluid with pressure. The above stipulations are met by the following relationships. The energy balance around a fluid flowing through an orifice may be written as 144 = 0.........................(1) The polytropic expansion equation relating the specific volume of the gas, (Vf - Vl), to the confining pressure, p, the polytropic expansion constant, b, and the ratio p, the polytropic expansion constant, b, and the ratio of specific heat at constant pressure to specific heat at constant volume, n, is n p(Vf - Vl) = b...............................(2) When an expression for the orifice velocity, v2, is achieved with Eqs. 1 and 2, a relationship for the mass rate of flow through the choke is achieved by using the resulting relationship: v2 qm = CA ------...................................(3) vf2 where C is the orifice discharge coefficient, and Subscript 2 denotes downstream orifice throat conditions. The solution of Eqs. 1 through 3 is given in Appendix A. The results are summarized below. For critical orifice flow, the critical pressure ratio, Ec, defined as the ratio of the upstream pressure to the downstream choke pressure, occurs when = ------- = 0; = critical pressure ratio.

AB  - Abstract Prior to a planned transition in producing zones, an 18,000‚Ä≤ single well subsea tieback flowline to a deepwater Gulf of Mexico production facility experienced a restricted flowline ID and partial blockages due to paraffin deposition. Efforts were coordinated to provide support in the design, product selection, and determination of success for the flowline remediation. Transient multiphase flow simulations were created and tuned/validated with historical slugging data to estimate initial effective ID of the subsea flowline. The models were then applied to the planned clean-out procedure to develop performance indicators during and after flushing operations. A two-step remediation consisting of a 24 hour hydrocarbon solvent/dispersant mixture soak, followed by a 4,000 bbl seawater and waterbased paraffin dispersant flush at increasing rates utilizing solvency, dispersancy, and shear was used to remove deposition and increase cross-sectional flow area of the pipeline by 85% (initial effective ID ~2.5 in., final effective ID ~3.4 in.). The procedures were created to minimize risk of packing solids following initial disaggregation, while maximizing effectiveness of the flowline clean-out within the economic constraints of a depressed oil market.

AB  - AbstractBritish Petroleum issued a challenge, in 1993, to its European producing assets, to increase production by 15% while keeping within its agreed capital budget. To compliment new production attention was also focused on increased production efficiency. The resultant production efficiency campaign, based on simple premises. has contributed a 4% real increase in the operations efficiency in BP's North Sea portfolio, without a substantial increase in opex or capex, resulting in a net gain to BP of some 10 mmboe over the last two years.IntroductionThe North Sea has become a mature province even as its production level continues to rise. British Petroleum recognized the aging nature of its portfolio and issued a challenge to its producing assets, in 1993, to increase production by 15% while keeping within its capital and opex forecast. To compliment the work that was focusing on increasing Production Potential, (more reserves, more wells and more production capacity) attention was also focused on Production Efficiency. The production efficiency campaign was coincident with a reorganization into distinct asset teams, which placed a premium both on safe production delivery within, and communication between assets. To benefit the challenge a common language for defining production losses was adopted and modified to be generic enough for all assets to use. The resultant "choke model" has become the tool that has allowed alignment of problem identification and actions, both intra asset and between like assets. Within two years of adopting the model the assets have been able to show marked and near continuous improvement in both their production efficiency and the delivery of hydrocarbons to market.Statement of Theory and DefinItionsProduction Efficiency improvement is built around the simple concept of a pipeline through which the oil flows from reservoir to market. The objective is maintaining the daily flow rate at the maximum possible. This throughput may be plant capacity for plateau producers or the total well potential for mature phase fields. See Figure 1 Generic Choke Model Concept. A series of restrictions or chokes are visualized in this pipeline, that represent the areas of production loss, i.e. Reservoir potential, as measured by well tests, that is not delivered. The resultant losses are those that occur due to: Reservoir Management; Well Availability and Utilization; Topsides Availability and Utilization, (i.e. the efficiency of using the available equipment); and Export system. (A more specific calculation procedure for the chokes, as given to the assets in 1993, is detailed in the appendix.) These are simplified for management reporting as Reservoir, Wells, Plant, and Export chokes. At this level of detail these "chokes" are common to all our assets.The choke model exists on lower levels as seen in Table 2, Expanded Choke Model Example. Items that appear as in parentheses in the table are specific only to the gas business where the concept of loss must be redefined to allow for system substitution, where available. Thus a gas asset suffers only a true loss when it has missed a DCQ target and has not been able to make up its temporary shortfall. In most instances a pure gas asset carries both a sales efficiency, near 100%, and a system or platform efficiency that more accurately describes the state of the operations. Assets that are both significant oil and gas producers, e.g. Bruce, carry two sets of efficiencies, one as a gas producer and one as an oil producer.The chokes may become more numerous depending on the reservoir processes employed by the asset. This is illustrated in Table 1 as one reads down the figure. In a field such as Magnus or Ula the Gross Potential is very dependent on water injection capacity, and a separate choke model can be used to model injection performance on the wells and reservoir potential. Some assets will carry analysis to the six minor chokes shown and all will further analyze down to at least another level e.g. ESP failure, metering. The assets modify/use the lower parts of the model they see as valid for their particular circumstances.P. 299

AB  - Abstract The unconventional reservoir engineer is required to evaluate increasingly complex data. In additional to the rapid advancement of technology used to complete and stimulate unconventional resources, there has been a proliferation of type curve procedures (i.e. pressure and rate transient analysis), decline techniques, and reservoir modelling strategies in the literature. Specific challenges are the analysis of single and multi-phase flow form hydraulically stimulated horizontal and multi-lateral wells. Although state of the art simulation techniques can be used to model any complex reservoir and well architecture, restrictions on data quality, project schedules, and budgets do not always allow for detailed simulation and analysis. Furthermore, initialization of the numerical model often requires some form of analytical modelling as a precursor to the larger model. However, complex scenarios production analysis or forecasting of horizontal wells, dual and tri-laterals, fracture horizontals as well heterogeneous reservoirs can be simplified by using an proxy model which is accurate (if not exact) with respect to long-term deliverability and resource/reserve estimation. Complex wells and reservoirs can be modelled and analyzed by using a simple homogenous reservoir with effective permeability, skin, and wellbore radius combinations. Examples will demonstrate this procedure would allow for the use of simple analytical software tools in lieu of simulation, or the generation of reliable forecasts in the absence of completion/reservoir data

AB  - AbstractUncertainty has become an ever important subject for the oil industry as the engineer learns to use the skills of the mathematician. The use of distributions rather than single numbers, and uncertainty analysis has permeated through many common areas of the work of the oil industry.Such methods have, for a number of years, been applied to estimate the range of reserves for discoveries. when applied to production forecasting, together with other techniques, improvements can be achieved both in the forecasts and in the understanding of the restrictions that are being placed on production. This, in turn, can lead to improved levels of production.P. 339

AB  - Summary The critical and subcritical multiphase flow through wellhead restrictions of a prolific oil field in the Middle East is investigated, and two sets of new correlations are presented. The first set of correlations is developed by using 40 field tests representing critical flow conditions. The second set of correlations is based on 139 field tests representing subcritical flow conditions of gas/liquid mixtures through wellhead chokes. For the critical multiphase flow condition, the predicted oil flow rates by the new set of correlations are in excellent agreement with the measured ones. The absolute average percent difference (AAPD) is between 1.88 and 4.37, and the corresponding standard of deviation (SD) is between 2.52 and 6.52. These results are found to be statistically superior to those predicted by other published correlations considered in this work. During the subcritical gas/liquid flow conditions through surface chokes, the accuracy of oil flow rates predicted by the new set of correlations seems to be sensitive to the type and size of the choke being used. For Cameron LD type and 144/64-in. choke, the oil flow rates predicted by the proposed correlation are superior to those predicted by other methods available in the literature, with AAPD of 8.5. However, for smaller choke sizes of 96/64 and 64/64 in., the oil flow rates predicted by the new correlations and other methods are found to be close to each other. For Cameron F type and 144/64-in. choke size, the oil flow rates predicted by the new correlation are closely matched by those predicted by other published methods, with AAPD of 13.7. For smaller choke sizes of 80/64 and 64/64 in., few field tests are available, and the predications of all methods, including the proposed ones, show similar statistical results. The above findings for Cameron F choke also seem to apply to beaned wellhead assemblies for this particular oil field.

AB  - Abstract The objective of this study is to develop and validate a theoretical slip model for two-phase flow through chokes. As opposed to the models1,2 currently used by the industry, the present model accounts for slippage between the liquid and gas phases as they pass through the choke. The theoretical basis of the model is a 1D balance equation of mass, momentum and energy with the assumptions of constant quality and incompressible liquid phase. The present slip model is capable of predicting the critical/sub-critical flow boundary and the critical and sub-critical mass flow rates. A model validation study demonstrated the capability of the slip models to predict the critical flow boundary with an average error and standard deviation of 5.2% and 15.5% respectively. Furthermore, the present slip model predicted the sub-critical mass flow rate with an average error and standard deviation of 2.7% and 12.5%, respectively. Compared to existing no-slip models1,2 commonly used by the industry, the present slip model predictions outperformed their predictions, indicating the importance of the slippage phenomenon. Introduction The two common restrictions encountered in a production system are surface chokes and subsurface safety valves (SSSV). The purposes of installing chokes and SSSV's are different; however, the basic equations which govern the flow through these restrictions are very similar. There are two types of flow behavior across chokes, namely, critical and sub-critical. The critical flow occurs when the fluid velocity at the smallest cross section in the restriction is equal to the velocity of sound in that medium. When the velocity is less than the velocity of sound, we call it a sub-critical flow; if the velocity is greater than the velocity of sound, we call it a critical flow. If the flow is sub-critical, the flow rate is related to the pressure drop across the restriction. On the other hand, if the flow is critical, the rate is only related to the upstream pressure, thus reduction in down stream pressure does not affect the rate since the reduction can never be transmitted upstream. Predicting the flow pattern, critical/sub-critical boundary, as well as the flow rate across the choke is crucial for well productivity and optimization. Extensive studies were conducted and several models were developed on two-phase flow across chokes which mainly fall into two categories, namely empirical and theoretical models. The empirical models such as Gilbert3, Ros4, Achong5, Pilehvari6, Ashford and Pierce7, Osman and Dokla8, and Omana et al.9 were all developed on specific range of data and can not be extended beyond their range. The second category comprises the theoretical approaches, basically derived from mass, momentum and energy balances such as Sachdeva et al.1, Perkins2 and Selmer-Olsen et al.9 The theoretical models are mostly used by the industry because of their ability to simulate the physical phenomena, thus they are considered more accurate. The following is a brief description of these theoretical models. Sachdeva et al.1 acquired experimental data for critical, sub-critical flows and the boundary between them using air/water and air/kerosene system for different sizes of choke diameters ranging from 0.25 to 0.5 in. A theoretical model is developed from the 1D mass, momentum and energy balance equations for a two-phase gas liquid mixture to predict the critical and sub-critical mass fluxes, which is considered comprehensive since fluid properties are also involved. Perkins2 presented theoretical equations that describe isentropic multiphase flow across a choke valid for critical sub-critical flows. The model incorporates the oil, gas and water properties correlations to predict the critical/sub-critical boundary. An expression for total mass flow rate across the choke was developed through a combined equation of conservation of mass and isentropic expansion of a homogeneous multiphase mixture. Selmer-Olsen et al.10 acquired experimental data and developed the "Hydro?? model which uses a control volume approach for the choke orifice and its downstream to mechanistically account for irreversible loss process instead of using discharge coefficient only. The model is derived from the local cross-sectional averaged balance equations of mass, momentum and energy for steady-state flow of a multiphase mixture. Contrary to Sachdeva et al.1 and Perkins2 models, the "Hydro?? model accounts for slippage between the phases. Although the "Hydro?? model is more accurate, it is complex in formulation and solution for the boundary.

AB  - AbstractSachdeva's multiphase choke flow model has capabilities of predicting critical-subcritical boundary and liquid and gas flow rates for given upstream and downstream pressures. Although this model was shown to be accurate by Sachdeva et al. in their original paper using laboratory and field data, inaccuracy of the model has been found in other field applications. It is highly desirable for production engineers to find the applicability of this model when it is applied to gas condensate wells. In this study, the accuracy of the Sachdeva's choke model was evaluated using data from oil and gas condensate wells in Southwest Louisiana. Comparisons of the results from the model and field measurements indicate that Sachdeva's choke model generally under-estimates gas and condensate flow rates. Based on measurements from 239 gas condensate wells it was found that the model under-estimates gas rate and liquid rate by as much as 40% and 60%, respectively. The model also failed to calculate mass flow rates for 48 condensate wells where relatively low-pressure differentials at chokes and high-flow rates were observed.The investigation further went on to improve the performance of Sachdeva's choke model. It was found that the error of the model could be minimized using different values of choke discharge coefficient (CD). For gas condensate wells, the error in gas flow rate calculations can be minimized using CD = 1.073. However, the error in liquid flow rate calculations for condensate wells is minimum when CD = 1.532.Introduction Computer technology has been widely used for simulation of petroleum production network today. The production network consists of reservoirs, wellbore equipment, and surface equipment including chokes, flow lines, production manifolds, and distilation facilities such as separators. The production network simulation has gained strong momentum due to fast advances in computing technology in the past five years. Wellhead chokes are special equipment used in energy industry to control fluid production rates from wells, to maintain stable pressure downstream from the choke, and to provide the necessary backpressure to a reservoir to avoid formation damage from excessive drawdown. Because oil and gas production rates are extremely sensitive to choke size, accurate modelling of choke performance is vitally important for petroleum engineers in oil production simulation.

AB  - Abstract Riphean anisotropic cavernous-fissured carbonate reservoirs of oilfield at East Siberia area ‚Äì one of the most problematic objects of oil and gas production described in this article. Here is discussed geological substantiation and first result of new technology involving in drilling of Riphean carbonate reservoirs with "Controlled pressure technology" by recovery wells with horizontal bottom at the oil-gas condensate field in Evenki Region. Comparison results of conventional drilling and "MPD" (Managed Pressure Drilling) technology. Riphean reservoirs drilling process could be provided in two options. The first one ‚Äì horizontal conventional drilling. As far as the bit penetrates into the reservoir we are seeing SPP (Stand Pipe Pressure) decrease which means we have total lost circulation. There was only one means for resolving this problem ‚Äì using LCM (Lost Circulation Material). Due to complicated geology and high parameter of gas factor in Riphean reservoirs (losses while circulation/ gains while static), LCM was insufficient solution. The second is to perform drilling process using MPD (Managed Pressure Drilling) technology. We have the advantage using lower mud weight compared with conventional drilling. MPD technology corresponds with geological conditions of Riphean reservoirs and can be more profitable in future production from these wells. MPD technology with closed loop circulation system showed that we can "manage" BHP (Bottom Hole Pressure) and it really works in temperature conditions of 45 Celsius below zero in Evenki Region (East Siberia). In practice we have seen, that it was possible to achieve more gentle management of BHP than with conventional drilling using LCM. Also with "MPD" system in this oilfield we were able to drill the first ERD (Extended Reach Drilling) well. However, even with such extended horizontal section (1000 meters), a significant reduction of losses was achieved without using LCM. Total results of MPD technology we will see after DST (Drill Stem Test) of drilled wells. New technology showed that it was a right choice to use close loop system and MPD. Also for drilling new wells in this Riphean carbonate reservoirs of this oilfield area we will use this experience. Best way to reduce catastrophic losses in abnormally low pressure reservoir conditions is reduce and control the ECD and details how to achieve it we have considered in this article. The results: Reduced interval construction time. From 31 days to 24 days. Reduced fluid loss during drilling. From 2000 m3 to 1200 m3. Improved the operational safety by closing the loop and real time early kick and loss detection.

AB  - Abstract An effective and comprehensive integrated production-system monitoring framework plays an important role in the Smart Fields philosophy to turn data into actionable information and therefore value. This has been demonstrated by implementing some of the principal requirements for such a framework in the application called Data Broker in Shell. The Data Broker infrastructure has allowed Shell Engineers to perform exception-based surveillance. Used together with other Smart Fields applications such as FieldWare Production Universe, FieldWare Well Test, IPM and Energy Components, automated event recognition and workflows has freed up engineer's time to do more value added work, such as technical analysis and decision-making - time that would otherwise be spent looking for and validating data from many different sources. The system allows for a more efficient handling of data in terms of efficiency, quality and timeliness in reporting to end-users. The advent of real-time algorithms, monitoring tools, better integration software, event and workflow application tools allows the above infrastructure to be realised. Introduction There is a drive in the industry towards more advanced ways of managing hydrocarbon fields and many companies have initiated programs to implement new innovative ways of working [1]. These programs have been called various names: in Shell the program is called Smart Fields. These programs typically involve extending access to, and improving the quality of, production and metering data in the field so operators and engineers are aware of what the field is doing in real time. As fields are getting equipped with more and more gauges, large volumes of data have become available, both in the process control domain, and in the office domain. The industry is faced with the challenge to turn this data into value. The prize contained with the data is reduced deferment, optimised production, accurate reservoir characterisation and better security of supply. If this concept is combined with a right degree of automation it also has the potential to increase the efficiency of staff as they can focus on the real problem areas rather that spending a lot of time trying to analyse the data and identify the problems. The term that has been coined for the latter is "exception based surveillance??. Exception based surveillance focuses on the exceptions that require a response from engineering staff. This means staff can spend their time working on real problems, and do not have to spend a lot of time looking for them. Surveys have shown that Engineers spend as much as 60% of their time to gather, QC, format, and convert data. At the heart of the Smart Fields concept are value loops (see Figure 1), which can be limited in scope and have short cycle times (such as control loops in a Process Control system) or cover a large scope and have a long cycle time (such as asset optimisation). In any case the loop needs to be closed, i.e. conclusion needs to be derived from information and action needs to be taken to improve the overall asset performance. If the loop is not closed, then there is a lot of wasted effort and investments are not capitalized on. For example, if you have invested in measuring down hole pressure, but data are not analyzed continuously and events (such as shut-ins) are not detected by staff in a timely fashion, then a lot of deferment can ensue. The loop from measured data to integrated modelling, event detection and follow up actions was not closed in that case. Deferment could have been reduced by a timely response on the basis of the data, and the gauge could have returned the value of purchase, installations and maintenance many times over. This paper first describes principal requirements for a comprehensive monitoring framework. In Shell an application called Data Broker has been developed that has implemented several of these principal requirements. In the description and application section, some of the implementation details of Data Broker are used to illustrate how one can realise a comprehensive monitoring framework. Practical examples are shown in the "Examples?? section.

AB  - AbstractThe domestic petroleum producing industry in Canada and the United States isfaced with serious foreign competition due to a high differential in producingcosts. The crude oil transportation factor and government restrictions provideeffective barriers behind which much of this country's crude is marketed. Inorder to become more competitive, many United States oil companies haveintroduced Operations Research into their domestic planning.The purpose of this paper is to point out briefly where Operations Researchhas been used in the petroleum industry, with more specific application beinggiven to producing operations. Some background thinking on the unique problemsof petroleum production is presented. An example using linear programming,taken from the literature, deals with a multi-reservoir field producingoperation.It is concluded that favourable results can be obtained by using OperationsResearch techniques to either maximize profits or income or to minimizeoperating and lifting costs in petroleum production operations.IntroductionEnergy is one of the most basic building blocks of any industrializedeconomy. The forms of energy most commonly used in North America are crude oil,bituminous coal, natural gas and electricity. As the natural sources of theseenergies are commonly found at a considerable distance from their end use, thetransportation cost will be an important factor in total energy costs.The international character of crude oil movements and the changes inpatterns that can take place from time to time are indicated by excess supplybreaking through in some areas to cause price deterioration. Despite this, thebasic fact remains that the United States and Canada are still largely suppliedby domestic oil and that, despite very much higher production costs, thetransportation factor and government restrictions provide an effective barrierbehind which much of the crude is marketed.

AB  - Abstract Murphy Montney has been implementing downhole chokes in a variety of successful applications that have resulted in both significantly improved well performance and facility equipment/chemical cost savings.¬† The specific applications piloted have included: Rate Restriction Mitigating Sand Plugging Surface Hydrate Elimination Liquid Unloading The observed reservoir performance improvement and mitigation of downhole sand plugging is the result of minimizing the net pressure condition created within the induced fracture network.¬† Restricted well drawdown minimizes the physical loss of the induced stimulation, loss which leads to the downhole plugging situation.¬†¬† In addition, Montney pressure dependent reservoir responses have demonstrated stimulated reservoir volume (SRV) flow capacity and fracture conductivity improvement/maintenance under higher flowing sandface pressure conditions, significantly enhancing the minimum-contacted-gas-in-place (CGIPmin).¬† A conceptual reservoir model whereby early pressure maintenance and long-term pressure management is required to maximize the EUR and long-term production has been developed. Downhole chokes are being used in lieu of surface line heaters and methanol injection in the mitigation of surface hydrate formation.¬† By moving the point of pressure and temperature reduction downhole, the Joule-Thompson cooling response across the choke is geothermally regulated.¬† Success has also been observed in liquid unloading applications.¬† Downhole choking can create a choked flow rate Venturi effect, which by definition is based upon a critical upstream to downstream pressure ratio, a function of the gas specific heat relationship.¬† Choked flow accelerates gas to a sonic velocity across the flow restriction, imparting a sufficient velocity head upon an upstream fluid level to carry a water droplet to surface.¬† The acceleration of fluid droplets across the downhole choke is equivalent to an infinite lowering of the liquid loading rate, limited only by the maintenance of the choked flow condition created across the downhole choke. The downhole choke permits for a controlled and self-regulated drawdown, creating both improved reservoir performance and well operations.¬† Mitigating surface hydrate formation and frac sand flowback has resulted in significant cost savings.¬† A novel application specific to over-pressured reservoirs is the use of downhole chokes in liquid unloading applications, maintaining high flowing sandface pressure conditions while unloading liquid. Introduction The downhole choke pilot program is a field specific evaluation based upon results obtained within both the Tupper and Tupper West fields (Tupper Fields), Figure 1.¬† The Tupper Fields are a Montney play located in the North Eastern corner of British Columbia.

AB  - UNSOLICITED AbstractIn this study. field data from a gas condensate reservoir located in the Middle East are used to develop some empiricial correlations that describe the behaviour of gas condensate flow through chokes. The data cover wide ranges of flow rates and choke sizes. Four forms of correlation are checked against data. One of the forms is to correlate choke upstream pressure with liquid production rate. gas liquid ratio and choke size. The second form is developed by using gas production rate instead of the liquid rate in the previous form. previous form. The other two forms are developed by using the pressure drop across the choke instead of upstream pressure. These correlations are presented in graphical forms. Five error parameters are used to check presented in graphical forms. Five error parameters are used to check accuracy of the different forms. Namely: root mean square error mean absolute error. simple mean error, mean percentage absolute error and mean percentage error. It was found that the correlation is most accurate when using pressure drop data instead of choke upstream pressure in the correlation. The importance of the developed correlations lies in the fact that correlations for gascondensate systems are not available. Also such correlations will help the production engineer to a great extent in selecting choke sizes to control production of gas-condensate wells and predicting the performance of flowing wells under different conditions. IntroductionThere are two surface conditions under which a flowing well is produced, either using a choke or no restrictions at all. The produced, either using a choke or no restrictions at all. The majority of flowing wells are produced against chokes. The main reasons of using chokes are to control flow rate and thus to produce reservoirs at the most efficient rate and to prevent water and/or gas coning and sand problems. in the critical-flow region, the mass flow rate becomes independent of pressure drop across the chokes. Therefore, chokes are also used to isolate the reservoir from pressure disturbances by surface production facilities. The problem pressure disturbances by surface production facilities. The problem of multiphase flow through chokes has not been satisfactorily solved for all cases. Most solutions are offered only for the case of critical flow. Surbey et al discussed the applications of multiple-orifice valve chokes in critical flow conditions. Wallis developed a correlation to predict the sonic velocity in a two-phase homogeneous system. A different correlation was developed by Fortunati under no-slip condition between different phases.

AB  - Abstract Choke and kill lines used on deep water drilling risers subjected to high pressure are traditionally made of heavy wall steel pipes. By introducing light weight composite choke and kill lines, the submerged weight can be reduced by 50%. Choke and kill lines for deep water and high pressure may contribute up to 50% of the total drilling riser weight. The current development is making 22.6 m (75 ft) long composite choke and kill lines with an internal diameter of 114.3 mm (4.5") and pressure rated to 1034 bar (15000 psi). The lines have a steel liner and steel end connections to make them compatible with standard steel lines. The steel liner is reinforced with carbon fibre/ epoxy structural composite. The lines are designed to meet all relevant load cases both from operation, handling and qualification according to requirements in API and DNV standards. A technology qualification plan has been developed after a threat assessment exercise according to DNV RP-A203. To close the gaps in the technology qualification plan a set of pipe tests (on full diameter pipe) was conducted satisfying the requirements in the relevant design documents, including burst, fatigue and creep tests. The technology qualification plan establish the degree of qualification required for the new technology and comprises all activities needed in order to provide the set of evidences needed to show that the component is fit for purpose, and shall demonstrate confidence that the manufactured C&K - lines meet all performance requirements and hence will function reliably for intended use. To demonstrate the ability to make full length slender components by filament winding, three full 22.6 m (75 ft) lengths of the choke and kill lines were manufactured and have been successfully factory acceptance tested at 1560 bar (22500psi), i.e. 1.5 times the maximum design pressure. One of the unknown factors identified in the threat assessment was potential handling damage. Based on the threat assessment it was decided to have a pilot installation of the technology at the desired technology readiness level. A drilling rig has been selected as the potential site for a pilot, and the pilot is closing all gaps in the technology qualification plan. Introduction Background Hydrocarbon prospects are localized in water depths beyond 3000 m. At present it is a technological challenge to find cost-efficient methods to develop these potential ultra-deep water oil reserves found. Typical ultra-deep water areas are Gulf of Mexico, offshore Brazil, West Africa, East Africa (Kenya, Tanzania, Mozambique), Indonesia and India. Even more challenging is the ultra-deep water areas with harsh environment; these are Canada East Coast, Atlantic Margin and Norwegian Sea. The subsalt (or presalt) reservoirs adds increased complexity of very deep wells (6000-7000 m below the sea bottom), with long casing strings that needs to be deployed in the wells. The casing string weights can also be a challenge to the hook load of the derrick system on the rig. A high pressure reservoir needs a heavier drilling fluid to balance the well pressure, which adds even more to the hook loads. The size of the drilling rig is dependent on the requirements from both drilling riser system and the casing string. For deep water high pressure applications, choke & kill lines contribute to about 50% of the total drilling riser weight. Lighter choke & kill lines may increase the safety level by enabling use of heavier mud during drilling operations in deep water high pressure reservoirs.

AB  - Abstract The paper will include an introduction of dissolvable plug and its development in oil & gas upstream business. Dissolvable plug is a customized tool, and it could be modified by controlling its chemical compound to adjust its dissolving rate. In addition, high clearance dissolvable plug is a plug solution with dissolvability originally brought out to overcome the downhole restriction challenge (ID of SSD), namely to pass the downhole restriction then to set in the original casing ID. A case study of its application in offshore squeeze cementing job will be analyzed in this paper, from the plug designing perspective to operational data recap to prove its benefits. Conventional plugs will leave the bottom of the plug body downhole after plugs slip losing integrity during the milling operation, and the remainder leaving downhole will choke the well production or even block the well, however, dissolvable plug remainders will dissolve itself downhole, which will not have an impact on the production.

AB  - SummaryThe success of a primary cement job is often measured according to effectivezonal isolation, achieving the designed top of cement, and avoidance ofremedial cementing. In the San Juan and Rio Arriba counties of New Mexico, manyMesa Verde and Dakota wells are air-drilled because the Mesa Verde formation issubnormally pressured and naturally fractured.This combination makes theMesa Verde easy to hydraulically fracture during normal drilling and cementingoperations.Therefore, meeting the primary-cement-job success criteria isparticularly challenging.Cementing of casing within an air-drilled wellbore allows the slurry to freefall.Cement free fall can cause severe surge pressures at the bottom ofthe hole, leading to hydraulic fracture initiation and loss of lift.Theuse of a downhole choke (DHC) can be employed to prevent these processes fromoccurring.Because mud filter cake does not exist in an air-drilled hole, the leadwater spacer and cement must wet the casing and wellbore rocksurfaces.Loss of the lead water spacer, in conjunction with cement waterloss, can produce dehydration of the cement column, leading to an increase incement viscosity and equivalent circulating density.Careful control ofcement-free water and fluid loss are required to prevent this fromoccurring.Furthermore, placing cement across targeted completionintervals that have low fracture gradients requires the use of ahigh-compressive-strength, low-density cement that is competent and capable ofmaintaining zonal isolation during the completion and production phases of wellconstruction.This paper will outline the evolution of the cementing practices used forthe Mesa Verde and Dakota wells drilled in the 29-6 Unit (T29N - R6W, NewMexico) from 1998 to 2002.It will illustrate how cementing changesenabled the primary cementing to be successfully completed in a single stageinstead of two, which has translated into cost savings for both the drillingand completion phases of a well. The impact of using a DHC for the pumping andplacement of these primary cement jobs will be illustrated and discussed.The function of the cement additives on slurry properties will also bediscussed as they pertain to these cement jobs.IntroductionThe Mesa Verde and Dakota formations of the San Juan and Rio Arriba countiesof New Mexico are two of the primary completion targets for this area of theSan Juan basin.Fig. 1 shows a 500-square-mile view of the "Four Corners"area of the U.S.A., with the San Juan and Rio Arriba counties identified.Fig. 2 is a stratigraphic column of the San Juan basin.It illustratesthe Dakota and Mesa Verde formations, along with other productiveformations.The Dakota group is composed of a series of Cretaceouslenticular sandstones and shales.The nomenclature and designation of theindividual layers vary and are beyond the scope of this paper.The Dakotaformation is found at depths ranging between 7,000 and 8,000 ft, currentlymaking it the deepest productive interval in the San Juan basin.The MesaVerde group can be located at depths ranging between 4,500 and 6,500 ft and isalso composed of a series of Cretaceous formations.These consist of thePoint Lookout, Menefee, and Cliffhouse, from deepest to shallowest deposition,respectively.The Mesa Verde represents a group of subnormally pressuredreservoirs with original gradients having been measured at approximately 0.25psi/ft.However, continued pressure depletion of the Mesa Verde hasresulted in a reservoir gradient less than 0.15 psi/ft in most areas of the SanJuan basin.1Because of the low pressure gradients associated with the Mesa Verdeformations, it has become a standard practice of many operators to useair-drilling techniques.2 These techniques use compressed air, natural gas, ornitrogen as the drilling fluid to dramatically reduce the hydrostatic-head andequivalent-circulating density. While this practice eliminates the concernsover lost circulation during drilling, it can pose significant challenges toachieving a successful primary cement job. A successful primary cement job isoften measured according to effective zonal isolation, achieving the designedtop of cement, and avoidance of remedial cementing.This paper will discuss the challenges of achieving a successful primarycement job on an air-drilled well and how to design a lightweight cement slurryand casing configuration‚Äîinclusive of a DHC‚Äîto achieve a successful primarycement job.The experiences and evolution of a consecutive 6-year drillingprogram that produced 112 Mesa Verde and Mesa Verde/Dakota wells serves as thefoundation for support for these designs.However, for illustrationpurposes, the scope of this paper will be limited to the evolution of thesepractices on the 40 Mesa Verde and Mesa Verde/Dakota wells drilled in the 29-6Unit from 1998 through 2002.Fig. 3 is an aerial map of these welllocations in the 29-6 Unit.It shows the study wells to be distributedover 23 of the 36 sections within the 29-6 Unit.The 29-6 Unit was chosenbecause it exhibits the lowest fracture gradients in the Mesa Verde and wasconsidered the worst-case scenario for achieving a successful primary cementjob on the production string of casing.

AB  - AbstractInstalling an intelligent well system in an existing completion can help operating companies accelerate production, increase ultimate recovery, and reduce interventions. It is of particular interest when all three of these benefits can be achieved in the same well.This paper focuses on such a well, the two-zone oil producer EY-D11 located in the Eden-Yuturi field of Ecuador's Block 15, in which an intelligent well system (IWS) was installed in conjunction with an electric submersible pump (ESP) during the workover of an existing completion. The two main value drivers for implementing the intelligent completion were 1) the ability to commingle production from two zones to meet accelerated production goals while fulfilling governmental requirements of properly allocating production and 2) the ability to regulate water production from both zones during commingled production. Secondary drivers included reducing the need for well interventions, the desire to pull the completion easily to repair or replace the ESP, and the acquisition of additional knowledge regarding the performance of the upper zone. These value drivers were satisfied with a system whose key components included remotely operated hydraulic adjustable chokes controlled by a semi-automated surface control system; and a field-proven suite of downhole sensors composed of a venturi-type single-phase flow meter and pressure / temperature gauges with all sensors controlled via a single surface data acquisition unit. The intelligent well system satisfies the drivers by commingling flow from multiple zones while dealing simultaneously with the different characteristics of each zone to optimize production.The EY-D11 well currently has commingled production from an upper and lower zone utilizing a single ESP, gaining incremental production of 3,500 barrels/day over the previous single-zone ESP completion. Based on the successful installation and results from this well, a second identical intelligent completion system was installed in the EY-D15 well in the Eden-Yuturi field in April 2004. Three additional completions are scheduled for the field in 2004 using essentially the same system.IntroductionOccidental Exploration & Production Company (Oxy), through a leasing/production agreement with Petroproduccion (Ecuador's state oil company), operates Block 15 in the Oriente basin of eastern Ecuador. Block 15 includes the on-shore fields of Eden-Yuturi, Indillana, Yanaquincha, Paka and Limoncocha. Currently, 90 wells are being produced from these fields. Most of these fields are mature and use ESPs to enhance recovery. In early 2002, Oxy began to review potential benefits of installing intelligent completions in some of their ESP wells in order to commingle zones and accelerate production goals.Government restrictions prevented operators in the country from commingling production from multiple zones in the same well without properly allocating production for each zone. As a result of these restrictions and various challenges associated with ESP completions, Oxy chose to prove the intelligent completion concept by retrofitting a well in the Eden-Yuturi field with a system based on remotely operated hydraulically adjustable chokes and a full complement of downhole electronic instrumentation. Baker Oil Tools was selected as the lead contractor for the project, with responsibility for not only ensuring successful implementation of the intelligent well system, but also coordination of all equipment supplied from other contractors as well.For Oxy, success with this system would result in a favorable return on investment through increased revenue from maximizing incremental oil production while decreasing expenses by drilling fewer wells to satisfy daily and yearly production goals. Other benefits would result from enhanced flow management with the use of the surface control system, eliminating intervention previously required to shift sliding sleeves, and reducing water production and handling costs.

AB  - AbstractTwo-phase flow through wellhead chokes, including both critical and subcritical flow and the boundary between them, was studied. Data were gathered for air-water and air-kerosene flows through five choke diameters from 1/4 in. (6.35 mm) to 1/2 in. (12.7 mm), and results were compared to published correlations. A new theoretical model for predicting flow rates and the critical-subcritical flow boundary was tested against these data, as well as data from two published studies. The new model substantially improves the existing methods for predicting choke behavior in two-phase flow. IntroductionChokes are widely used in the petroleum industry to protect surface processing equipment from slugging, to protect surface processing equipment from slugging, to control flow rates from wells, to provide the necessary backpressure to a reservoir to avoid formation damage from excessive drawdown, to maintain stable pressure downstream from the choke and dampen large pressure fluctuations. Either critical or subcritical flow may exist. Since different methods apply for predicting choke behavior in these regimes, the prediction of the critical-subcritical flow boundary is also important. The majority of correlations available apply to critical flow only. Pressure drops through chokes can be substantial. For example, in critical flow the pressure downstream from the choke may be as low as pressure downstream from the choke may be as low as 50% or even 5% of the upstream pressure. Modern techniques, like Nodal* Analysis, of analyzing the entire production system require two-phase models of production system require two-phase models of comparable accuracy for each system component. Thus, to optimize the performance of the entire production system, an improved two-phase choke model is required. THEORY For the purpose of modeling, a wellhead choke can be treated as a restriction in a pipe. Two types of two-phase flow can exist in a choke: critical and subcritical flow. During critical flow, the flow rate through the choke reaches a maximum value with respect to the prevailing upstream conditions. The velocity of the fluids flowing through the restriction reaches the sonic or pressure wave propagation velocity for the two-phase fluid. This implies that the flow "choked" because downstream disturbances cannot propgate upstream. Therefore, decreasing the downstream propgate upstream. Therefore, decreasing the downstream pressure does not increase the flow rate. If the pressure does not increase the flow rate. If the downstream pressure is gradually increased, there Will be no change in either the flow rate or the upstream pressure until the critical-subcritical flow boundary pressure until the critical-subcritical flow boundary is reached. If the downstream pressure is increased slightly beyond the boundary conditions, both flow rate and upstream pressure are affected. The velocities of fluids passing through the choke drop below the sonic velocity of the upstream fluids. Here, the flow rate depends on the pressure differential and changes in the downstream pressure affect the upstream pressure. This behavior characterizes subcritical pressure. This behavior characterizes subcritical flow. Although it is often desirable to operate wells under critical flow conditions with uniform flow rate and downstream pressure, Fortunate' reports that a majority of wells in the field operate under subcritical conditions. However, most of the correlations available to petroleum industry are for critical flow. Existing Methods A complete model for two-phase flow through chokes should define the boundary between the critical and subcritical flow regimes and predict the functional relationships of flow rate through the choke and the pressure differential across the choke for a given set of fluid properties and flow conditions. Most existing methods model critical flow only and a few even attempt to define the criticalsubcritical flow boundary. These models are surveyed.

AB  - Abstract The original gas lift valve testing method which has been proposed by South West Research Institute, SWRI, is very slow and expensive. The current API testing method is based on the API RP 11 V2 procedure. This testing method is not sufficient for all the gas valves purposes. On the other hand, the gas valves just calibrated at the manufacturer based on the API code which may not satisfy the application at all because the calibration is in static conditions whereas the valve is working under dynamic modes. Application of this work is to test and calibrate the gas valve based on the best performance and efficiency at the wellbore location. This method which is based on concept of pressure decay is really unique, novel, and inexpensive. It can be carried out at the wellbore location. This method is able to determine the actual flowing area, stem travel, discharge coefficient, and load rate of valve during flowing conditions. The significant section is that this method will correct the API standards of calibrating for different applications which is a great progress in this field of action. Introduction Artificial lift comes to the play when the production of oil (formly water) is not done through natural well flow. Blow down can be useful for low water-cut systems.1 Gas lift often can enhance the low GOR reservoir performance. Apparently, with increasing GOR, gas lift becomes less effective. So, the need for gas lift is related to the GOR prediction. Gas lift is performing useful in deep water with long offset flowlines. The reason is because of reducing the chance of slug formation. The reason behind it is because of severe slugging occurrence the relatively low production rates which make the gas lift a must at the beginning. Blowdown technique is more limited in downhill flowlines rather than uphill flowlines. In this system gas is continuously injecting through the casing or tubing and push the pass through some valves located in designated places and lift the volume of the liquid above. In this process, the gas lifts a slug of liquid each time. Setting the gas lift valves, GLV, is critical to the production. The GLVs should be set based on their initial opening pressure decreasing from surface level to the sandface, meaning when the top valve is getting ready to open; all the valves below are open. Selecting the GLVs port sizes and the distance between them as well as the initial opening pressure of each valve should be calculated and adjusted accurately to get the aimed results. The GLV is the most important component in such a design. The nitrogen-charged bellow pressure in the GLV may changes due to the temperature change from the surface to the bottomhole which should get calibrated and corrected before each installation for the best performance. Valve Performance Models There are a lot of attempts has been carried out throughout this mean. Some works 1 tried to bring a statistical modeling to predict the gas passage through the valve but some apparatus errors never let that go through. Correcting the facility error by another fellow 2 ended up to a correlation. This paper 2 proposed a criterion based on test rack opening pressure, Ptro, to differentiate between orifice and throttling flow. Eq. 1 and Eq. 2 bring the developed correlation for gas passage through orifice flow and throttling flow respectively.

AB  - Abstract Production metering of a Saudi Arabian rich gas condensate reservoir with an average condensate to gas ratio (CGR) of 330 stock tank barrels/million standard cubic feet (STB/MMscf) is under evaluation. Inapplicability of Venturi meters, due to high liquid production, accompanied by the absence of multiphase flow meters and dedicated permanent test separator facility for individual testing, has resulted in a major metering challenge during the production life of this field. Infrequent deliverability tests with costly portable test separators are the only way to obtain direct and accurate gas and condensate rate measurements, which has severely affected the rate allocation accuracy. In this study, an alternative solution was employed to improve gas rate allocation and target rate compliance. Understanding the nature of multiphase flow through chokes and the principals of flow calculations to derive accurate correlations and models is the only alternative to mitigate the lack of surface metering devices in such a high CGR environment. Choke equations rely heavily on choke parameters, surface measurements, and fluid properties with some assumed empirical constants. The majority of the published choke correlations have their unique empirical constants that fit the flow conditions and fluid properties of the studied fields. In this study, a numerical optimization technique was implemented to develop and brand two empirical choke correlations, which model the gas condensate flow through chokes under critical flow conditions in the subject field. An iterative methodology was performed by capitalizing on a nonlinear algorithm to analyze 64 well test data points, collected from 16 different separator tests, to identify the unique values of the empirical constants, which would yield the most accurate flow rate estimations. Statistical evaluation results indicate the developed empirical choke models yielded encouraging results. The models successfully matched the measured gas flow rates, from 26 well tests, with less than 5% average absolute error, proving the high accuracy of these models in estimating the flow rates. In addition, back allocation task was greatly simplified by utilizing these developed choke equations. Comparison between the total field choke equation estimated rate and measured field gas rate at the gas plant for a period of 3 months showed an outstanding agreement with less than 5% average error and 1.02 average allocation factor. Moreover, the investigated empirical constants were examined in a different field with similar fluid properties and obtained excellent matching outcomes as well, reconfirming the precision of these correlations in estimating the gas rates in a high CGR environment. The applications of these correlations will allow field operators to accurately estimate the flow rates without the necessity of conducting frequent costly separator tests, or installing expensive permanent multiphase flow meters.

AB  - AbstractIn most heavy oil fields, steam is generated at large centralized plants and distributed through complex piping networks to numerous injection wells. Thornhill-Craver critical flow chokes are commonly used to control the steam rates to each injection well. Unfortunately, pressure loss across the chokes must exceed 40% to maintain critical flow conditions. Consequently, steam must be generated at a pressure greater than twice the required wellhead injection pressure.In theory, critical flow conditions can be achieved with tapered-bore chokes with only 10% to 20% pressure loss. Although straight-bore and tapered-bore chokes follow the same critical flow principles, the tapered-bore design allows for a more efficient means of controlling flow rate. One obvious advantage of using tapered-bore chokes is the reduced steam generation pressure required to achieve and maintain critical flow. The pressure upstream of the tapered-bore choke need only be about 1.2 times the downstream wellhead pressure.This paper examines the effectiveness of tapered-bore chokes for controlling steam rates, evaluates the accuracy of the Thornhill-Craver equation for calculating critical flow rates, and presents a set of practical guidelines and procedures for applying tapered-bore chokes to efficiently and cost- effectively control and monitor steam rates to injection wells.IntroductionControlling and monitoring steam flow to injection wells is an important element of steamflood reservoir management. Valves, nozzles, orifice plates and critical flow chokes are typically used to regulate steam flow. Of these devices, critical flow chokes have proven to be a very reliable and cost effective means of controlling wellhead steam rates.A Thornhill-Craver choke with a removable straight-bore bean insert, shown in Figure 1, is the most commonly used choke configuration. The choke assembly consists of a 2-inch cage nipple (or bean housing) threaded into a tee junction that is equipped with a hammer union for safe insertion and removal of the critical flow bean. The drain plug is typically replaced with a blowdown valve prior to installation in the steam line.Under critical flow conditions, steam flow rate depends only on upstream pressure, steam quality, and bean size. Hence, for a given steam quality, the flow rate can be controlled by setting the upstream pressure or the bean size. The main disadvantage of straight-bore chokes is the large pressure drop required. Hence, chokes are not typically used when the steam supply pressure is considered to be too low, or when the sandface injection pressure is considered to be too high, to establish and maintain critical flow conditions.In theory, tapered-bore chokes can be used in place of straight-bore chokes to achieve critical flow with considerably less pressure loss. A conventional Thornhill-Craver choke assembly is used, along with a tapered-bore bean insert, shown in Figure 2. Critical flow is achieved in the bean throat, but, the tapered exit section acts as a diffuser that promotes pressure recovery. Steam pressure exiting the choke can be as high as 80% to 85% of the upstream pressure.Critical Flow PrinciplesBy definition, critical flow of a compressible fluid occurs when the fluid reaches sonic velocity in the bean throat. A shock wave develops and the flow is said to be choked.P. 269

AB  - Abstract The Heterogeneity Index (HI) process was utilized in order to demonstrate production gain opportunities in a very short period of time, in a large mature ME field with around 500 wells producing from different reservoirs. The HI process provided a quick screening method of identifying preliminary candidate wells with anomalous behavior (over/under performance) for further analysis and most importantly, provided the foundation for the overall Structure Production Approach. This process; HI, can be calculated by utilizing OFM. A Cross Hair Plot has also been utilized to show the comparison of the HI of two variables in the same plot, creating an easy way to identify wells behaving differently from the average. The cross hair plot can be combined with X-Y Coordinated plot which reproduces the location of the wells. The results from this screening tool were utilized to identify the families of productivity problems at field level, and additional fast screening was done at well level to identify candidates for production enhancement. Representative Wells were selected for detailed diagnostics based on the relevance and size of productivity impact and, the potential of its production rate or well deliverability. Once a few "top potential?? wells were identified, production engineering workflows were implemented in order to assess and forecast the potential of production incremental and try to determine and evaluate the best probable action.

AB  - Abstract Multiphase flow occurs in almost all producing oil wells and nearly every flowing well has some sort of choke to regulate the flowing rate, for the following reasons: (1) to maintain sufficient back pressure to prevent sand entry, (2) to protect surface equipment from high pressure, (3) to prevent gas or water coning and (4) to produce the reservoir at the optimum flow rate. Present choke correlations are best used for the area where same conditions met with the data used to generate the correlations. Inaccurate flow rate predictions could lead to gas/water coning, sand entry, and excessive pressures at the separator which can be a major factor of killing the producer well. In this paper, actual data production tests from vertical wells from Sabriyah Fields in Kuwait, were utilized to establish a new generalized multiphase flow choke correlation that predicts liquid flow rates as a function of flowing wellhead pressure, gas-liquid ratio, and surface wellhead choke size. The primary proposed correlation exhibits more accuracy (only 4% average error) than the existent correlations. The multiphase correlation coefficient was determined as 89%. These results will undoubtedly encourage the production engineer to utilize the proposed correlation for future practical answers when a lack of available information, time, and calculation capabilities arises. Introduction In a producing well, choke is controlling the production, as well as valves installed for safety purposes. One of the reasons for using choke is to prevent water and gas coning. Much research¬†has been conducted to describe the relationship between the flow rates through wellhead and choke size.¬† There are two surface conditions under which a flowing well is produced, either using a choke or using no restrictions at all. The majority of flowing wells are produced against chokes. Chokes are used to control flow rates, and thus to produce reservoirs at optimum rates. This also prevents water and/or gas coning and sand problems. Another use of well head chokes is to monitor production¬†rates by operating in the sub critical-flow region, especially when oil and gas are produced from offshore or hostile environments. Flow through the choke can be described as either critical or sub-critical. In a critical flow region, the mass flow rate reaches a maximum value that is independent of a pressure drop applied across the choke. Therefore, once critical flow is reached, any disturbance introduced downstream of the choke will have no effect on upstream conditions. Therefore, chokes are commonly operated on upstream conditions. Hence,¬†chokes are commonly operated under critical-flow conditions to isolate the reservoir from pressure fluctuations introduced by surface equipment.

AB  - AbstractReplacement of existing steel choke and kill lines on a drilling riser string with composite lines will result in weight savings that will allow third generation mobile offshore drilling units to operate in 6,000 feet of water depth without undergoing major upgrades. The design and analysis, fabrication and qualification testing of high pressure (15,000 psi) composite choke and kill lines is discussed. The objective is to develop a low-cost composite design of reliability equivalent to that of existing metal systems.IntroductionReplacement of the steel choke and kill lines on a standard drilling riser string with composite tubulars will result in a 15%-20% weight saving. Table 1 is a weight comparison of a typical 4.5" steel choke and kill line with a comparable composite line. This straightforward substitution would allow a third generation mobile offshore drilling unit (MODU) to operate in water depths as great as 6,000 feet without major upgrades. One of the limiting factors in taking a MODU out into deepwater and ultra-deepwater is the deckload capacity of the vessel. Mooring lines, riser joints, hook, and variable loads all contribute to this weight. A variety of other limitations require third generation semisubmersibles to undergo major upgrades before they can operate in water depths as great as 6,000 feet.For composite lines to be widely accepted, they must be designed to be 100% interchangeable with existing steel lines, with no modifications required to the riser pipe body, flange, brackets or buoyancy modules. When installed on a steel main riser pipe and flange joint, these composite lines create a hybrid drilling riser system. Such hybrid riser joints would then be completely interchangeable with the all-steel riser joints of a deepwater riser system.The market focus for a hybrid riser system is very specific. The drilling and production units being targeted are those third generation rigs on the edge of deepwater that want to be able to drill in 6,000 feet of water without undergoing major upgrades. The use of hybrid riser joints will lighten deckload, hookload and craning requirements for these MODU"s. Equally important is the reduction in the volume of syntactic foam buoyancy needed to support the riser joints underwater. Foam modules with a smaller outside diameter can be used, allowing the hybrid riser to be run by many of the vessels operating on the fringe of deepwater which still have 49.5- inch rotary tables. Another advantage to the use of smaller diameter buoyancy is the narrower profile of the riser string in the water, which reduces the drag forces of the sea currents.Composite Choke and Kill Line RequirementsThe API specification for choke and kill systems (Ref. 1) states that: "Choke and Kill Lines are an integral part of the surface blowout prevention equipment required for well control. The kill line provides a means of pumping fluid into the well bore when normal circulation through the drill string cannot be employed.

AB  - AbstractA design of chokes in series has been carried out in order to minimize sand erosion in choke boxes and beams. A multiphase flow simulation program was developed to determine the size of the choke orifices and the sequence of installation. Previous field experience determined beneficial effect of using chokes coated in their internal area from end to end with tungsten carbide.Failures in choke boxes and beams have been occurring in about 59 out of the 222 production strings in the North of Monagas area in Venezuela to the present time. In fact, 139 failures due to sand erosion occurred during 1996 causing repair costs of about $339000.The installation of a design consisting of chokes in series at the well head, drastically minimizes sand erosion, reducing production losses, oil leaks, maintenance costs and unsafe operations.The multiphase flow simulation program based design resulted in the installation of three chokes in series protecting them from sand erosion in the two wells evaluated. During five (5) months, the pre-established period of time for analysis, well No. 1 kept producing continuously. Visual inspection confirmed that no sand erosion had occurred in any of the chokes.IntroductionHigh gas and oil rates associated to sand production with high well head pressures passing through one choke box with conventional material usually causes erosion of the beam and its choke box; the severity of the erosion process may deteriorate them completely, giving place to leaks. Sand production erodes the internal parts of a well head including wing valves, tees, subsurface safety valves, choke boxes and beams affecting the well safety system and production operations. These accessories are inspected periodically, and frequently, they have to be repaired or replaced. This type of failure causes deferred production and dedication of production crews to correct erosion problems affecting operational costs.Research has been carried out on the erosive processes in materials with and without the presence of sand. In the oil industry, an API formula has been developed to predict the limit velocity for flow of fluids, above which an erosive process, in non corrosive environments and without the presence of solid particles, can be initiated. Deffenbaugh showed results on the erosion velocity for carbon steels excluding its application for flow restrictions as chokes. Likewise, Deffenbaugh proposed a formula to predict erosion velocity in the presence of sand. Sontvedt reported the limit velocities for erosion for carbon steels in the absence of corrosive fluids based upon studies of materials for chokes, and also for other special materials resistant to erosion.

AB  - Abstract An operator in India desired two modular, skid-mounted, plug-and-play quick production facilities (QPF) with the capacity for quick relocation and commissioning within multiple fields. This paper discusses the successful solution presented by the service company using an economic, flexible, and reliable QPF model. It also discusses challenges related to flow assurance, limited infrastructure, and compliance with the India Directorate General of Mines Safety (DGMS) challenges. The QPF model consists of process skids, utility and storage systems, interconnected piping, data acquisition (DAQ), and a power distribution system. The well flowline is routed through an indirect water bath heater (IWBH) and three-phase separator. Oil from the separator transfers to the export oil storage tank and loading gantry. Water travels to the evaporation pond through a skimmer tank, and gas is transferred to the burn pit through a knockout drum (KOD). Liquid accumulated in the KOD is transferred to the storage tank. A closed drain maintenance vessel and alarm system is also included. The operator used a service company to engineer, procure, install, and commission two QPFs. From a process perspective, the primary challenges encountered included flow assurance related to the presence of a variety of oils and wax with high wax appearance temperature (WAT), limited existing infrastructure in the very remote location, and compliance with the India DGMS standards. After all of the equipment/skids arrived on location, the operator requested the installation of the QPFs within a short period of time. A team consisting of local contractors and global personnel from various disciplines was assembled to meet the challenge. This team included personnel from project management, mechanical and piping, electrical and instrumentation, and construction and commissioning. The installation and commissioning of the first QPF was completed in 45 days. After applying lessons learned from the first installation, the second QPF installation was completed in only 25 days. The commissioning of the facilities in such a short time period was the result of collaborative work from both the operator and the service company. Two modular, skid-mounted, plug-and-play QPFs with the capacity for quick relocation and commissioning within multiple fields were installed in very remote locations in India. This paper discusses challenges encountered and addressed during the operation using an economic, flexible, and reliable QPF model. Lessons learned during the first operation enabled a much faster completion of the second QPF, thus exceeding operator expectations.

AB  - Summary Flow-rate prediction of oil production wells is of prime importance to effectively confront high-water-cut and separator problems. (Semi-) empirical multiphase-flow correlations are proved quite useful for this purpose. This work presents new generalized multiphase flow choke correlation, derived on the basis of actual production data from horizontal and vertical wells from an oil field in Iran. The newly established correlation predicts liquid flow rates as a function of flowing wellhead pressure, gas/liquid ratio, surface wellhead choke size, and the newly incorporated parameters: basic sediment and water (BS&W) and temperature. To evaluate the influence of these two new parameters, a parameter-sensitivity analysis was performed and the results are shown. This proposed correlation exhibited an average error of roughly 2.89%, which is superior to those previous correlations in the literature that did not use these two newly incorporated parameters (BS&W and temperature). These new parameters can be added to the previous correlations when the water cut and temperature become important in the production history of the wells. Introduction The phenomenon of multiphase flow (liquid and gas) happens in the wellhead of the majority of the producing wells. As the regulation of the flow rate becomes important during the production period in the producing wells, chokes are used for isolating the underground reservoir from pressure variations in the surface equipment, and also they are used for preventing or reducing the water production. Larger amounts of produced water from oil recovery result in increasing of operating costs and are a major environmental concern for oil production (Jin and Wojtanowicz 2010). Although numerous multiphase-flow correlations are included in the literature (Al-Attar 2010), almost all of them are limited to a special operational condition in which the correlations are driven. As a result, the strength of those correlations for predicting the actual flow rate is restricted. Gilbert (1954) developed the most popular multiphase flow surface choke correlation, but this correlation is valid for the critical flow condition when the upstream pressure of the choke is 70% or more higher than the downstream pressure (Ghareeb and Shedid 2007). Flow through the wellhead chokes is mainly divided into two critical and subcritical conditions. Within this manuscript, the critical-flow condition refers to the state at which the flow rate reaches a maximum amount independent of the downstream and upstream pressure difference of the choke. Empirical correlations are mainly used for critical-flow condition.

AB  - SummaryAsphaltene deposition in the tubing and production facilities caused operational problems in the Ula reservoir. Laboratory and field studies were carried out to determine the point of asphaltene precipitation. Laboratory observations were made on the regimes of precipitation. Laboratory observations were made on the regimes of deposition as a function of decreasing pressure down to and below the bubblepoint of "live" crude oil samples. The tubing areas affected by deposition in the field corresponded to those identified in the laboratory and by subsequent pressure and temperature modeling of the wells. Large asphaltene deposits were also found in the production separators.IntroductionUla Reservoir. The Ula field, operated by BP Petroleum Development (Norway), is situated in the Norwegian sector of the North Sea, 280 km southwest of Stavanger. A dip-closed salt-dome strucmm in the Upper Jurassic sandstone, the Ula reservoir is located 3345 m below the seabed. Oil produced has a gravity of 0.83 g/cm 3 with a GOR of 97.263 std m/m. The asphaltene content of the reservoir old is 0.57 wt%. Reservoir temperature is 143 deg. C and initial pressure was 49 054 kPa.History of Operational Problems on Ula. Downhole Safety Valves. In Nov. 1986, the downhole safety valves (DHSV's) in the two producing wells, Wells A and B, became increasingly difficult to open. The valves were removed and examined (Fig. 1). A black material later identified as asphaltenes had deposited in the valves and interfered with the opening mechanism. The deposited asphaltenes increased the friction between the flow tube and the valve housing and prevented the valves from opening with normal surface hydraulic pressures. The valves were modified to increase the opening and closing forces to overcome the extra friction.Wireline Operations. The asphaltene deposition in the well tubing caused a number of problems during wireline runs. Access to wireline plugs was hampered by asphaltene settling on top of the plugs. Wireline tools were damaged by asphaltenes, interfering with plugs. Wireline tools were damaged by asphaltenes, interfering with their operations. These problems led to extensive delays in wireline operations, and changes to running procedures were required. Equipment modifications were required to overcome these problems. problems. Production Facilities. In Aug. 1987, the two main separators on Ula were opened for inspection and 25 Mg of asphaltenes was found inside. The asphaltenes had built up to the weir levels within the separator over a period of 9 months. As a result of asphaltene compaction, the asphaltenes could be removed only by being dug out manually (Fig. 2).Production Restrictions. Asphaltenes were found to deposit on the well tubing wall below (in terms of depth) the crude's bubblepoint. This has also been observed in the Hassi-Messahoud and Ventura fields. However, the downhole flowing pressures are large enough in Ula for the restriction caused by asphaltene deposition in the production tubing to have no significant effect on the oil pro-duction. Multiphase modeling indicated only a small increase i pro-duction. Multiphase modeling indicated only a small increase i frictional pressure drop along the tubing attributable to asphaltenes. if the downhole flowing pressures drop significantly, then the potential for future production restrictions still exists. potential for future production restrictions still exists. Background of AsphaltenesAsphaltenes are a constitutent of the heavier and polar fraction of crude oils. The remaining polar species are resins and aromatics. Structural studies indicate that the asphaltene and resin molecules have a similar molecular weight range of 500 to 1,000. Asphaltenes, however, can form aggregates with molecular-weight distribution of 103 to 105. These aggregates are stabilized in solution by the resins and aromatics, which act as peptizing agents. When this protective shield is removed by preferential dissolution of the resins into the fluid phase (e.g., on addition of an alkaline), the asphaltene molecules start flocculating and aggregating into particles large enough to result in deposition. particles large enough to result in deposition. Asphaltenes are broadly classified as n-heptane insolubles or n-pentane insolubles. Resins can be defined as the fraction of oil not soluble in ethylacetate but soluble in n-heptane, toluene, and benzene at room temperature.

This paper describes the system andthe key development activities that led to the project goal of a fullydeveloped system design. project goal of a fully developed system design.IntroductionStatoil conceived the UPS in 1984. After a year of in-house development,Statoil approached Mobil with a proposal to pursue the development jointly. InSept. 1986, the two companies staffed and funded the program, which wascompleted in early 1989. The sponsoring companies were interested primarily inthe development of the capability to produce hydrocarbons safely from fieldsbeyond diver depth, using "wet" technology. In the wake of the recentoil-price collapse, added emphasis was placed on the economic aspects of such acapability. The agreed-upon objective of the UPS project was to provide a fullydeveloped design of a system for application in the early 1990's. Thefeasibility of the system was to be verified through system engineering andfabrication/testing of selected hardware.Basic Design PhilosophyThe design basis for the UPS was drawn from North Sea experience.Conservative conditions were selected and extremes, which would haveexcessively driven the design, were avoided. The principal design parameterswere as follows. principal design parameters were as follows. 1. Northern NorthSea environment. 2. A 20-km distance to the field control center. 3. A depth of400 m to guideline limits. 4. A design life of 20 years. 5. Six well slots,dedicated to either template or satellite trees. 6. A 14 300-m3-fluid/d peakproduction. 7. Maximum wellhead pressures of 35 MPa. 8. A wellhead temperatureof 100 degrees C. 9. CO2 and H2S service. 10. Multifunctional inhibitordelivery to each tree.

The subsea station flow diagram was established to meet thedesign philosophy and to satisfy the design requirements of the system. Allactive components subject to failure were modularized to permit theirretrieval. The flow diagram indicates the following equipment (Fig. 1). 1. SixChristmas trees dedicated to production. Each tree is split into a lowerChristmas tree, an upper Christmas tree, and a tree cap. The lower Christmastree is a safety block. The upper tree contains most of the valves and can beretrieved for maintenance without killing the well. The dual 7.5-cm productiontubing design was selected for its compatibility with the desired flow capacityand with the TFL philosophy. 2. One manifold module for production comminglingand distribution of service fluids throughout the subsea station. 3. Oneselector module for routing TFL service tools to the appropriate well tubing.4. Interconnecting piping interfacing with these modules and the flowlines. Thepiping includes valves for flowline isolation. This equipment is installed in atemplate that is secured to the seabed. Modules are retrievable for maintenanceand replacement. The interconnecting piping, designed to avoid maintenanceduring the design life of the subsea station, is integrated into the templatestructure. The flow diagram shows two production flowlines that form a loop,thereby facilitating pigging and giving flexibility to the system. Should thefield characteristics and total economy make it more attractive, the secondproduction flowline can be deleted and a subsea pig launcher can be fitted inthe vicinity of or at the connection point of this flowline to the templatepiping. This paper assumes the use of two production flowlines.Production Control System. The production control system (Fig. ProductionControl System. The production control system (Fig. 2) is a redundantelectrohydraulic multiplex system that uses waterbased hydraulic fluid.Hydraulic power and electrical power/ signals are supplied from the fieldcontrol center by means of an electro-hydraulic umbilical. The umbilicalconnects to a connection frame on the subsea station. The connection frameincludes a separately retrievable utility pod containing passive equipment andcrossover facilities for power and signal distribution to control pods invarious modules. The control pods are retrieved separately to the surface formaintenance by the dedicated ROT. To limit the number of subsea make/breakconnections between the modules and the control pods, nonretrievabledata-acquisition pods are installed in each upper Christmas tree, the manifoldmodule, and the selector module. They collect sensor data before onwardtransmission to the relevant control pod. Typical sensors in the modulesinclude pressure and temperature transducers, position indicators, TFL toolsensors, and hydrocarbon leak detectors.Layout and Protection System.

AB  - Summary Use of wellhead chokes to monitor and control well flow rates and to protect the reservoir from surface pressure fluctuations is quite common. This study investigates the use of multiple-orifice-valve (MOV) chokes in the critical-flow region. Experimental data collected for a high-pressure air/water system show that conventional relationships are not successful in analyzing the experimental data for MOV chokes. A new relationship based on the sonic velocity of two-phase homogeneous mixtures is developed for the prediction of the critical-flow transition. The procedure uses choking, rather than liquid sonic velocity, as the criterion for critical flow in the liquid phase. The procedure is iterative but compensates for its complexity with high reliability and generality. The new relationship is validated by experimental data. Introduction Wellhead chokes are installed on wells to control flow rates and to protect the reservoir and surface equipment from pressure fluctuations. Flow through the choke can be described as either critical or subcritical. In the critical-flow region, the mass flow rate reaches a maximum value that is independent of the pressure drop applied across the choke. Therefore, once critical flow is reached, any dis-turbance introduced downstream of the choke will have no effect on upstream conditions. Therefore, chokes are commonly operated under critical-flow conditions to isolate the reservoir from pressure fluctuations introduced by surface processing equipment. A second use of wellhead chokes is to monitor production rates by operating in the subcritical-flow region, especially when oil and gas are produced from offshore or hostile environments. For these applications, it is advantageous to use MOV chokes that allow the size of the choke opening to be changed while the choke is under pressure without interruption of production. With this feature, the pressure drop across the choke, and thereby manipulation of the flow rate, can be remotely controlled. Surbey et al. I discussed in detail the application of MOV chokes in the subcritical-flow region. This investigation presents the application of MOV chokes in the critical-flow region. The limitations of conventional correlations in predicting critical-flow behavior for MOV chokes is also discussed. A new correlation is presented to predict the transition between critical and subcritical flow that is applicable to conventional chokes as well. Literature Review Several investigators have published correlations to predict the tran-sition between critical and subcritical flow. Wallis developed relationship to predict the sonic velocity in a two-phase homogeneous mixture. The equation can be written as (1) The liquid sonic velocity, v*, is assumed to have a constant value of 4,950 ft/sec [1509 m/s] for water, and the gas sonic velocity, v* is calculated from (2) When the mixture velocity in the choke throat equals the sonic velocity predicted from Eq. 1, critical flow is reached. Fortunati proposed a different correlation to predict sonic velocity. Using a no-slip condition between the phases, he propose that the sonic velocity of the mixture be given by (3) which assumes no mass transfer between the phases. He also proposed a relationship to predict the flow rate in the critical flow region assuming a discharge coefficient ranging from 1.02 to 1.035, depending on choke size. Ashford and Pierce derived an equation to predict the upstream-to-downstream-pressure ratio at the critical-flow transition. The liquation assumed that the derivative of mass flow rate with respect to this pressure ratio is zero at critical-flow conditions. The inherent assumptions were that the gas expands polytropically, that no slippage occurs between the phases, that the liquid is incompressible, and that frictional losses are negligible in the choke. One of the uncertainties of the model, as stated by Ashford and Pierce, is the definition of p . Ideally, p is the lowest pressure reached in the choke. In practice, this value cannot be measured easily and without uncertainty. Using their relationship for the occurrence of critical flow, Ashford and Pierce developed an equation to predict critical flow rates. In predicting these flow rates, they pointed out the uncertainties involved in precisely measuring the downstream pressure. Sachdeva et al. extended the work of Ashford and Pierce and proposed a relationship to predict the critical pressure ratio. They assumed that the gas phase at the choke entrance contracts isentropically but expands polytropically. Their model showed improvement over the Ashford and Pierce relationship for their own data. In addition to the above relationships, several investigators used field data to develop correlations to predict flow rates in the critical region. These relationships are of the form (4) where A, B, and C are constants given in Table 1 for various investigators. Gilberts reported that his correlation is very sensitive to changes in choke size and that an error of 1/128 in. [0. 198 mm] in d can introduce errors of 5 to 20% in the calculations. Omaha et al. developed an empirical correlation based on dimensionless groups. Regression coefficients were determined with experimental data obtained from a high-pressure natural-gas/water system. Two difficulties were evident in the prediction of the transition between subcritical and critical flow for MOV chokes. First, the measurement of p was difficult because of peculiarities in the choke design. As a result, the downstream pressure was measured only for fully recovered flow. Second, the shapes of the choke openings vary with choke design and cannot be defined as a simple circular hole. As MOV chokes are closed, the shape of the opening becomes more and more noncircular, creating a problem in defining an equivalent circular diameter. In view of these difficulties, a different approach was taken in analyzing critical-flow data. This approach was also found to be suitable for conventional chokes operating in critical flow. Results and Discussion The experimental data were divided into two groups, subcritical and critical flow, on the basis of a comparison of the downstream-to-upstream-pressure ratio to literature correlations. When all three correlations predicted a given data point to be in the critical region, that point was assumed to be critical. All other tests were grouped in the subcritical region. This procedure was necessary because direct identification of critical two-phase flow was not possible owing to the design of the test facilities. The overall range of experimental parameters is given in Table 2.he simplest method to correlate the critical flow data was through the use of a Gilbert-type relationship, such as Eq. 4.

AB  - ABSTRACTA unique chemical mixture of dilute hydrochloric acid and an organic sulfonic acid has proved to be very effective in increasing the production of oil in both sand and limestone formations by removing aqueous and bentonitic blocking materials. Hundreds of wells have been treated in the past 18 months with very encouraging overall results. Continued use of the material will undoubtedly further define its additional uses and determine the areas of greatest effectiveness in re-establishing the original permeability of the oil-producing formations The simplicity of application is of importance in such a process, but the analyses of the well itself to determine the cause of low oil production must not be neglected. Therefore, the chemical mixture will be of benefit only when a blocking condition exists that meets the above outlined requirements. The material is not a cure-all for every production difficulty, but is a valuable link in the chain of processes that are helping It is a well-known and accepted fact that drilling into an oil-producing formation can result in impairment of the normal permeability and create restrictions to the flow of fluids to the well bore. This phenomenon has been shown hundreds of times where formation characteristics, as disclosed by cores, drill-stem tests, and electric logs, indicate a potential production that is not developed when the well is completed in the zone in question. Many wells have been abandoned which, in view of presently known facts, might have been made into satisfactory producers. Older producing wells, which were once good oil producers, are frequently damaged during the performance of various kinds of remedial work and quite often prove difficult to recomplete to the previous production rate. Phenomenal results from relatively small acid treatments in limestone formations or shooting in sandstone formations have demonstrated that both rotary and cable-tool drilled wells have been plugged but a short distance from the well bore. This blocking action has lately been termed \"skin effect,\" and its influence on the productivity of wells has been described in a recent article.1 This skin effect, however, should not be limited to a small radius around the well bore because the blocking materials can penetrate highly permeable formations, crevices, and fractures to a considerable distance. Any process or technique to re-establish as much of the normal permeability as possible must then consider the nature and causes of the blocking action. These causes vary from field to field, which complicates a general description of the problem; but it is believed that a broad discussion of the more prevalent troubles will be of value at this point. Unless a well is drilled in with oil or an oil-base mud, the presence of water in the system is necessary and the unavoidable filtrate from a water-base mud can act in several ways to reduce permeability. Recent findings2,3 have shown that drilling fluids can penetrate appreciable distances into oil-bearing formations. Mud losses barely noticeable while drilling or running casing can be sufficient to plug the well. Additional studies have disclosed that excessive pressures created during drilling and running of casing may often force large quantities of drilling fluids into the formation. Even very small losses to the formation may be sufficient to plug the well within a short radius.

AB  - AbstractSeveral correlations of critical and subcritical two-phase flow through wellhead chokes were evaluated to test their application to Middle East oil fields. Two groups of correlations describing two-phase flow through wellhead chokes were examined. The first group involved simple empirical equations similar to those of Gilbert(1). Two new correlations were proposed: one for critical and the other for subcritical flow regimes. The second group comprised derived equations of two-phase flow incorporating PVT properties. PVT correlations developed for the Middle East crudes were employed. These correlations were tested for a wide range of field data obtained from several Middle East countries.Selection of the best correlation was justified by statistical error analysis, range of validity, and number of involved variables to be measured in the field. Our simple version of correlations provided more accurate results than any other correlation involving the same variables. Incorporation of the PVT correlations for produced fluid properties of the Middle East oil fields improved the accuracy of the derived models.The developed correlations were useful for accurate prediction of choke performance of the Middle East oil wells. The proposed empirical correlations are applicable for various types of reservoir fluids, including black oil, volatile oil, and gas condensate fluids. These correlations do not require knowledge of PVT properties of the produced fluids.IntroductionChokes are commonly used in oil and gas production systems. A choke is a restriction basically designed to control flow rates of oil and gas wells, to impose a back pressure on the formation protecting it from damage, to prevent the downstream disturbances from propagating upstream (critical flow), and to protect the surface equipment facilities against slugging at high flowing pressures.Several approaches have been suggested for the prediction of multiphase flow through chokes. These approaches can be classified into four groups. The first group consists of correlations similar to the one originally proposed by Gilbert(1). This equation has been further modified by Ros(2), Secen(3), Baxendell(4), Achong(5), Pilehvari(6), and Osman and Dokla(7). These correlations were developed for the critical flow regime. In such correlations, the PVT properties of the produced fluids were neglected. Some of these correlations are claimed to be valid for downstream to upstream pressure ratios up to 0.7(1).The second group combines the empirical correlations for critical flow through chokes with fluid properties. The correlations belonging to this group include Poettmann and Beck(8), Al-Attar and Abdul-Majeed(9), and Al-Towailib and Al-Marhoun(10). Poettmann and Beck(8) converted Ros's correlation to graphical forms for 20, 30, and 40 ¬∞ API crudes. These correlations are restricted to critical two-phase flow of wells producing clean oil. Al-Attar and Abdul-Majeed(9) modified Gilbert's(1) equation by including the API gravity of the crude oil. However, they recommended the use of more field data to test their correlation. Al- Towailib and Al-Marhoun(10) introduced the effect of gas-oil mixture density into an empirical correlation that describes fluid flow in chokes. This correlation is limited for critical flow, neglects solution GOR, and requires knowledge of the specific gravity of the produced gas and oil.

AB  - AbstractAccurate prediction of multi-phase flow through chokes is required formodern production design and optimization of oil well performance. Most of theMiddle-East oil wells are uniquely characterized with high production rates.Several correlations that relate the choke size with other variables involvedin the multi-phase flow phenomena have been proposed in the literature. Thevalidity of these correlations for Middle-East oil wells has been assessed inthis study.A new correlation has been developed to describe the choke performance ofthe Middle-East oil wells. The proposed correlation is similar to theOmana-type correlations based on dimensional analysis. This correlation wasexamined against a wide range of well test data collected from various oilfields in Egypt, Kuwait, Libya, and other Middle-East countries. Statisticalanalysis was used to compare to accuracy of the results obtained from the newcorrelation with those from other correlations. The effect of different PVTcorrelations on the predictive accuracy of the fluid flow equations has beenalso investigated. These properties included the surface tension of the gas/oilsystem, gas compressibility factor, solution GOR, and oil volume factor.The developed correlation provided highly accurate results compared to theother existing correlations. This correlation is applicable for critical flowconditions and requires knowledge of the PVT data. This study showed that theuse of different PVT correlations resulted in slight variation in the accuracyof the developed correlation.Further analysis has been conducted in the present study on the Gilbert-typeempirical correlations. Results emphasized the linear relationship between flowrate and upstream pressure for critical flow.IntroductionThe choke is an important element in the well production system. One of themain functions of choke is to control flow. The pressure drop is an importantfactor influencing the pressurization of the formation and as a result theperformance and productivity of the well. A choke malfunctioning may cause thedownstream pressure disturbances to be transmitted upstream leading to damageof surface facilities or death of oil well. Therefore, the prediction of flowbehavior of multi-phase mixtures through chokes is of great industrial interestin the design and development of producing wells. Furthermore, moderntechniques are currently used in the design and optimization analysis over theentire production system. This analysis requires accurate models that candescribe the performance of each component in the system; including thewellhead choke. Several models of multi-phase flow through chokes exist in theliterature. Most of these models were developed for limited ranges ofproduction conditions. The magnitude of production rates of the flowing oilwells in the Middle-East countries is unique. Therefore, more research isneeded to justify the validity of the available models for Middle-East oilwells.Literature ReviewTwo-phase low through chokes may be either critical or subcritical. Most ofthe models presented in the literature were developed for critical flow. Thesemodels comprise the Gilbert-type1 empirical relationship. Thisrelationship was revised by Ros, 2 Baxendell,3 Achong,4 Pilehvari,5 Secen, 6 and Osman andDokla.7 These correlations consist basically of a three-parameterequation in which the flow rate is linearly proportional to the upstreampressure.

AB  - Abstract Conventional production logging with electric line is sometimes challenged by the presence of mechanical restrictions in the wellbore. The fragility of production logging tools also impedes the use of electric-line coiled tubing (CT) with the risk of damaging tools across sections with little clearance. This study showcases conclusive flow profiling using distributed temperature sensing (DTS) via fiber optics deployed with CT in a gas condensate well where wellbore access prevented the use of logging tools. Flow profiling via DTS has been used globally in completions where fiber optic lines are permanently installed. Interpretation of those logs usually leverages months of acquired data to invert temperature information and obtain the evolution of flow distribution over time. The proposed methodology instead relies on hours of DTS acquisition through the temporary deployment of fiber optics with CT. A comprehensive sensitivity analysis on key unknown parameters is then performed using a fit-for-purpose thermal-flow simulator to match simulated and acquired temperature profiles, leading to a flow distribution of gas, condensate, and oil in the wellbore. Before the intervention, an evaluation study was run using a flow-thermal simulator to evaluate the expected sensitivity of wellbore temperature to poorly characterized downhole parameters, such as permeability, pressure, or skin. This allows determining the downhole conditions under which DTS is able to detect flow contribution for a specific candidate. During the operation, the CT equipped with fiber optics was stationed across production zones for a total of 06 hours. The data was processed and fed back to the simulator along with reservoir, well data, and surface rates. To further constrain data processing, pressure surveys were acquired during the CT run using a downhole gauge, both during flow and shut-in periods. Unknown reservoir properties were sensitized during data interpretation to obtain a match between acquired DTS profiles and simulated wellbore temperature evolution, which, in turn, yielded an associated flow distribution. The matching exercise being an open-ended mathematical problem, several scenarios were considered, and their results checked against further production characterization of the wellbore and the field. The proposed case study illustrates how this methodology enabled logging in a mechanically-restricted zone and helped determining that the top interval was not contributing to flow.

AB  - AbstractWhen oil is produced under high water-cut conditions, oil in water emulsions can be formed. The break-up of oil droplets predominantly takes place in the choke valve. We have conducted laboratory experiments to investigate the effect of flow through a choke valve on the oil-droplet-size distribution in the emulsion. In these experiments the choke is modeled as a circular orifice in a pipe. The droplet sizes after break-up can be correlated to the mean energy dissipation rate per unit mass in the orifice. The experiments have been conducted with two set-ups on a different scale. The relation, which we have derived for the maximum stable droplet diameter downstream of the orifice can be applied to both scales. Furthermore the effect of oil viscosity on the droplet sizes after break-up has been investigated.

AB  - Summary Equations that describe isentropic (adiabatic with no friction loss) flow of multiphase mixtures through chokes can be deduced from the general energy equation. These flow equations are valid for both critical and subcritical flow. Equations, physical property correlations for oil/water/natural gas systems, and a property correlations for oil/water/natural gas systems, and a computer method that will handle both flow regimes are described. The procedure will determine whether flow will be in the critical or subcritical regime. The analysis method has been tested by comparing measured and calculated flow rates of 1,432 sets of literature data comprising both critical and subcritical air/water, air[kerosene, natural gas, natural gas/oil, natural gas/water, and water flows. An average discharge coefficient of 0.826 gave a negligible average error with a 15.4% standard deviation. Introduction In oil fields, it is a common practice to flow liquid and gas mixtures through chokes. Both surface and subsurface chokes may be installed to control flow rates and to protect the formation and surface equipment from unusual pressure fluctuations. In addition to installed chokes, irregular choke-like constrictions also may play a dominant role in limiting the flow rate from a blown-out play a dominant role in limiting the flow rate from a blown-out well. System that involve condensation of the gaseous phase, such as steam/water, are not considered in this paper. Also, flow conditions that would lead to choke throat pressures equal to or less than the vapor pressure of the water phase are not considered. Under "subcritical" flow conditions, the mass flow rate of a stream will be a function of the pressure downstream of the choke when the upstream pressure is held constant. If the pressure drop across the choke becomes sufficiently large, the flow regime will become "critical" and the mass flow rate will be independent of the downstream pressure when the upstream pressure is held constant. Several investigators have described studies of critical and subcritical flow. A thermodynamically based theory and empirical correlations have been reported. The empirical correlations generally are valid over the range where experimental data were available but may give poor results when extrapolated to new conditions. The literature shows little success in correlating the conditions that determine the boundary between critical and subcritical flow. The purpose of this paper is to review the thermodynamic basis, develop a theoretical framework, and show that this approach is valid for both subcritical and critical flow. Correlations of oil, gas, and water properties then are combined with the thermodynamic framework to yield a computer program for calculating isentropic flow. Discharge coefficients, which relate actual flow to ideal frictionless flow, were determined by use of experimental data available in the literature. Energy Balance for Multiphase Mixtures The thermodynamic framework for multiphase critical flow is based on the principal of conservation of energy. As a flowing mixture approaches a constriction, its velocity will increase and the pressure will fall. Little time or area is available for heat pressure will fall. Little time or area is available for heat transfer; thus, the expansion of the gaseous fraction is essentially adiabatic. Consequently, the temperature of the flowing mixture also changes. Beginning with the general energy equation, the relationship between variables at any point in the flowing system can be determined based on these assumptions (1) that temperature varies with position, but at any point, all phases are at the same temperature; (2) that velocity varies with position, but at any point, all components are moving with the same velocity; (3) that the gas compressibility factor is constant; (4) that the liquids have a negligible compressibility compared to gas; (5) that elevation changes are negligible; and (6) that the flow process is adiabatic and frictionless. Appendix A shows the derivation of equations that relate the pressure in the throat of the choke to the mass flow when the upstream pressure is known. The necessity to conserve energy leads to the pressure is known. The necessity to conserve energy leads to the interesting phenomenon that a maximum mass flow rate is achieved at a specific throat/upstream pressure ratio; the critical pressure ratio, however, depends on inlet conditions. As Appendix A shows, this critical flow condition can be determined by differentiation of the general energy equation.

AB  - Abstract This paper reports on experimental work focused on modifying choke design with the aim of reducing oil droplet break-up in the choke in high water-cut production wells. Producing oil under such conditions, with the oil dispersed in the produced water, leads to severe break-up of the dispersed oil droplets. This break-up is caused by high energy dissipation in the choke. Previous work carried out in Delft indicated that, under identical process circumstances (tubing diameter, flow-rate, pressure drop, oil type and concentration), the break-up process is significantly influenced by the choke geometry. In this work we discuss possible ways of modifying the choke geometry to reduce droplet break-up.Three model chokes were tested in the laboratory: an orifice, a small choke consisting of 7 parallel tubes and a larger choke consisting of 13 parallel tubes. These chokes were tested at identical flow rates and with the same pressure drop across the chokes. The larger model choke was the superior one in the sense that in this device the least break-up of oil droplets took place. In the small model choke more break-up occurred, while the most severe break-up was observed for the circular orifice. A general conclusion of the investigation is that the intensity of the break-up process occurring in the (model) choke can be considerably reduced by adaptation of the choke design. A choke design based on parallel tubes gives opportunities for improving the choke performance with regard to oil droplet break-up, while still making it possible to vary and control the volume flow-rate as with a conventional choke. This investigation suggests that it will be possible to construct chokes with improved characteristics with regard to oil-droplet break-up in high water-cut wells. This will result in easier separation and less emulsion-forming downstream of the choke. Introduction Production of oil from a reservoir usually implies that, at a certain point in time, water will be produced as well. While production and time progress, the percentage of water will increase. This situation will continue as long as the production of oil is economically feasible. In practice this means that commonly oil is produced under high water-cut conditions. This water-cut, i.e. the relative amount of water, can be of the order of 95-99 vol. %, and thus the produced fluids contain only a few percent of oil. Under high water-cut conditions the oil, as it enters the well-bore, will be dispersed in the water in the form of droplets. According to Janssen et al.1 the oil droplets have a wide distribution, with the common characteristic that the smallest droplets have a size of the order of 20 ¬µm. The precise value of this lower limit is determined by several parameters of which we mention: properties of the porous medium, in particular the permeability and the wettability, the fluid velocity near the well, and the oil properties, mainly the dynamic viscosity and the interfacial tension. Subsequently, in the production tubing, droplet break-up will occur but - due to the relatively moderate turbulent conditions - only for the less stable larger droplets, thus the smaller droplets remain unaffected2. Separating these oil droplets, varying in size from 20 ¬µm and larger, from the produced water can be easily accomplished. Hydrocyclones are for example capable of separating oil droplets efficiently with a minimum size range of 15 to 20 ¬µm in diameter3,4. Unfortunately the situation is not as simple as sketched above. In the production system a device is necessary to control the production flow-rate, viz. the choke, and this choke is placed at the surface, between the production tubing and the separation facilities. A crucial and necessary property of the choke is that it generates a pressure drop within the system. This leads to the occurrence of high energy dissipation and, consequently, to severe break-up of oil droplets, with the result that - after passing the choke - the oil-water mixture is much more difficult to separate into the two different phases than upstream of the choke because now a large amount of very small droplets is present, and these very small droplets are much harder to remove.

AB  - Abstract ¬† This study shows the utilization of the Artificial Neural Network (ANN) as a practical engineering tool for estimating the flow rate and selecting the optimal choke size. In this study, the existing choke correlations available in the literature were reviewed, evaluated and compared with the newly derived ANN. The new method can be used to predict the required choke size and can also be used to provide a quick and accurate evaluation of the well performance, by considering wellhead conditions and pressure-volume-temperature (PVT) parameters. ¬† Two models were developed based on 4,031 data points: 80% for training, 10% for validation and 10% for testing. The new models were found to outperform all the existing correlations and have provided the lowest error, with an average absolute percent error of 3.7% for the choke size prediction and 6.7% for the flow rate estimation. The new models can estimate with a higher accuracy the optimal choke size and flow rate. Therefore, the new models can help advance reservoir management and production operations in the following ways: producing the reservoir at the optimal rate; preventing water or gas coning; maintaining back pressure; and protecting formation and surface equipment from unusual pressure fluctuation. ¬† ¬† Introduction ¬† Accurate correlation for estimating multiphase flow rate is important for quick evaluation of well performance. The behaviors of oil and gas flow through chokes are of two types, critical and subcritical. Critical flow occurs when the velocity is equal or greater than the velocity of sound for this condition to exist, downstream or line pressure must be typically 55% of the tubing or upstream pressure. In critical flow the rate depends on the upstream pressure, gas-oil ratio (GOR), and choke opening only, therefore, the changes in the flow line pressure doesn't impact the flow rate. ¬† Several studies on (liquid gas) two phase flow through chokes were conducted to find the relationship between choke size, flow rate and other wellhead parameters. These theories and correlations describe two phase flow through restrictions and are used to determine the most optimum choke size or to estimate flow rate using wellhead parameters. These empirical correlations were based on a certain range of parameters involved in developing the correlation. To determine the strength and weakness of these correlations, statistical analyses are usually utilized. ¬† In recent years, neural network, which is a parallel distributed information processing model that can recognize highly complex patterns within available data, has gained popularity in petroleum applications. Many authors discussed the applications of neural network in different petroleum engineering subjects, such as pressure-volume-temperature (PVT), reservoir characterization, reservoir simulation and others. Nevertheless, none of the researchers studied the application of neural networks for two phase flow through chokes. ¬† The purpose of this study is to review theories and correlations available in the literature and to develop new Artificial Neural Network (ANN) for two phase flow through chokes, using data from several fields and reservoirs.

AB  - Summary With emphasis on deepwater wells and marginal offshore fields growing, the search for reliable subsea production systems has become a high priority. A reliable subsea adjustable choke is essential to the realization of such a system, and recent advances are producing the degree of reliability required. Technological developments have been primarily in (1) trim material (including polycrystalline diamond), (2) trim configur-ation, (3) computer programs for trim sizing, (4) component materials, and (5) diver/remote-operated-vehicle (ROV) interfaces. These five facets are overviewed and progress to date is reported. A 15- to 20-year service life for adjustable subsea chokes is now a reality. Another factor vital to efficient use of these technological developments is to involve the choke manufacturer and ROV/diver personnel in initial system conceptualization. In this manner, maximum benefit can be derived from the latest technology. Major areas of development still required and under way are listed, and the paper closes with a tabulation of successful subsea choke installations in recent years. Introduction Most large reservoirs on the Continental Shelf have been developed. This area between shore and 200-m [650-ft] water depth constitutes about 7.6% of the total ocean area. Industry experts project that subsequent discovery and production for the next several years will be directed toward marginal field development and the Continental Slope (from 200- to 3000-m [650- to 9,850-ft] water depth and about 15.3% of total ocean area). I Marginal fields and wells in these deeper waters reduce an operator's return on investment. Low prices for oil aggravate the situation. For the U.K. sector of the North Sea, some analysts state that the current economic climate makes new investment in the U.K. Continental Shelf unfavorable. In Brazil, "Evaluation results of what is believed to be the biggest onshore oil strike in the nation's history has state-owned Petrobras reconsidering expensive deepwater drilling." Subsea production systems appear to offer the most viable solution to these problems. Installation costs are much lower. Investments are returned more quickly. Existing fixed production facilities may be better utilized. For various reasons, however, many operators have avoided subsea production and opted for platform/ hybrid-platform configurations.djustable subsea production chokes have been singled out as one of the major critical components in a subsea production system. These chokes are vulnerable because they are subject to severe service and a tough environment. But they offer several advantages: use of subsea manifolds to commingle wells flowing at different pressures; the ability to bring wells on stream and to shut them down gradually to prevent formation damage; accurate flow control for the life of the reservoir in both production and water-injection applications; protection for isolation valves from damage resulting from being the primary valve across which frill pressure drop occurs; and a reduction in the number of risers and flowlines. An operator, therefore, must choose between a fixed/fixed-hybrid platform (which is expensive and depth-limited and involves long construction time) or a subsea system (which is less expensive and not depth-restricted and offers short installation time, but has questionable reliability and potentially high maintenance costs). Table 1 lists some benefits for each type of installation. Recently, the hardware and technology available in adjustable subsea chokes have steadily improved. Major developments have taken place in the interim to alter the situation significantly. The principal technological advancements are polycrystalline diamond, tungsten carbide, and stellite trim material to extend trim life in subsea use; a choice of trim configuration [plug cage, multiple orifice valve (MOV), needle and seat, multistage] to match application demands and thus to extend trim life; computer programs based on empirical flow-test data to size trim for extended service life; new selections available in the component material, such as the latest duplex stainless steels, improved coatings, and new elastomers to minimize deterioration and failures; and reduced downtime and vulnerability with maximum flexibility through diver/ ROV-retrievable packages containing parts most likely to fair or to require change-out. With all the new technology properly applied, it is now realistic to talk about 15- to 20-year service life. No longer will it be appropriate to insist on the luxury of "putting your hands on the adjustable choke. " In the current environment and with the dramatic equipment improvements, subsea production systems may represent a company's economic survival. How Have Subsea Chokes Evolved? The first subsea choke valves were topside, manually operated chokes modified with "saltwater exclusion seals" and grease-packed for pressure compensation. Valve-stem position indicators were the same as those used topside, and divers could not read them. It was not uncommon to hear horror stories of choke valves that were cut out in only minutes. And understanding the resistance to installing such a vulnerable component subsea is easy. When Shell Expro and Exxon South Cormorant underwater manifold center (UMC) was being designed and constructed, no available adjustable subsea chokes were reliable enough to be considered, so fixed-bean chokes were used instead. Now, however, retrievable subsea chokes are in final development stages that will overcome the envelope and operational restrictions of the existing system. The first major progress in improving subsea choke-valve design came about as choke manufacturers began to respond to requirements for specific installations for a single customer. The economies of design and manufacture of a standard product are obviously lost in such a process. Forced primarily by market conditions, user and supplier are now searching for common grounds and resulting cost reductions for reliable products. Maximum Cost-Effectiveness Comes From a Total System Approach As choke reliability becomes a reality for subsea production, another factor has emerged. The choke-valve manufacturer should be involved with the user from the beginning of system design. The choke is an integral part of the system that requires support from other subsystems. Proper planning provides the flexibility that operations people appreciate. It is one thing to try to fit a choke into an existing design; it is quite another to develop a system and its component parts as an integrated solution to specified operating and maintenance problems. Maximum benefits will best he achieved when user, choke manufacturer, and ROV contractor share ideas and technology during initial system conceptualization. Table 2 summarizes various factors to be considered in choke selection. SPEPE P. 301^

AB  - Performance improvement and mitigation of downhole sand plugging has resulted in minimizing the net pressure condition created within an induced-fracture network. Restricted well drawdown minimizes the physical loss of the induced stimulation, a loss which leads to downhole plugging. Using downhole chokes in liquid-unloading applications maintains high flowing sandface pressure conditions. This creates improved reservoir performance and improved well operations, and also saves costs by mitigating surface hydrate formation and fracture sand flowback.¬†

AB  - Abstract Hydrate is a major risk in all high pressure natural gas transport lines including the connecting lines and manifold systems in all offshore production facilities. Marine transportation of compressed natural gas is one example where prediction of hydrate formation in loading and unloading lines and manifold systems is a requirement for the safe transport of gas to and from ocean going ships. Production facility components such as chokes, velocity-controlled subsurface safety valves, and conventional valves and fittings can all act as restrictions to the flowing fluids, resulting in changes in flow conditions, which could lead to the formation of hydrate in the pipeline. The principal objectives of our research can be summarized as: a) to identify the location where hydrate blockage would most likely develop, b) to study the effect of parameters such as orifice geometry, gas composition, real gas behaviour, and surrounding conditions on the agglomeration spot, and c) to validate the numerical results with available experimental data. Numerical simulation using computational fluid dynamics (CFD) techniques is underway to model the mechanism of the deposition based on the most recent theories of the deposition phenomenon. The model uses CFD algorithm for assisting to configure the flow field using real gas models and predicting the actual fluid properties. The nucleation theory and driving force models and their relationships to hydrate formation are also used to predict the incipient hydrate particle size and growth rate. In this paper, the theory of the deposition mechanism is briefly discussed. The application of the theory in turbulent regime for different hydrate particle sizes is then presented. Finally the approach used for deposition process is discussed. The study concludes that two phenomenon control the deposition mechanism, namely: the Brownian diffusion mechanism by which the movement of small particles (<1¬µm) can be explained and the inertia mechanism which controls the dynamics of the relatively large particles. The collection efficiency, the indicator of the deposited particles, decreases as the size of the particles increases in the diffusion region whereas in the impaction region, the collection efficiency increases with particle size. Introduction Particle deposition is a process that plays a key role in many fields ranging from atmospheric applications to material sciences. In the oil and gas field, the accumulation of hydrate is one of the most challenging aspects in flow assurance studies. It could partially plug and eventually completely block the natural gas pipeline, causing serious risk to the safety of operating personnel and equipment as well.

AB  - Abstract The Raageshwari Deep Gas (RDG) field, situated within Barmer Basin in the State of Rajasthan, India, was discovered in 2003. The field is a tight gas condensate reservoir, with excellent gas quality of approximately 80% methane, low CO2 and no H2S. Since the permeability (0.01 - 1 md) is low in this reservoir, hydraulic fracturing is required to get substantial recovery from the wells. The field has been under production since 2010. The development of this field has been carried out in three phases and more than 150 fracturing treatments have been pumped in this reservoir till date to achieve sustained economical production. This paper deals with the lessons learnt and changes implemented in choke design through various development phases of the field. In the initial phase of field development, chokes with a low Flow Coefficient (Cv) were installed to meet the requirement of controlling the wells at low flow rates and high differential pressure. Later as the surface handling capacity increased, the chokes had to be de-bottlenecked, requiring additional Capex for new chokes. To avoid a similar scenario in the future, a comprehensive approach has been followed to envisage Cv requirement, considering well wise production profiles and surface handling capacities throughout the life of field. Since a single trim can't operate over the complete life-cycle of a well, trim interchangeability has been included in the choke design such that low and high Cv trims are interchangeable. Pre-mature failures of trims were observed in initial phase and a root cause analysis was done to ascertain the reason. Based on the analysis, trim metallurgy has been changed from Tungsten Carbide to ASTM A276 Specific Stainless Steel Grade 440C. Trims with newly selected mettalurgy have been installed in the existing chokes. The introduction of trim interchangeability has saved MMUSD 0.3 in the future Opex as the requirement of procuring altogether new chokes for late life period of wells is avoided. Initially failures in the trim bodies were observed as early as two months of commissioning but with the change in metallurgy zero failures have been observed with operational life of chokes being higher than four years. This has avoided significant downtime on wells and expenditure on regular trim changeovers. Although Tungsten Carbide is one of the most common materials used for constructing trims world over, there could be specific cases where-in other metallurgy may add better value. The workflow followed in this paper will help select a suitable metallurgy and can impart a significant value to the industry.

AB  - Abstract The surface choke has been utilized in the oil industry to control withdrawal rates per well and to optimize production especially after water breakthrough. However, as found out from this study, applying undue restrictions in horizontal wellbores intersecting high permeability features can have an adverse impact on well performance and unnecessarily lock oil potential. This paper investigates the effect of surface choke on water cut and flow contribution along horizontal wellbores that encountered natural fractures and high permeability streaks (Super-Ks). The study considered different down-hole completions; open-hole and cased-hole. The investigation was carried out using Multi Phase Flow Meter (MPFM) measurements at different choke sizes in addition to production logs (FSI), wellbore simulation modeling, and real-time data. Instant data monitoring was instrumental in insuring stabilization of sub-surface static pressure while performing many rate tests at different choke sizes. Moreover, it flagged the role of rate stabilization on water cut behavior and rate data quality. The presence of conductive fractures and Super-Ks substantially influences the flow profile and water cut of horizontal wellbores. These features create high permeability conduits along wellbores such that they dominate production and may cause some matrix sections to contribute little or nothing as observed on FSI profiles. The effect of fractures on production from less permeable sections in the wellbore was investigated at different operating rates using horizontal wellbore simulation modeling. Both MPFM measurements and FSI logs showed that water cut from horizontal wells, affected by fractures and/or Super-Ks, can decrease if they're flowed at higher rates. Upon reviewing and analyzing data from numerous FSI logs, the study has been able to relate the water cut and surface choking to the well productivity index (PI). Consistently, wells with PI more than twice the averaged matrix PI were found to always perform better at bigger choke sizes. By choke relaxation, the water cut decreased by up to 22% while increasing oil production. Wellbore modeling also suggested that the influence of a fracture on flow contribution from remaining sections in the wellbore can be minimized if the well is operated at higher rates. Restrictive surface chokes were found to disproportionately affect lower permeability sections compared to conductive fractures or Super-Ks which in most cases were invaded by water after water breakthrough. Relaxing these surface chokes allowed more contribution of dry oil from the lower permeability sections, hence the increase in overall oil production and drop in water cut in the affected wells.

AB  - Abstract Automatic and remote operated drilling chokes have been in the petroleum industry for a very long time. Managed Pressure Drilling (MPD) operations have been using these chokes since ¬±2006 and prior to that Underbalanced Drilling (UBD) operation have been using them for decades. The main control or actuation of these drilling chokes is achieved by adapting standard API-16C hydraulic or electric actuated worm gear drive actuators. These methods of actuation however have limitations related to ‚ÄòResponse Time‚Äô and ‚ÄòEquipment Failure', making these actuators less desirable for MPD applications. An advanced method of actuation using ‚ÄòElectro Servo Actuator‚Äô is presented as an alternative to alleviate these challenges. These electro servo actuators are designed from the outset considering the requirements of MPD Choke operations, and are optimized to provide precise control of chokes along with a reduction in the number of potential failure points. During extensive laboratory testing, required as a quality standard for our MPD choke's factory acceptance program, these actuators provided very accurate and responsive pressure control to quick changes in pressure demands based on variations in both set point and flow. Furthermore, the initial field testing of the actuator in the MPD field operations demonstrated the same precise and accurate pressure control tracking, along with better performance at ‚Äòlower flowrates‚Äô when compared to worm gear driven chokes. Full-scale field application on over 20 different projects across North America, including a wide range of severe weather conditions, exceeded the expectations and results from initial testing. In conclusion, the use of this new ‚ÄòElectro Servo Actuator‚Äô technology greatly increases the precise control of drilling chokes very crucial for all MPD applications. This technology reduces the potential failure points in the actuators. It enhances the uptime of the actuator and its life cycle, thereby minimizing the need for routine maintenance. Its smaller size and design enables development of more compact MPD chokes and equipment.

AB  - AbstractMany operators implement a conservative approach to sand management implementing a "Zero Sand Production" or "Maximum Sand Free Rate" Criteria. This is due to the potentially severe consequences associated with sand production i.e. erosion, and the fact that existing standards and guidelines /1/ do not provide sufficient practical advice on how to manage erosion issues during operations. These criteria generally put restrictions on the production rate (and revenue) to reduce sand production and decrease the risk of erosion leading to a loss of containment. These restrictions are in many cases unnecessary.This paper describes the development of an alternative approach which improves the production and safety performance of fields that are capacity restrained due to sand problems. The development of the approach started with a project for Conoco 1996 - 2000 /2/ and was further refined on a pilot project for Statoil in 2001 /3/, where it received the Statoil prize for the most successful R&D project in 2001.From an erosion perspective the amount of sand produced is only one of many factors that must be managed; equally important factors are sand particle velocity, impact angle and material grading. By gaining a better understanding of the specific erosion characteristics of a field through: well sand risk ranking, identification of erosion critical components and detailed erosion assessment including 3D computer modeling; a more sophisticated erosion management strategy can be implemented identifying specific asset operational criteria, erosion monitoring and inspection requirements.Implementation of this erosion management approach has provided operators with enhanced production, reduced inspection and maintenance costs without compromising safety and environmental targets and increasing/enhancing business performance.IntroductionThe mid / late 1990's saw a significant increase in unplanned hydrocarbon releases for Conoco in one of their UK North Sea operations. The releases occurred on manned installations and unmanned satellite installations with significant business and safety impact. The root cause of all incidents was an increase of solids production leading to accelerated erosion, see figure 1 for typical damage. The implemented solution of a revised Solids Management Strategy, the Maximum Allowable Solids Rate approach, has led to increased production, reductions in operating costs and enhanced safety performance.ChallengesThe key challenges in the implementation of the revised strategy can be broadly summarised as follows:Resistance to ChangeOperations personnel had over a long period of time assumed that adoption of a ‚Äòsolids free' production would minimise failures. In reality the measures adopted to achieve this aim led to an escalation in the number and severity of unplanned failures. A key challenge was education and confidence building amongst the workforce to achieve a ‚Äòsea change' in the mind set and an improved understanding of the key issues.Regulatory PressureThe failures focussed regulatory attention due to their hazardous nature and the implication this resulted from ineffective management. A key challenge was addressing this pressure which, with further incident, may have resulted in enforcement action with associated loss of revenue and reputation.

AB  - Summary "Real time?? is the new buzz in the upstream petroleum industry. So far, operators at the lease location have been the main users of real-time data measured at second or minute increments to manage wells and keep them on production. Engineers usually see only a subset of the data‚Äîthe daily production volumes and rates, along with a few selected gauge-pressure and temperature readings. The engineers' access to limited data means that they typically see only the result‚Äîthe production volumes‚Äîand not the high-frequency data that may be the reason for a certain production parameter (e.g., choke size, pressures, and temperatures). Supervisory control and data acquisition (SCADA) is the system that connects to the production facilities' controllers and data sources and collects the measured data and stores them in a database. Operators on the platform have direct access to these data and use this information to control the wells and the process equipment. If the engineers see these data at all, they usually get them through a Web-browser interface and in a format they cannot directly use for their analysis. This paper will introduce a new concept of integrating high-frequency real-time data to the oil company's business office, making those data available to engineering staff and operations management, including up to the senior management level. Each level of the organization sees as much of the high-frequency data as it needs or wants to see. The engineers and management have exactly the same view as the operators at the platform and at the same time. This might seem to be a problem at first, but in the long term, it is an empowerment of the operators and brings engineers and operators closer together by working as a team to manage the wells. The data also allow management to monitor the oil and gas production leaving the platform to see if the target business plan volumes are reached or if a well is shut in. This paper will give insights on how the access to high-frequency data changed the way of doing the daily work and how it changed the way operators work together with engineers.¬†(Note: All values in the figures within this paper are manipulated and do not necessarily represent reality). Introduction Horizontal wells and 4D seismic have been the last major technological advances that the upstream petroleum industry. Now, it appears as the so-called "intelligent field?? (also named Smart Field, e-Field, and i-Field) will be the next major technological advance in the industry. But how is an intelligent field defined? Phrases such as "closed loop?? and "self-controlled?? can be read in different publications. This is not what we will focus on in this paper, because closed-loop control still has a long way to go before it becomes reality. We will focus on the basics for an intelligent field, starting with the following questions: 1. What are the main problems? 2.What has to be done on the data-management side? 3.How can high-frequency data add value to the asset-management process? As the water depth of newly discovered reservoirs is getting deeper and deeper, the costs of drilling a well have sharply increased. A deepwater well can typically cost U.S. $15 to $50 million. The facility to support these wells may cost an additional U.S. $200 to $1,000 million. These costs have necessitated a higher level of well-performance monitoring to protect these investments. The wells and the platform are equipped with a variety of different sensors, measuring the performance of the wells and the platform's process trains with seconds-to-minute increments.

AB  - This paper was prepared for the 44th Annual Fall Meeting of the of the Society of Petroleum Engineers of AIME, to be held in Denver, Colo., Sept. 28-Oct. 1, 1969. Permission to copy is restricted to an abstract of not more than 300 words. Illustrations may not be copied. The abstract should contain conspicuous acknowledgment of where and by whom the paper is presented. Publication elsewhere after publication in the JOURNAL OF PETROLEUM TECHNOLOGY or the SOCIETY OF PETROLEUM ENGINEERS JOURNAL is usually granted upon request to the Editor of the appropriate journal, provided agreement to give proper credit is made. Discussion of this paper is invited. Three copies of any discussion should be sent to the Society of Petroleum Engineers office. Such discussion may be presented at the above meeting and, with the paper, may be considered for publication in one of the two SPE magazines. Abstract Experimental field tests were conducted to study the multiphase flow of gas and liquid [gas-water system] through a small-sized choke in a vertical position. The resulting flow patterns were photographed through patterns were photographed through transparent nipples placed immediately upstream and downstream from the choke. A correlation relating flow rates [gas and water], upstream pressures, gas-liquid ratios and orifice sizes was derived from the experimental data and is presented in this paper. The correlation has a limited range paper. The correlation has a limited range of application and is valid for critical flow conditions. It should be useful for choke sizing for both downhole and surface systems. Introduction Multiphase flow of gas and liquid occurs frequently in the petroleum, chemical and related industries. In the petroleum industry gas-liquid mixtures are transported through vertical and horizontal pipes from the reservoir to the wellhead, from the wellhead to the gas-liquid separator and to the stock tank. The refinery receives the mixture which undergoes further traveling from distillation and separating units to final storage. During both vertical and horizontal flow the well production may encounter restrictions in the form of valves, pipe size reductions and/or purposely placed orifices or chokes. The latter restrictions are placed at the wellhead or at the bottom of the well with the object either to measure the flow rate or to control the flow rate by imposing a backpressure on the formation. The choke or orifice can be used to predict the resulting upstream pressure associated with the new desired flow rate or a correct choke size may be selected for a particular flow rate. This assumes, of course, that a suitable correlation is available. The use of chokes in dual installations allows the production of two zones at bottom through one string of tubing. The two zones are commingled at the bottom through a dual flow choke. This procedure eliminates the need of producing two zones through two separate strings. A very significant consideration is that the correct size of choke to be used to allow the required flow rate from each zone must be accurately known. under this premise the various regulatory bodies permit dual installations to be produced permit dual installations to be produced through one string of tubing.

AB  - ABSTRACTMany planned new developments in the North Sea will involve the exploitation of hostile high pressure, high temperature gas condensate reserves. The extremely high pressure letdown over the wellhead choke leads to very high flow velocities, and consequent risks of erosion damage occurring to the choke internals. In a recent study, measurements of erosion have been performed during an offshore well test under flowing conditions using advanced Thin Layer Activation techniques and scaled Laboratory tests.INTRODUCTIONMany planned new developments in the the North Sea will involve the exploitation of hostile high pressure, high temperature gas condensate reserves. The economics of these prospects dictate that very high flowrates will be encountered in producers. Combined with this, the extremely high pressure letdown over the production choke will ensure high flow velocities, and consequent risks of erosion dainage occurring to the choke internals. In addition, the frequent presence of hydrogen sulphide and carbon dioxide add a significant corrosion risk and additional mechanism for material removal.

AB  - AbstractThe main purpose of this paper is to show the importance of chokes in thesimulation of surface facilities and reservoirs as integrated systems. In orderto predict producing rates accurately, it is necessary not only to model thefluid flow in the reservoir but also to couple the gathering system to thereservoir. The interaction between these two parts can have a great influencein the performance of the whole system and this interaction is greatly affectedby the use of chokes in surface facilities. Existing choke models are evaluatedand the effect of placing chokes in the surface model is studied and someresults are presented. Techniques for simultaneous simulation of reservoir,well and surface facilities will be presented in a future paper.IntroductionThe main reason for having a choke in the system is to control flow rateand, consequently, produce at the most efficient rate, prevent gas and waterconning, avoid formation damage, prevent excessive sand production and protectequipment from pressure fluctuations.The choke is a very important unit of production facilities because asignificant part of the total pressure drop can occur in the choke. A choke candecouple the reservoir or a particular reservoir domain from the productionfacilities, thus changing the characteristics of the entire system.Because surface chokes have the function of controlling rates, many authorshave stated that they should be sized to operate under critical flow. Criticalflow occurs when the velocity of the fluid reaches the sonic velocity. At thispoint, variations in the downstream side of the choke cannot be felt upstreamand, therefore, as shown in Fig. 1, there is no rate variation, even if thedownstream pressure decreases. This rate is called the critical rate and it isfunction only of the upstream parameters.

AB  - Abstract This paper shows the importance of Artificial Intelligence (AI) techniques as a practical engineering tool for predicting and estimating the gas flow rate through chokes. Studying the single gas flow through wellhead chokes is vital to the oil industry, not only to ensure the accurate estimation of gas flow rate but also to keep equipments protected from damage due to high gas flow rate. It also has the potential to avoid sand problems. Many studies have investigated the predictability of gas flow through chokes. In this paper, we reviewed, evaluated and compared the predictive performance of the available choke correlations in literature with five AI techniques. 162 data points were used to develop five AI models for predicting the gas flow rate. The data were fed to the five AI techniques Artificial Neural Network (ANN), Fuzzy Logic (FL), Support Vector Machine (SVM), Functional Network (FN) and Decision Tree (DT) (ANN, FL, SVM, FN and DT) and the results were optimized for each technique. The new models were found to perform better than the correlation and give the lowest error, with a mean absolute percentage error of 0.83%. Because of these reduced errors, the proposed AI-based models can improve gas flow rate prediction through chokes. The results of this paper will provide a better alternative to predictive modeling of petroleum reservoir properties. It will also open windows of opportunity for researchers and engineers to explore advanced machine learning techniques such as hybrids and ensembles for continued improvement of petroleum exploration and production. Introduction Artificial Intelligence (AI) techniques have been effectively and successfully applied in Petroleum Engineering. Although some engineers and researchers refer to them as ‚Äúblack box‚Äù, however a number of attempts have been made to demystify them. Mohaghegh and Ameri (1995) and Mohaghegh (2000) wrote that ‚Äújust because they are not immediately visible does not mean one cannot examine what goes in those layers‚Äù and they suggested calling it ‚Äútransparent box‚Äù instead of ‚Äúblack box‚Äù. Anifowose (2011) presented a succinct review of the application of AI techniques in Petroleum Engineering and argued that they should be seen as "white box". In additional to all these, studies carried out for over three decades have continued to prove the efficiency and effectiveness of AI techniques in Petroleum Engineering applications.

AB  - AbstractFor oil production under high water cut conditions the efforts needed for de-oiling of the production water are mainly determined by the oil-droplet-size distribution of this water. This distribution is predominantly the result of droplet breakup in the choke valve. To determine the effect of the choke valve on the droplet-size distribution, we have conducted laboratory experiments in which we used a circular orifice in a circular pipe. With the help of theory on droplet break-up in turbulent flow and with knowledge of the flow field inside an orifice, a prediction of the distribution after break-up can be made. It is shown that the droplets increase in size with increasing oil viscosity and furthermore it appears that, for the description of the break-up process, the distribution of the turbulence over the orifice zone is an important factor.P. 525

Abstract It is possible to find in the literature, some papers concerning the two phase flow through the wellhead chokes, but nearly all these contributions concern only the critical flow. The critical flow, when only the gas is concerned, happens around a choke downstream - upstream pressure ratio of about 0,5, but this condition is no more valid as the flow is two phase (gas and liquid). The velocity of a two phase flow, both critical and subcritical, is greatly depending from the gas concentration in respect to the mixture, and the downstream - upstream pressure ratio can be also lower than 0.225. pressure ratio can be also lower than 0.225. The practical cases, as experienced during several years, are nearly all in the subcritical flow field, and in the present paper, a simple formula is given for calculating the rates through the wellhead chokes, covering both the critical and subcritical flow fields. The equation below reported, can be easily also developed through a computer program. In the text, the number between square brackets, refer to the literature, and the numbers between round brackets, refer to the equations. This paper is mainly intended for practical purposes, some unavoidable calculation developments were confined in the Appendixes. A full relief was given to the illustrative numerical examples and through all the paper the metric system of units is used. Introduction Since recently two phase flow is receiving more and more attention by the researchers working in the oil industry. It can be said that no one month passes without appearing in the literature, scattered over the world, a contribution concerning this item. The impulse to these researches came from the observation that the pressure drop through a pipe, when flowing a gas/oil mixture, can be also ten times more than that due to a single phase flow. Two phase flow is characterized by two functions, and , which are defined as: (1) Where: Fg = cross section area of the choke passage occupied by the gas phase - m2; Ft = Total cross section area of the choke passage-m2; qg = Gas rate at P2 and T = qog x B g -; m3/sec; qog = Gas rate at standard conditions Po and To - m3/sec; ql = liquid rate = q B at p and T-m3/sec; q = liquid rate at standard conditions Po and To - m3/sec. The multiphase flow can be as these patterns; - Dispersed flow; - Annular flow; - Wave flow; - Slug flow; - Plug flow; - Stratified flow; - Bubble flow; Generally the gas, when flowing with liquid (for ex. oil) through a pipe, slips over the liquid and, due to this condition and have different values, as shown on fig. 1, for the frequent case of plug flow (17).

AB  - Abstract This paper describes the results obtained and the equipment and techniques used in setting up the first barge-assisted hydraulic workover operation in the Gulf of Thailand (GOT). This paper will discuss the hydraulic workover unit (HWU) selected to perform the operations along with the engineering modifications that were required to meet the operator's requirements in the GOT, primarily installing electrical submersible pump (ESP) completions in depleting wells. The paper includes descriptions of the challenges faced in operating an HWU on minimum facility production installations (MFPI) with total platform weight limitations of 40 mT and minimal crane capacity. Also discussed are a number of innovations designed and built into the HWU to enable a safe, quick assembly using a barge crane and remote power and fluid systems to make the HWU system as flexible as possible to cover all known deviations from the standard scope of work. Lessons learned from the operations are also presented to demonstrate the ongoing operational challenges, the solutions implemented, and the results achieved. Introduction During 2005, an operator conducted a four-well pilot ESP workover campaign using a jack-up (JU) rig in the GOT. Due to the formations in the GOT being highly compartmentalized, braided fluvial sand environments, typical oil wells there were producing 40 to 60% water-cut, giving an average pipeline pressure of 350 to 600 psi. As such, the natural gas lift diminished as the source of high pressure depleted. Through this successful pilot scheme, it was recognized that the economics for using a drilling rig to install the ESP completions would not be favorable unless an alternative and less expensive installation method could be found. The candidate ESP wells were to be completed as 2 7/8-in. monobore completions within 7-in. casing with the packer to be set above the existing tubing at the top of cement (TOC) in the 7-in. casing. This would result in the ESP being set 2,000 to 3,700 ft true vertical depth (TVD) above the top perforations at a depth of ~6,500 ft. This meant that the expected pickup weight of the tubing was 70,000 lb and, as such, a rig with a minimum 150,000-lb lift capacity would be required to run the completion. Key drivers in this alternative solution were: The customer to deliver high volumes of new wells to meet gas delivery commitments. Utilization of the available JU drilling rigs to drill and complete new wells. The significant increase in JU rig rates in the GOT. Candidate wells were located on MFPI in the GOT with an average size of 180 m2. Deck load capacity of MPFIs limited to 40 mT total. Existing platform crane capacity ¬±5 tons. Platforms located 150 miles offshore in 250 ft of water.

AB  - ABSTRACT This paper aims to study the application of choke models as a part of virtual metering system (VMS) to predict the flow rate of natural gas wells. In this paper, three semi-empirical choke models, including Perkins, Sachdeva and Al-Safran, are investigated. Combining with the 12424 groups actual production data obtained by flowmeters of A1 and A2 wells in the underwater gas field in the South China Sea, the flow coefficients are defined to modify those models. The results show great agreement with field production data and the results of wellbore model (a calculation module of the VMS). In addition, Perkins model of which the average error is 8.23% and the standard deviation is 5.48% is more accurate relative to Sachdeva and Al-Safran model. Considering the error of flowmeter and the fluctuation of production data, those choke models can be developed as a part of VMS to predict natural gas flow rate. INTRODUCTION With the further development of the oil and gas industry moving to the seas continuously, underwater oil and gas production process have been born. Achieving continuous measurement of oil and gas wells is one of the most basic technical requirements during its producing processes. The harsh natural environment in the deep sea makes it difficult for the flowmeter to be installed and it costs a fortune to maintain (Varyan et al., 2015). As the alternative, a relatively new single well metering management software, virtual metering system (VMS), has been gradually adopted in the domestic and foreign offshore oil and gas field production systems (Bello et al., 2014). The flow rate of oil and gas in the single well can be calculated out through several different kinds of modules with VMS technology utilizing the field basic process parameters and the real-time instrumental data obtained from the Data Communication System (DCS). VMS technology is highly integrated, which provides great convenience for the operators. In contrast to traditional techniques, VMS is more convenient in operation as its highly integration, cheaper for installation and maintenance (Paz et al., 2010), (Petukhov et al., 2011). Another advantage of VMS is that it can be employed in combination with real-time flow management system. Hence, VMS can be used as a replacement of traditional multiphase metering equipment or as a supplementary or backup scheme of an entity flowmeter in an offshore gas field (Wu et al., 2015a). Some technology companies in this area have developed a variety of corresponding systems which were successfully used and achieved good results in some deep-water oil and gas fields in North Sea, Mexico Bay and West Africa, such as the FAS system of FMC company, OLGA online system of SPT company, ISIS system of BP, WPM system of TOTAL (Wang et al., 2015). The research in this area has just begun in China. Our group is researching and developing a flow monitoring and management system relying on multiphase flow simulation technology. In January 2014, this system based on wellbore model was successfully put into use in a certain gas field in the South China Sea (Wu et al., 2015b) (Wang et al., 2014). After nearly three years of operation, it turned out that the VMS system has been running smoothly and the hardware malfunctions never happened. The individual flow and total flow calculated by VMS are in good agreement with the measurement results of the flowmeter on the platform. Our VMS meets the accuracy requirements of engineering practical production, thus creating considerable economic benefits and value (Wang et al., 2013).

AB  - Abstract Multi-stage restriction orifices are being increasingly used for Oil & Gas facilities depressurization instead of single stage orifices in order to overcome noise and vibration constraints. These are typically in the range of 0.5 to 3.0 m long considering 6-10 stages used particularly for high pressure depressurization system. However, in reality Multistage Orifices impose layout constraints in offshore installations and especially for congested brownfield modifications. Multi-stage orifices are used in Gas and liquid service where large pressure drop is required to avoid choke flow condition and cavitation respectively. Multistage orifices help to eliminate noise, vibration in piping due to cavitation and choked flow. During depressurization of hydrocarbon inventory, the flow through the restriction orifice is inherently in choked condition, thus restrict the relieving rate allowing optimized vent/flare system design. Noise and vibration resulting from choked flow conditions can be addressed by piping design or selecting single stage multibore restriction orifice and thereby eliminating the use of a multistage restriction Orifice for depressurization. Multi-stage restriction orifices are recommended by suppliers wherever pressure drop is exceeding the choked pressure ratio, which is usually the case in facilities depressurization. The number of orifice stages is selected for limiting pressure drop at each stage below the choked pressure ratio. However, multistage restriction orifices application in depressurization service imposes various challenges such as potential blockage in any of the stages due to hydrate formation and draining of residual fluid from the assembly considering its complex geometry. These challenges get aggravated especially for brownfield modifications wherein single stage orifices are replaced with relatively long multistage orifices in existing congested facilities. Single stage orifices fulfill the requirement of depressurization provided piping design addresses the noise and vibration. Even these requirements can be relaxed by considering intermittent nature of the operation and actual operating experience. NPCC‚Äôs experience in many onshore/offshore oil and gas projects suggests that complex designs can be simplified based on better understanding of functional requirements of depressurization in consultation with suppliers. This paper discusses the constraints of installing multi-stage orifices in offshore installations based on examples from recent EPC projects and proposes to adopt simplified, safe and cost effective design. The paper also highlights benefits of conventional single stage orifices for depressurization service.

AB  - AbstractSachdeva's choke flow model has been found capable of predicting critical-subcritical boundary and liquid and gas flow rates for multiphase crude systems. Although this model was shown to be accurate by Sachdeva et al.(15) in their original paper using laboratory and field data, inaccuracy of the model has been found in other field applications. In this study, the accuracy of the choke model was evaluated using data from 239 oil wells and 273 gas condensate wells in Southwest Louisiana. Comparisons of results from measurements and model calculations indicate that the model is more accurate for oil wells than for gas condensate wells. It was found that the error of the model could be minimized using different values of choke discharge coefficient (CD). For oil wells, CD = 1.08 should be used for liquid rate prediction and CD = 0.78 should be used for gas rate predictions. For gas condensate wells, CD = 1.07 should be used for gas rate predictions and CD = 1.53 should be used for liquid rate predictions.IntroductionWellhead chokes are equipment used in the oil and gas industry to control fluid production rates from wells, to maintain stable pressure downstream from the choke and to provide the necessary backpressure to a reservoir to avoid formation damage from excessive drawdown. Because oil and gas production rates are extremely sensitive to choke size, accurate modeling of choke performance is vitally important for petroleum engineers in oil production simulation.Tangren et al.(1) performed the first investigation on gas-liquid two-phase flow through restrictions. They presented an analysis of the behaviour of an expanding gas-liquid system. They showed that when gas bubbles are added to an incompressible fluid above a critical flow velocity, the medium becomes incapable of transmitting a pressure change upstream against the flow. Several empirical choke flow models have been developed in the past half century. They generally take the following form for sonic flow:Equation (1) (Available in full paper)where:Pwh = upstream (wellhead) pressure, kPaQ = gross liquid rate, m3/dayR = gas-liquid ratio, scm/m3S = choke size, cm and C, m and n are empirical constants related to fluid properties. On the basis of the production data from Ten Section Field in Cal-ifornia, Gilbert(2) found the values for C, m and n to be 2.4644, 0.546 and 1.89, respectively. Other values for the constants were proposed by different researchers including Baxendell(3), Ros(4) and Achong(5). Poettmann and Beck(6) extended the work of Ros to develop charts for different API crude oils. Omana et al.(7) derived dimensionless choke correlations for water-gas systems.Fortunati(8) was the first investigator who presented a model that can be used to calculate critical and subcritical two-phase flow through chokes. Ashford(9) also developed a relation for two-phase critical flow based on the work of Ros. Gould(10) plotted the critical-subcritical boundary defined by Ashford, showing that different values of the polytropic exponents yield different boundaries. Ashford and Pierce(11) derived an equation to predict the critical pressure ratio.

AB  - ABSTRACTSun was faced with the challenge of commercially developing Balmoral, a small reservoir located in a water depth of 460 ft on Block 16/21a of the UK sector in the North Sea. All options were examined and Sun finally chose a subsea development with a Floating Production Vessel located over a central template. The success of this method of development could lead the way to the development of other marginal fields in the North Sea and in many other parts of the world. It could also lead to a more cost effective way to develop reservoirs in much deeper waters. INTRODUCTIONThe Balmoral Field is situated 140 miles off the North East coast of Scotland in Block 16/21a. The Balmoral group with North Sea Sun Oil (NSSO) as operator discovered the field in 1975. Seven years later in 1982 the decision to develop the field was taken. Crude oil was to be collected from 13 subsea production wells and processed on the world's first purpose built Floating Production Vessel before being exported through a 14" diameter pipeline to the Brae/Forties pipeline and then onto the Cruden Bay receiving station in Scotland. INITIAL STUDIESKnowing that this was a marginal development NSSO was faced with the cha11enge of exactly what type of cost effective facilities should be used. Reservoir management had indicated that the maximum recoverable reserves were 67.5MMSTB of oil with a gravity of 39.90¬∞ API and a GOR of 366 SCF/STB with no significant sulphur or CO2 It was expected to produce at a peak production rate of 35,000 BOPD for approximately three years before commencing its decline. Oil recovery would be improved by maintaining reservoir pressure with water injection and by introducing gas lift in the production wells to sustain flowing capacities. Gas re-injection wou1d not be possible. Additiona1 allowances would have to be made for other prospective reservoirs close by. A study was carried out to compare the costs of a platform versus a floating system based on recoverab1e reserves of 50, 65 and 100 MMBBLS for a floater and 65,80,100,120 and 150 MMBBLS for a platform. The study's conclusions were that for the equivalent recoverable reserves a platform was 40% more costly than a floater. PRODUCTION FACILITIESThe "Basis of Design" stated that the process system must be designed for the following (Information available in full paper) The produced fluids were to be directed via a riser system from the subsea template to the process facilities on the FPV. On-board manifolding was to be provided to allow strong or weak wells to be directed to the first or second stage separator. In addition to gas lift, gas was also to be used for power generation with the remainder being flared as there was no existing gas export 1ine adjacent to Balmoral and a newline was not justifiable for the quantity of gas available.

AB  - Abstract Multiphase flow occurs in almost all producing oil and gas/condensate wells .Wellhead chokes are special equipment that widely used in the petroleum industry to control flow rate, to maintain well allowable, to protect surface equipments, to prevent water and gas coning and to provide the necessary backpressure to reservoir to avoid formation damage from excessive drawdown. Accurate modeling of choke performance and selection of optimum choke size is vitally important for a petroleum engineer in production from reservoirs due to high sensitivity of oil and gas production to choke size. Two main approaches have been proposed for prediction of multiphase flow through chokes can be classified as either analytical or empirical and majority of correlations were developed for critical flow conditions. Although most of the correlations available to petroleum engineers are for critical flow but in lots of high rate gas/condensate wells subcritical flow occurs in large choke sizes.There is no empirical correlation for wellhead choke performance under subcritical condition for high rate gas condensate wells, especially in large choke sizes. The first aim of this paper is to develop a new simple empirical Gilbert type correlation for high rate gas condensate wells under subcritical flow in large choke sizes (40/64 in. to 192/64 in.) using non-linear regression analysis based on 61 field data points of 15 wells from ten different fields. The second is to extend the work of Al-Attar for high rate gas condensate wells flowing through large choke size under subcritical flow conditions and check the applicability and advantages.Finally, statistical comparison between these two approaches is done with different error parameters. 1. Introduction Multiphase flow occurs in almost all producing oil and gas/condensate wells. Every flowing well has some devices to control the flow rate for maintaining sufficient back pressure to prevent formation damage, to protect surface equipments, to prevent water/gas coning, to stabilize the flow rate and to produce the reservoir at the most efficient possible rate. Thus chokes are one of the most important flow controllers in oil and gas producing wells. Accurate modeling of choke performance and selection of optimum choke size is vitally important for a petroleum engineer in production from reservoirs due to high sensitivity of oil and gas production to choke size. Flow through a surface choke can be described as either critical or sub-critical. Critical flow occurs when the velocity through the choke is greater than the sonic velocity of the fluid. This results in a Mach number of the fluid that is greater than or equal to one. For fluids with a velocity greater than sonic velocity, any downstream perturbation is unable to propagate upstream and the mass flow rate through the choke is solely a function of the upstream parameters, in other words, in a critical flow region, the mass flow rate reaches a maximum value that is independent of a pressure drop applied across the choke. Therefore, once critical flow is reached, any disturbance introduced downstream of the choke will have no effect on upstream conditions. Conversely, in sub-critical flow, the flow rate depends on pressure difference across the choke and changes in the downstream pressure affect the upstream pressure. Two main approaches have been proposed for prediction of multiphase flow through chokes can be classified as either analytical or empirical.The first investigation on gas-liquid two-phase flow through restrictions was performed by Tangren (1949). He presented an analysis of the behavior of an expanding gas-liquid system showing when gas bubbles are added to an incompressible fluid, above a critical flow velocity, the medium becomes incapable of transmitting pressure change upstream against the flow.

AB  - Introduction Precipitation of solids, generically called Precipitation of solids, generically called "paraffins," is a well-recognized production problem. The severity and nature of the production problem. The severity and nature of the problem can be predicted by use of accurate problem can be predicted by use of accurate composition of the C7+ fraction and principles of solution thermodynamics. principles of solution thermodynamics. Paraffin problems commonly result from cooling and subsequent precipitation of highmolecular-weight hydrocarbons during Iransit from the reservoir to the surface, Paraffin deposits form on the wall of downhole tubulars and in low-velocity zones near entrances and exits of chokes, collars, or similar restrictions in the flow path. Costly preventive chemical treatments or remedial preventive chemical treatments or remedial workover procedures are required to cut away the paraffin deposit with mechanical knives or scrapers, As an alternative, hot oil can be used to melt these deposits. Even more significant, but generally unaddressed, is the problem of backpressure on the reservoir caused by paraffin deposits, in the production tubing, which decreases the fluid withdrawal rate and defers production. Heavy hydrocarbons can also production. Heavy hydrocarbons can also precipitate within the reservoir, reducing the precipitate within the reservoir, reducing the permeability at distances that are permeability at distances that are untreatable from the wellbore, thereby posing a large production restriction. production restriction. Precipitation of solid paraffin is actually an example of fluid/solid phase equilibrium. It is explained in terms of established principles of thermodynamics of solutions-i.e., principles of thermodynamics of solutions-i.e., the solution of higher-molecular-weight hydrocarbons in lower-molecular-weight hydrocarbons that act as a solvent. Simply put, high-molecular-weight solids precipitate whenever anything occurs that precipitate whenever anything occurs that decreases the carrying capacity of the fluid solvent. Three classes of problems associated with paraffin deposition in petroleum production are supercritical fluid phenomena in production are supercritical fluid phenomena in the reservoir, temperature changes in the production tubing; and pressure and production tubing; and pressure and temperature changes in surface facilities, gathering systems, and trunklines. Supercritical Solvent Effects In the Reservoir In deep, hot reservoirs, fluid have equilibrated over geologic time. The reservoir temperature typically exceeds the critical temperature of several of the light ends, such as methane and ethane, and associated nonhydrocarbon gases, such as nitrogen and CO2. These "supercritical" components are known to act as effective solvents for heavy ends. The most notable application of supercritical-solvent extraction technology is the decaffeination of coffee with CO2. Similar applications demonstrate the general affinity of supercritical fluids for macromolecular solutes. When a well begins producing hydrocarbons and associated fluids to the surface, a pressure gradient is established. resulting in pressure gradient is established. resulting in flow of reservoir fluid through the porous medium. The carrying capacity of the supercritical-solvent fraction decreases dramatically as the pressure decreases in the direction of the wellbore. Precipitation of dissolved heavy ends, in the reservoir rock, is predictable. Accumulation of precipitated heavy ends in the reservoir is precipitated heavy ends in the reservoir is a plausible contribution to relative permeability decrease with cumulative production. permeability decrease with cumulative production. Temperature Changes in Production Tubing Production Tubing Solids deposition in production tubing, the most common example of the paraffin problem observed in production, is primarily a problem observed in production, is primarily a result of decreasing temperature, which causes a certain portion of the highmolecular-weight fraction to precipitate. Mechanisms other than decreasing temperature, such as pressure change, can reduce the carrying capacity of the solvent fraction of the reservoir fluid during transit from bottomhole to the surface. Pressure change resulting in liberation of volatile light ends as gas may prove to be a very significant mechanism in terms of its impact on overall recovery of oil and gas. Pressure and Temperature Pressure and Temperature Changes in Surface Facilities and Pipelines Precipitation of paraffin in surface Precipitation of paraffin in surface equipment results from lower fluid temperature and from a decrease in fluid pressure. In separators, precipitation results from flashing and the resulting decrease in the amount of light ends that are pan of the solvent fraction. Paraffin deposition in surface equipment is a relatively minor technical problem because it is easily accessible and most of the heavier fraction has already precipitated in the wellbore and the reservoir. Nonetheless, paraffin deposition in trunklines and transmission lines exposed to severely cold climatic conditions remains an expensive aspect of getting oil to the marketplace, especially when pipelines are on the ocean floor, such as at the Beatrice field in the North Sea and the Hibernia field offshore Newfoundland, or in Arctic regions, such as the Alaskan North Slope, the Daqing and Shen-Yang fields in northern China, and fields in Siberia. Reservoir Engineering of Paraffin Fluids Today's reservoir fluid must be thought of as a complex mixture of light ends (methane, ethane, propane, butanes, pentanes, hexanes, etc.) and heavy ends (a near continuum of molecular weight fractions characterized as distributions of paraffins, naphthenes, aromatics, resins, bitumens, asphaltenes, etc.). It is not sufficient to characterize reservoir fluids simply in terms of weight percent C7+, ASTM D-86 Pour Point, and API gravity. Point, and API gravity. Reliable sampling and compositional analysis of the reservoir fluid, initially and during production, are essential. Accurate knowledge of fluid composition enables the engineer to forecast and define the severity of paraffin deposition problems associated with production. JPT P. 1024

AB  - AbstractSachdeva's choke flow model has been found capable of predicting critical-subcritical boundary and liquid and gas flow rates for multiphase crude systems. Although this model was shown to be accurate by Sachdeva et al. in their original paper using laboratory and field data, inaccuracy of the model has been found in other field applications. In this study, the accuracy of the choke model was evaluated using data from 239 oil wells and 273 gas condensate wells in Southwest Llouisiana. Comparisons of results from measurements and model calculations indicate that the model is more accurate for oil wells than for gas condensate wells. It was found that the error of the model could be minimized using different values of choke discharge coefficient (CD). For oil wells, CD = 1.08 should be used for liquid rate predictions, and CD = 0.78 should be used for gas rate predictions. For gas condensate wells, CD = 1.07 should be used for gas rate predictions, and CD = 1.53 should be used for liquid rate predictions. IntroductionWellhead chokes are equipment used in oil and gas industry to control fluid production rates from wells, to maintain stable pressure downstream from the choke, and to provide the necessary backpressure to a reservoir to avoid formation damage from excessive drawdown. Because oil and gas production rates are extremely sensitive to choke size, accurate modelling of choke performance is vitally important for petroleum engineers in oil production simulation. Tangren. 1 performed the first investigation on gasliquid two-phase flow through restrictions. He presented an analysis of the behavior of an expanding gas-liquid system. He showed that when gas bubbles are added to an incompressible fluid, above a critical flow velocity, the medium becomes incapable of transmitting pressure change upstream against the flow. Several empirical choke flow models have been developed in the past halfcentury. They generally take the following form for sonic flow: (equation (1) is available in full of paper). and C, m and n are empirical constants related to fluid properties. On the basis of the production data from Ten Section Field in California, Gilbert2 found the values for C, m and n to be 435, 0.546 and 1.89, respectively. Other values for the constants were proposed different researchers including Baxendell, 3 Ros, 4 and Achong. 5 Poettmann and Beck6 extended the work of Ros to develop charts for different API crude oils. Omana7 derived dimensionless choke correlations for water-gas systems. Fortunati8 was the first investigator who presented a model that can be used to calculate critical and subcritical two-phase flow through chokes. Ashford9 also developed a relation for two-phase critical flow based on the work of Ros. Gould10plotted the criticalsubcritical boundary defined by Ashford, showing that different values of the polytropic exponents yield different boundaries. Ashford and Pierce11 derived an equation to predict the critical pressure ratio. Their model assumes that the derivative of flow rate with respect to the downstream pressure is zero at critical conditions. One set of equations was recommended for both critical and subcritical flow conditions.

AB  - SPE Members Many oil and gas wells may be producing at rates which appear to be optimum but which actually contain unnecessary restrictions to flow. These wells can be analyzed using modelling techniques to evaluate all components of a producing well system. Often this procedure will identify possible modifications in the well which if made will result in larger flow rates. This method described is often referred to as Nodal* Analysis. All components starting at the static reservoir pressure and ending at the separator are evaluated if present. This may include inflow performance, flow across the completion, flow up the tubing string including any down-hole restrictions, safety valves, flow across the surface choke (if applicable) and flow through horizontal flow lines and into the separation facilities. The objectives of well analysis are as follows: 1. To determine the flow rate at which a well will produce with a given wellbore geometry and completion (first by natural flow). 2. To determine under what flow conditions a well will cease to produce. This can be related to time as the reservoir depletes. 3. To select the most economical time for the installation of artificial lift and to assist in the selection of the best artificial lift method. 4. To optimize the well conditions and geometry system in order to most economically produce the objective flow rate. 5. To analyze each component in the well system to determine if it is restricting the flow rate unnecessarily when compared to the flow capacities of the other system components. 6. Overall, this permits quick recognition by the operator's management and engineering staff of ways and means to increase production rates. This is a very important feature of being able to graphically display the wells performance with "production optimization" or "Nodal* Analysis Techniques." There are numerous oil and gas wells around the world that have not been optimized to achieve an objective rate in an efficient manner. In fact, many may have been routinely completed in a manner such that their maximum potential rate cannot be achieved. Also, many of the wells placed on artificial lift are not achieving the efficiency that may be possible. The production optimization of oil and gas wells using computerized well models has contributed to improved completion techniques, better efficiency, and higher production with many wells. This type of analysis was proposed in a classic paper by Gilbert in 1954, however its use has not been extensive until recent years. One principal reason for this was the changing of allowable producing rates. Another reason has been the development of computer technology allowing rapid calculation of complex algorithms and easily understood input and output. Past conservation practices in the U.S. led to the use of 2" (5.08 cm) and 2-1/2" (6.35 cm) tubing and 4 shots per foot for perforating. Larger tubing (4-1/2" (11.43 cm) and 5-1/2" (13.97 cm)) and 16 shots per foot are not uncommon today when higher rates are allowed. P. 77

AB  - AbstractA problem in mature oil fields is the large amount of water produced alongside the oil. At the moment that both phases are leaving the wellbore of an oil well, tight water-in-oil emulsions can be formed due to the turbulence in the choke-valve at the wellhead. This flow process was simulated in the laboratory, by pumping crude oil-brine mixtures through a model choke-valve represented by a calibrated orifice. The parameters varied were the water-cut, the production flow rate and the orifice dimensions. The water-in-oil emulsion droplets were encapsulated immediately after formation and the emulsion characteristics, i.e. droplet-size distributions and water fraction were determined by optical microscopy and DSC.The results of the experiments revealed that water-in-oil emulsions could be formed in the choke-valve if a certain critical value of the average energy dissipation rate was exceeded. This critical value depends on the type of crude oil and on the oil-water ratio. The diameter of the emulsion droplets found in the experiments could be explained in the framework of inertial and viscous break-up theories. In experiments with a crude oil with little asphaltenes the droplet diameters were in the order of the Kolmogorov length scale and the average diameter Dav of the emulsion droplets decreased with increasing energy dissipation rate ( following a power-law relation: Dav?en. The value of the exponent n was found to be -0.3 and -0.1 at a watercut of 30 vol.% and 50 vol.% respectively. In experiments with an asphaltenic crude oil, the final droplet diameter was determined by viscous forces, probably due to relaminarising flow conditions. This paper gives new information with respect to the characteristics of brine-in-crude-oil emulsions being formed in a model choke-valve and can be used to obtain insight in the emulsion formation problematic at the wellhead of an oil well. Additionally, the paper provides data on the size of droplets formed in turbulent and laminar flow at high dispersed-phase fraction.IntroductionA choke-valve that is positioned at the wellhead of an oil well is used to control the production flow rate and to reduce the pressure in the tubing to a value which is favourable for further processing of the produced fluids. The ‚Äòchoking' of the production flow in the choke-valve implies the conversion of a part of the kinetic energy of the flow into heat by viscous dissipation. The flow regime in the choke-valve is generally completely turbulent. The turbulence phenomenon can be regarded as a collection of a large number of rotating fluid structures (‚Äòeddies') of different dimensions. These eddies will inevitably have a mixing effect and a stable emulsion can be formed if two immiscible fluid phases are present. The stability of the formed emulsion is primary determined by the droplet diameter and the chemical components present at the droplet interface, such as asphaltenes and resins which are considered as the natural surfactants of crude oils. The break-up of oil droplets in water during flow through an orifice has been studied extensively by van der Zande1. In his experiments he has measured the droplet size of oil droplets leaving from an orifice (figure 1) as a function of pressure drop, orifice dimensions, oil viscosity and diameter of the arriving oil droplets. His experiments were performed with a mineral oil-tap water system at very low dispersed phase fraction (<1 vol.% oil), to exclude the influence of surfactants and droplet coalescence on the break-up process respectively. For low oil viscosity, the droplet diameters measured by van der Zande1 were found to be equal to the values predicted by the droplet break-up theory of Hinze2.

AB  - This article, written by Technology Editor Dennis Denney, contains highlights of paper SPE 112078, "Improving Production by Use of Autonomous Systems," by Jorn Olmheim, Einar Landre, SPE, and Eileen A. Quale, SPE, StatoilHydro, prepared for the 2008 SPE Intelligent Energy Conference and Exhibition, Amsterdam, 25-27 February. The paper has not been peer reviewed. Several companies have reported a 2 to 5% increase in oil production, and in some cases up to 10%, by use of a closer collaboration between onshore-based production-optimization groups and offshore personnel. The concepts of variable and delegated autonomy from the domain of unmanned flight were applied in StatoilHydro‚Äôs production process. Compared with traditional automation, the concepts of delegated and variable autonomy introduce negotiation between different subsystems and a more-adaptable human/machine interaction.¬†¬† Introduction The industry trend is toward increased instrumentation and the use of smart-well technology for new developments. This trend has increased information flow into the control room, presenting new challenges with respect to use of this information. Other industries have shown that increased information flow can contribute to information overload and lack of shared-situation awareness between key stakeholders. In the control room of a large installation with 100 wells and each well producing 15 different signals, 1,500 different signals must be processed at any given time. Humans are not able to process this flood of data rapidly and efficiently. An objective of integrated operations is better use of technical experts, independent of location. Therefore, shared-situation awareness between control-room operators and remote experts is a pre-requisite. Achieving the required level of situation awareness can be assisted by an increased level of computerized support that is able to analyze complex data streams and transform raw data input into events and derived recommendations for further analysis and action. Production Practices and Challenges Production planning is based on an agreed production target or profile, in accordance with the field‚Äôs drainage and injection strategy, or on a delivery-contract obligation. The individual well‚Äôs contribution at any given time will depend on the required production rate as well as other factors such as limitations on wellhead or downhole pressure, sand-production potential, equipment restraints, coning/cusping conditions, and velocity restrictions. Also, total production to a facility will be dictated by the available handling capacity for the different fluid phases and export requirements, as well as by necessary maintenance work. A facility‚Äôs production profile generally will be characterized as ‚Äúwell-limited‚Äù (well potential is the limiting factor) or ‚Äúprocess-limited‚Äù (the production facilities are the bottleneck).

AB  - Summary The most important contributor to improved oil recovery on mature fields is drilling of infill wells. Managed-pressure drilling (MPD) and continuous-circulation-system (CCS) techniques can be used for improved control of bottomhole pressure when drilling wells in depleted fields with narrow pressure windows, but rig heave is a challenge when drilling from floating drilling units. Rig heave, caused by sea waves, induces downhole pressure oscillations that could exceed the operational pressure window. These oscillations are called ‚Äúsurge and swab,‚Äù and occur during tripping in and tripping out of the borehole, as well as during drillpipe connections, while the drillstring is suspended in the slips. Downhole choking was introduced as a method to reduce downhole pressure oscillations induced by the rig heave, and the concept was tested at laboratory scale and using computer simulations (Kvernland et al. 2018). The simulations were performed using a purpose-developed software that uses such input variables as wave height, pump flow, drillpipe movements, rig characteristics, and drilling-fluid properties, along with well design, drillpipe, and bottomhole-assembly (BHA) data, to simulate downhole pressure induced by rig heave. The simulator is designed to model dynamic interactions between the drilling fluid and the drillstring in a rigorous manner, which gives it the ability to accurately predict rapid downhole changes, such as those induced by ocean waves. In this paper, we provide an overview of the surge-and-swab simulator, describing its capabilities and limitations. Data from drilling a North Sea well are then used to validate the simulations performed using the software. The well used as an example in this paper was drilled conventionally from a floating rig. The downhole pressure variations recorded during three different drillpipe connections are compared with simulated downhole pressure. The simulations are performed on the basis of the recorded rig heave as well as the actual drilling-fluid, well-design, and drillpipe data. Results show that there is a good correlation between simulated and actual measured downhole pressure. The surge-and-swab simulation software is then used to simulate the same drillpipe connections using three different techniques and combinations of techniques used for improved downhole pressure control: (1) MPD, (2) MPD combined with CCS, and (3) MPD combined with CCS and a downhole choke. Results show that rig heave-induced downhole pressure variations are reduced to a level that is considered acceptable for drilling a well with a narrow pressure window for the last two cases, whereas use of backpressure MPD alone is not sufficient. The combination of MPD and CCS reduced surge and swab for two out of three drillpipe connections. For the third and deepest connection, the surge-and-swab pressure increased. The largest reduction in significant downhole pressure variations occurs when MPD and CCS are combined with downhole choking. Future work will consist of further developing the surge-and-swab simulator so that it will be possible to use it in well planning and as real-time decision support during drilling operations. The simulator will also be developed to include the possibility of simulating various well completion operations such as running casing and liners. The next hardware development phase consists of designing and building a complete downhole tool for testing in a well.

AB  - AbstractDynamically Positioned (DP) rigs started out in Campos Basin with an exploratory drilling program in waters around 900 meters deep. After this, these vessels were used in shallow water workover and completion jobs, where conventionally moored rigs could not work due to the cluttered sea floor. Despite their success, DP rigs do present failures such as black-outs, drift-offs, and drive-offs. Any such failure can end up in a collision with a surface or subsea obstacles, of catastrophic implications. A mathematical method was established based on probabilistic statistical analysis of vessel characteristics, black-out elapsed times, and time between total power failures to determine the minimum distance that a DP rig can work from an obstacle. This method led to the so called restriction diagram. Safety alternatives were also pursued, in partnership with the contractors, for the cases when it is necessary to operate inside the restriction diagram, such as safety anchors and safety boats. Real scale experiments were performed to test the feasibility of safety anchors for a DP semi submersible working in a close proximity to an obstacle. Furthermore, restriction diagrams, DP vessel characteristics, and safety devices have helped to choose from the available rig fleet the best unit to perform certain tasks such as well completions in a cluttered area. As a result, restriction diagrams have grown to be powerful tools to use in deep water fields development using subsea flowlines.IntroductionPetrobras started its deep water drilling program using DP rigs in 1984, when the wildcat well 1 RJS 2 19 A was drilled in Campos Basin in 840 meters of water depth. 011 discoveries in waters as deep as 900 meters pushed the geological studies to deep and ultra deep waters and more DP rigs were necessary to develop a fast growing and promising exploratory drilling program. The success of DP rigs also pushed its use to shallow water workover jobs, where conventionally moored rigs could not work due to the cluttered sea-floor. Increasingly deeper water subsea completions naturally followed the discoveries. Between 1984 and December 1992, almost 8,000 days of DP operations were logged in drilling, workover, and completions operations. Moreover, for the incoming years a greater number of DP rigs would be necessary to meet the exploratory and development programs almost entirely held in Campos Basin (Figure 1). This increasing activity of DP rigs, led Petrobras to create in 1992 the Dynamic Positioning Safety Program(1) (DPPS) which is a partnership program with the DP rigs contractors to minimize the risk of station keeping failure to avoid its catastrophic consequences. Among the initial DPPS projects, there was one entitled "Risk Equivalence" that aimed to answer questions like: how safe is a DP rig when working in close proximity to another DP rig, a moored rig, or production unit? Which is the most adequate DP rig to perform certain tasks? What minimal distance a DP unit should maintain from surrounding obstacles to avoid collisions? These questions came from the the initial DP experience in Campos Basin, where 53 emergency disconnections were observed from 1984 to 1992.

AB  - Abstract The control line for CZ-5 well became plugged due to contaminants in the hydraulic control line fluid. As a result, CZ-5 well remained shut in with the deferment of 2000 bbls/day. Remedial solution was planned and it involved the installation of subsurface controlled safety valve or storm choke. Since the failed subsurface safety valve is in the jammed close position, the mechanism to lock open the flapper and to keep the valve open permanently must be done before the installion of the storm choke. The special tubing with smaller ID, or better known as straddle, was then set across the flapper and hang inside. Without the realization that the pressure setting of the storm choke calculation would become complicated with the smaller tubing/straddle inside, the closing and opening pressure were determined based on NODAL Analysis. The flapper of CZ-5 ScSSV was also expected to dislocate severely and a special flip open tool is designed to position the dislocated flapper back to its housing. Flapper flip open tool is the in-house designed tool that can be run using slickline for 2 7/8?, 3¬Ω? or 4¬Ω? tubing. This unique tool has enabled many lock open jobs in our operation and it has totally eliminated the need for flapper milling. The unexpected outcome of valve closing pressure and operating speed was experienced for a few times after the installation, causing the multiple intervention work to retrieve and to re-set the storm choke with different setting pressure. Though all minimum data required to design the storm choke for CZ-5 has been rightly considered, its performance is still very unpredictable and shocking. Determined to make the valve to work properly for a desired certain period of time, all operational data were gathered and studied. During the last rectification attempt, the storm choke has finally worked as intended. The paper will describe more on the challenges encountered during the set-up of flip open tool and modified straddle, the engineering design of both of them and the storm choke unique behaviour from the experience at Caspian Sea Operation.

AbstractA study conducted by Exxon Company, U.S.A. is described in which an operations/engineering team approach was used to establish surveillance activities and responsibilities for improving benefits from computer production control installations. These activities include identification of problem wells and lease production problems, allowable management, monitoring measurement accuracy and general system surveillance. The results of the study show that capture of benefits can be improved. An operations/engineering organization is outlined for surveillance on a continuing basis. IntroductionExxon Company, U.S.A. has successfully implemented computer production control (CPC) in four of its five operating Divisions. The CPC systems in each Division were developed based on the following three fundamental guidelines: 1. Identical computer hardware and software would be used at each Division operating level. 2. CPC information would comprise a single data source for operations, engineering, and accounting functions in the Company. 3. Field operating personnel would control the system and be an essential element in the data reliability activities. After each individual field CPC installation is complete, the major benefits of CPC lie in using automated information to increase production and improve operating efficiency. However, all benefits do not just automatically accure. In fact, some disorganization can develop among functional groups about specific surveillance activities and responsibilities. The results may be duplication of surveillance effort, overlooked surveillance activities and missed opportunities. To ensure achieving a high percentage of benefits from CPC, a concerted effort should be made to organize and establish surveillance responsibilities at the field and staff levels.

AB  - Abstract Prevention is better than cure is the right phrase to express how important sand production monitoring and surveillance to protect well integrity which consequently help securing environment, people, asset and also reputation without causing unnecessary restrictions to the production performance. This paper showcases the benefits gained from utilizing an automated Digital Integrated Operations System, or "IO" to enhance the existing Sand Monitoring and Management (SMM) workflow. Sand production will impose significant impact and key failure are mostly related to erosion and sand accumulation. Reactive management approach can be implemented in a faster manner should we have good surveillance. The IO was designed to provide critical information on the historical and current status and operating conditions of wells, production and injection equipment, as well as daily production and injection volumes based on data fed from the thousands of transmitters installed at the plant. The system is used for different applications related to production surveillance and optimization, and also includes sand management as a core module. For this purpose, it utilizes the SMM workflow by enabling visual monitoring of well sand count data and compliance to well sampling plan in the IO platform, and by performing daily computation of erosional rates together with remaining wall thickness on surface flowlines - achieved by combining live well parameters with latest sand count data, latest well test and erosion rate. Upon stringent monitoring, two (2) wells were identified by IO to be under high risk and quick action was taken to manage the risk. From IO, number of times that each well had been categorized under severity were then be validated by checking in the input data. From well monitoring and surveillance, flowing tubing head pressure (FTHP) were seen lower than trending and bean size had been fully opened. Knowing that the well is prone to be producing high amount of sand and expose to downhole integrity issue, the sand production must be controlled before it reaches to the surface. The immediate action was to choke down the well, monitor the FTHP, evaluate well test performance trending and most importantly increase the frequency of sand count. After doing so, the team observed that erosion rate has been reduced below the limit and sand count was also reduced. Simple action can be taken if we know what is the root cause in a timely manner. All this will be possible through IO. Visualization had been transparent, communication was enhanced, and collaboration boosted towards safe operation.

AB  - SummaryToday, many oil and gas production systems have flowline networks with many wells and surface pipelines. In the design of such production systems, the determination of parameters like separator pressure, the diameters of tubing, pipeline, or surface choke, and the length of pipeline is important to the achievement of an optimum production rate.The optimization of such problems, however, has been difficult because of the nonlinearity of the solution caused by the interaction between these parameters. In this work, multiple production parameters were optimized simultaneously in well networks in terms of a profit-based objective function, such as total production rate, net income from the oil product, or present value discounted by interest rates. The techniques applied in this work were Newton-type methods (derivative based), the polytope method (function-value based), and a new technique that uses a genetic algorithm (GA). On the basis of several test calculations on various types of optimization problems, the polytope method turned out to be the most efficient and consistent for low dimension problems with small numbers of wells, while the GA performed well in large systems with many variables to be optimized.The optimization of a pipeline network system was achieved successfully without any limitation on the selection of objective functions and decision variables to be optimized. The optimization technique can be used in the design stage of newly developed fields or in the planning of workovers in existing fields. The combination of this technique with reservoir simulation would be a powerful tool in a project implementation design process.IntroductionIn today's oil industry, there are many types of production systems, depending on the field size, surface conditions, or production strategies in each oil or gas field. Most of the systems take the form of a network of pipelines and wells to gather the products for further separation or refining.

AB  - A wireline tractor has been developed with an integrated individual arm-closing mechanism that enables losing traction in only one arm while all the others are delivering the traction necessary to overcome the increased force in navigating an obstacle. Wireline tractors convey logging tools, perforating guns, and mechanical services in highly deviated and horizontal wells. In many cases, they are an efficient alternative to coiled tubing because of their small footprint, quick deployment, minimal flow disruption, and fast tractoring speed. However, tractors cannot easily negotiate obstacles such as restrictions, completion equipment, pipe damage, and debris accumulation. This problem is tied to the traction principle. When the tractor encounters an obstacle, higher push force is required, which means higher pressure is needed on the arms to increase the grip. At the same time, one arm must close to navigate the obstacle, which requires lower arm pressure. The solution has been to operate two entire tractors in tandem and close one tractor at a time through the restriction. This method necessitates to run an excessive number of assets and increases the toolstring length. To solve this problem, a wireline tractor has been developed that uses an individual arm-closing mechanism. This unique feature enables losing the traction of only one arm while the other arms are delivering the traction to overcome the increased force. This mechanism is built in the tool and is available at any time without any specific tool preparation, planning, or module addition, which eliminates undesirable trips in and out of the wells to reconfigure the toolstring in case of an unexpected obstacle. This innovation has been successfully qualified in many tractor operations. Two cases in the Gulf of Mexico offshore and in North America land will be presented in which this feature was instrumental to reduce the toolstring length and asset overdeployment in overcoming expected and unexpected completion restrictions. In the first operation, this solution enabled to navigate several side pocket mandrels, which are well-known challenges for tractors due to their complex geometries. In the second case, it saved a deemed inevitable trip to reconfigure the tractor on surface when the tractor encountered an unexpected completion restriction. The breakthrough design of the arm-closing mechanism significantly increases overall tractor ability to successfully reach the job objective while reducing nonproductive time, resulting in more efficient operations and reduced costs.

AB  - AbstractAccelerated production, increased ultimate recovery, and reduced interventions are goals of any operating company. It is now possible to attain all of these goals simultaneously by retrofitting intelligent well technology to an existing, conventional completion. This task is much more complex when the new technology must be installed in conjunction with artificial lift, such as an electric submersible pump (ESP). However, new technology and procedures have overcome this complexity and offer a viable option for optimizing production in existing completions that use artificial lift. Commingled or selective production from two or more zones is an ideal method of accelerating production from a single well. Traditional designs require interventions into the well to select the intervals to be produced. In most ESP wells, commingling is achieved by using "Y" blocks which allow production tubing to be run from the tubing hanger to the zones of interest. The ESP must then be downsized to accommodate this side-string, which significantly reduces available pump horsepower. This paper focuses on single-ESP wells producing from multiple pay zones. Various application patterns for use of intelligent well technology beneath ESPs are presented, especially focusing on immediate and future benefits. Theoretical examples are presented to illustrate how intelligent completions can enhance the ESP performance, add flexibility, and extend the range of application for a given pump.IntroductionIntelligent well technology has become an important part of oil and gas recovery. At the time intelligent wells were conceived in the industry, it was considered that intelligent completions would be mostly used in high-end wells, like subsea and deepwater installations, where the high cost of intervention made conventional completions uneconomical. Application of this technology has continued to expand since recent installation results have demonstrated the value of these completions with a high success rate.ESP systems are often used in older reservoirs on wells with relatively high water cuts. ESP provides cost-effective production by lifting fluid production from these less efficient, mature reservoirs. Successful ESP production depends on operating within an optimum operating range of the selected pump. Due to changes in the formation over time, the ESP may not be able to stay within the desired operating range of the pump and its efficiency may drop to an unacceptable level.Remote controlled open/close devices are mature, reliable and relatively inexpensive. They afford many cost-effective applications when used in combination with artificial lift technology. Moreover, a user of ESPs has already committed to running electric lines and protectors along the completion. Adding a few more lines to accommodate intelligent completions is a small incremental cost. This creates the combination of challenge and potential for value creation that results in economical advantage through leverage of intelligent well technology. There are several template application patterns that support usage of intelligent wells under ESPs. A more specific field application has been reported in a previous publication.[1]The objective of this paper is to provide theoretical strategies for optimizing ESP performance by using downhole chokes in a well producing from multiple zones. We first present a mathematical model for a single zone case that is extended to multi-zone applications. Using the model, we also present a comparative example for different completion patterns and discuss the benefit of each application. The infinite variable or multi-position chokes can add more flexibility, improve ESP operating efficiency, and thus extend the life of a given pump, which reduces the operating costs and improves the productivity and recovery factors of a well.

AB  - Summary The objective of this study is to develop and validate a theoretical slip model for two-phase flow through chokes. As opposed to the models (Sachdeva et al. 1986; Perkins 1993) used currently by the industry, the present model accounts for slippage between the liquid and gas phases as they pass through the choke. The theoretical basis of the model is a 1D balance equation of mass, momentum, and energy with the assumptions of constant quality and incompressible liquid phase. The present slip model is capable of predicting the critical-subcritical-flow boundary and the critical and subcritical mass-flow rates. A model-validation study demonstrated the capability of the slip models to predict the critical-flow boundary with an average error and standard deviation of 5.2% and 15.5%, respectively. Furthermore, in a laboratory validation, the present slip model predicted the mass-flow rate with an average error of 2.7% and 12.5% standard deviation. Compared with field data, the present slip model predicted the mass-flow rate with 1.4% average percent error and 15% standard deviation. Compared to existing no-slip models (Sachdeva et al. 1986; Perkins 1993) used commonly by the industry, the present slip-model predictions outperformed their predictions in the average percent error in both laboratory and field validation and in the standard deviation in the laboratory validation only. This validation result indicates the importance of the slippage phenomenon.

AB  - Abstract Evaluating pressure drop changes across Pressure Control Valves (PCVs) is a key element for identifying potential gas incremental opportunities and determining potential energy loss in maturing gas fields. This is more critical when the gas reservoir is being depleted without a pressure maintenance suport program. A dedicated production tracking and monitoring process is required for a full evaluation of every component in the gas production system; from downhole to the gas plant. Operational data and choke valve erosion velocity calculations from 60 gas producing wells were evaluated to identify PCV's needing replacement and optimize production strategy. These wells were experiencing high PCV pressure drops, constraining their ability to produce at maximum potential. Factors such as Cv; internal damage or plugging were evaluated to determine the cause of the under sized PCV&apos;s. Additional efforts were required to verify the sizes of installed PCV&apos;s and to ensure that flow rates could be properly calculated by recalibration of instrumentation and validation of venturi meter calculations. A PCV replacement program was then established to maximize the productivity of seven (7) critical high producing wells. This paper describes the multi-disciplinary approach and methodology implemented in North Central Ghawar Gas field to optimize the performance of installed gas well pressure control valves. This methodology will continue to be implemented and expanded to cover more than 500 wells in other Saudi Aramco gas fields. The paper discusses additional topics such as: proper design and metallurgy of pressure control valves, new evaluation model for pressure control valve flow equations, gas rate validation, building PCV simulator model using dedicated well performance tools, screening tools and an economic model. Implementing this program is essential to maximizing gas rates and optimizing field production by identifying undersized PCV&apos;s that need to be sent to the shop for internal inspection and maintenance or replacement.

AB  - Abstract A retrievable packer and bridge plug have recently been developed which are designed to be run with coiled tubing for production operations. This 3.375-inch (8.573 cm) OD tool (reference is to packers and plugs collectively) is set and released within coiled tubing's pressure and pull limitations with pumped fluids and is used as an anchor and seal. The inflatable element allows passage of the tool through tubing restrictions and can then be inflated and set in casing up to 7-inch (17.78 cm). The authors have been associated with 29 jobs in the West Operating Area of Prudhoe Bay utilizing these tools. These tools have proven effective in their primary application of mechanical isolation for selective zone stimulations through coiled tubing. This paper provides a discussion of the tool, insight from the authors' experience into the application and limitations of these useful tools, as well as operational guidelines developed for their running and retrieval in production applications. Accurate depth control is a concern when small intervals are available for setting. Elongation of coiled tubing under the pressures required for setting these tools is discussed. Operational guidelines are presented for determining length changes as a function of depth and pressure to ensure accurate control of setting depths. Depth control procedures presented here have permitted the setting of these tools within 15 inches [38.1 cm) of target at depths over 10,000 feet 3048 ml in deviated wells under favorable completion conditions. Brief discussions of cost benefits and downhole injection chokes are also included. Introduction A Retrievable Coiled Tubing Packer (Packer) and Bridge Plug (Plug) have been developed and field-tested at Prudhoe Bay. The principal applications for these Packers and Plugs are: A. Selective stimulation treatments by isolating a zone from a stimulation treatment utilizing either a Packer to stimulate a lower zone or a Plug to stimulate an upper zone; B. Shut-off of a lower production interval utilizing a Plug; and C. Profile modification in an injection well utilizing either a packer in conjunction with a choke to reduce injection, or a plug to eliminate injection into a lower zone. Since January 1987, 15 Packers have been successfully set in the West Operating Area of Prudhoe Bay for selective stimulations. Once successfully set, only one Packer failed during the job. One of the successful jobs was a three-day polymer profile modification treatment where 4624 barrels [735.2 m3] of cross-linked polymer were pumped into a thief zone. Figure 1 shows a typical coiled tubing Packer operation. Figure 2A shows a Packer set in position. Three inflatable Packers have been set in water injection wells as a foundation for choke assemblies to modify injection profiles. P. 401^

AB  - Abstract The critical and subcritical multiphase flow through wellhead restrictions of a prolific oil field in the Middle East is investigated and two sets of new correlations are presented. The first set of correlations is developed by using "40?? field tests representing critical flow conditions. The second set of correlations is based on "139?? field tests representing subcritical flow conditions of gas-liquid mixtures through wellhead chokes. For the critical multiphase flow condition, the predicted oil flow rates by the new set of correlations are in excellent agreement with the measured ones. The absolute average percent difference (AAPD) is between "1.88?? and "4.37??, and the corresponding standard of deviation (SD) is between "2.52?? and "6.52??. These results are found to be statistically superior to those predicted by other published correlations considered in this work. During the subcritical gas-liquid flow conditions through surface chokes, the accuracy of oil flow rates predicted by the new set of correlations seems to be sensitive to the type and size of the choke being used. For Cameron LD type and 144/64th -inch choke, the oil flow rates predicted by the proposed correlation are superior to those predicted by other methods available in the literature, with AAPD of "8.5??. However, for smaller choke sizes of 96/64th and 64/64th -inch, the oil flow rates predicted by the new correlations and other methods are found to be close to each other. For Cameron F type and 144/64th -inch choke size, the oil flow rates predicted by the new correlation are closely matched by those predicted by other published methods, with AAPD of "13.7??. For smaller choke sizes of 80/64th and 64/64th -inch few field tests are available and the predications of all methods, including the proposed ones, show similar statistical results. The above findings for Cameron F choke also seem to apply to Beaned wellhead assemblies for this particular oil field. Introduction The main problems associated with multiphase flow through restrictions are calculation of (i) pressure upstream from choke, (ii) liquid production rate, or (iii) choke diameter. Thus, various developments have been published that present theory and correlations for describing simultaneous liquid and gas flow through surface restrictions. Most of these correlations are for critical flow across the choke and very little work has been done for subcritical flow. Fonseca (1972) showed that the approach used by most investigators may be classified into one of the following: (i)¬†Empirical correlations from field or laboratory data. (ii)¬†Empirical correlations using dimensional analysis to select and group the most important variables. (iii)¬†Theoretical approaches applying mathematical analysis to a simplified physical model with development of equations. Beggs and Brill (1975) stated that the two-phase flow through restrictions may fall into one of the following categories: Critical flow: this occurs when the fluid flows through the choke at velocities greater than that of sound in that fluid. To satisfy this condition in oil field work the upstream pressure must be approximately twice the downstream pressure. Subcritical flow: this occurs when the velocity of the fluid is less than the velocity of sound in that fluid.

AB  - ABSTRACTFor drilling high pressure wells in the North Sea Central Area, it became necessary to develop a complete 15,000 working pressure B.O.P. System that could be used on any available rig without any major modification. The choke and kill line system had therefore to be quickly adaptable to any existing 10,000 psi W.P. marine riser. This system comprises:A double drum pneumatic winch. Two long continuous flexible kill and choke lines spooled onto this winch and clamped onto the existing riser whilst running it. Two tension clamps set at mid barrel of the telescopic joint. Two davit roller guide assemblies attached to the riser retainer ring. A certain number of guide clamps easily attached to the riser joint flanges, which keep the flexible choke and kill lines running parallel to the marine riser. Used on board the Sedco 709, this system brought the following advantages: Total flexibility. Pick and simple installation onto the existing riser. Suppression of the great separating forces due to the high pressure on the riser corrector known as the "pin pump out effect" therefore increased safety. The interest of such a system is further enhanced as it is well suited for floating production systems and for quick intervention to kill wild subsea wells as it has been done for DITOC I blowout. INTRODUCTIONIn recent years offshore drilling has been performed in ever deeper water and to greater depths thus increasing the complexity of the process Specifically, higher pressure has been encountered making necessary roared effective teleology and equipment. On floating offshore drilling vessels there exists the requirement for numerous flexible junctions to aid the continuous flow of the various fluids in the system. Of utmost importance are the flexible lines utilized in correcting the subsea blowout prevented stack and the choke and kill Mani folding at the surface. Currently these lines are primarily utilized in relatively short lengths around the subsea ball joint to offset the lateral movement of the drilling vessel and in the moon pool at the telescopic joint to compensate for vertical Movement due to heave. Flexible pipes, such as those manufactured by Coflexip since 1972, have been designed to meet a variety of drilling and production applications. Their application has gained acceptance by the major oil companies and drilling contractors worldwide. The utilization of a continuous 500 foot length flexible 15,000 psi working pressure choke and kill system from blowout prevented stack to deck by Shell U.K. Exploration & Production on the Sedco 709 has extended this application to its fullest potential. Shell U.K. and Coflexip have thus initiated a .revolutionary method of installing and upgrading drilling riser choke and kill systems. This technique system allows increased safety, reduced riser maintenance, and rapid upgrading of existing equipment.

AB  - Abstract The complex geology, geomechanics and flow mechanisms make it difficult to predict the drainage area of shale wells, and thus the estimated ultimate recovery (EUR) from these reservoirs. A large uncertainty in predicting the drainage area and EUR can result in a sub-optimal development plan - a key factor driving the economics of such reservoirs. To increase our confidence in the drainage area and EUR predictions in the Haynesville, we applied an integrated production analysis approach using multiple data types from a single multi-frac horizontal well with a rich dataset. The analysis integrates Flowing Material Balance (FMB), Pressure Transient Analysis (PTA), Rate Transient Analysis (RTA), Decline Curve Analysis (DCA), and analytical/numerical reservoir simulation. Using detailed well completion and production logging data, we created nine alternative models that honored the historical production and flowing pressure data. These alternative forecasts were generated using readily available commercial software that includes the Multi-frac Horizontal Composite (MFC) model, the Enhanced Fracture Region (EFR) model and the General Multi-frac (GMF) model. In this paper, we demonstrate how certain models used routinely in the industry may be too simplistic, and how these models can be progressively improved as more production and flowing pressure data become available with time. Our results demonstrate the following: Permanent down-hole pressure gauges, hourly metered production rates and production logs provide high frequency historical data that enable more insightful PTA, RTA and detailed non-uniform fractured reservoir simulation models; Inclusion of higher frequency data and geomechanical (i.e. pressure dependency) effects are critical for both PTA and RTA in shale wells. This is especially true where permeability dependence on pressure has been documented, such as in the Haynesville. PTA can be useful in constraining the history-match but the results are still non-unique; Routinely used uniform fracture half-length/evenly-spaced fracture analytical models may be too idealized for optimizing well spacing and completion design. Numerical reservoir simulation models with more detailed and realistic reservoir characterization and fracture dimensions are therefore key in planning appropriate well spacing; This work provides valuable guidelines for data acquisition and prediction of shale gas EUR and optimal well spacing.

AB  - Abstract In recent years, the effort put forth toward the advancement of steamflood technology for improved heavy oil-recovery has seen considerable growth. A significant portion of the costs associated with a portion of the costs associated with a steamflood operation may be attributed to the generation of the steam required for injection. It is extremely important, therefore, that a high degree of accuracy is maintained in the measurement and control of the resulting steam-water mixture at each individual well. In fields where the required injection pressures are relatively low, the most common method of controlling the flow rate utilizes critical flow static chokes. New data are presented for the flow of steam-water through critical flow static chokes at conditions representative of a typical steam flood operation. The experimental data re a result of testing in Texaco's new Steam Flow Research arch Facility. The experimental data covers a wide range of inlet qualities (20 to 100%) and inlet pressures (400 to 800 psig) for static choke bean diameters of 24/64 and 28/64 inch. The Thornhill-Craver empirical correlation predicts all of the experimentally measure values of critical mass flow rate within 10%. For inlet qualities 40%, all data is predicted within 5%; below 40%, the equation over-predicts the critical flow data. The Napier equation modified for wet steam by King and Crocker over-predicts the critical mass flow rate at the present range of operating conditions. Introduction Critical flow in pipes refers to the flow phenomenon which occurs when the fluids phenomenon which occurs when the fluids achieve sonic velocities. For fixed inlet flow conditions in a constant diameter flow restriction, any changes in the downstream conditions do not affect the upstream conditions. Since critical flow static chokes were originally introduced to the oil industry primarily to control gas flow rates from gas wells, earlier efforts towards understanding the flow mechanics of critical flow were based on an perfect gas law behavior. Some experimental studies in steam flow have led to the development of empirical correlations for the determination of critical mass flow rate of wet steam. However, a search through the available literature indicates none has been tested in a laboratory controlled environment over the range of operating conditions typical of a thermal recovery operation. It is the intent of this work, therefore, to generate a data base at these conditions in order to evaluate existing, or aid in the development of new, correlations. The following is a list of objectives which the present investigation has undertaken: 1. To introduce Texaco's new state-of-the-art Steam Flow Research Facility and highlight the current range of operating conditions. P. 9

AB  - AbstractIn this paper we discuss the main experimental results obtained during the field verification tests of the Well Flow Analyser (WFA). The WFA is a multiphase flow meter developed by SENSORTEKNIKK (Norway) and ENI, with the support of NORSK AGIP and STATOIL. The WFA predicts the flow rates of each component (oil, water, gas) in the multiphase stream, by analysing the noise generated by the fluid when passing across a choke valve. The instrument has been tested extensively in real conditions in the Trecate test loop which is located in the Trecate - Villafortuna oil field, at about 60 Km from Milan. The system used for the tests is relatively simple: it consists of an acoustic sensor installed on a Willis choke and a signal processing unit controlled by a personal computer.We highlight the main technical challenges that have been overcome and the performance of the instrument, as a result of the tests carried out in Trecate along 1997.The development of the instrument required the application of advanced processing techniques, such as digital signal processing algorithms (Fast Fourier Transform, Wavelet transform), multivariate statistical analysis and the use of neural network models, to extract the information related to the multiphase flow from the acoustic spectra. The resulting instrument has been tested on a broad range of oil, gas and water flow conditions, providing flow rate estimations with an average error of 5%-15%.Finally, we describe the benefits related to the application of the WFA to well testing measurements, as well as the problems related to its calibration.P. 429

AB  - AbstractIn the effort to reduce costs, many companies are investigating the cost effectiveness of completing some types of workover operations without removing the production tubing. These operations include scale removal, frac sand removal, squeeze-reperfing, underreaming and junk/fish removal. All of these operations are currently feasible using either slimhole work strings or coiled tubing in conjunction with slimhole PDM's. This paper describes the tools and procedures used to complete these operations and compares their cost effectiveness with conventional operations. A section is included on new tools being developed which should broaden the scope of these operations. The paper concludes that slimhole workover drilling operations can provide substantial economic benefits compared to conventional workover methods. IntroductionThe introduction of coiled tubing and snubbing units has changed the art of workover operations. The addition of recently developed, powerful, reliable Slimhole positive displacement motors has further expanded the usefulness of these units. Many drilling operations can be perform without removing the production tubing. Common uses for this equipment include obstruction removal inside the production tubing. The obstructions production tubing. The obstructions may range from frac sand to stuck packers. Technological advances are packers. Technological advances are rapidly expanding the applications for Slimhole drilling equipment. Recent successful developments include coiled tubing underreaming and the downhole power swivel. The under reamers allow full-bore clean-out the casing below the production tubing. The downhole power swivel allows the safe utilization of small diameter workstrings. On the horizon, coiled tubing fishing and openhole drilling with coiled tubing are new methods which will likely be tested in early 1991. P. 645

AB  - Abstract Organic precipitation during the production of hydrocarbons has proven to be a production assurance problem experienced in the majority of oil and gas fields throughout the world. Paraffin and asphaltene deposition occurs in several areas of the production system including: the reservoir, wellbore components including the perforation face and production tubing, surface components such as chokes and on flowlines, and also in production equipment downstream. In an effort to maintain optimum production, removal of existing restrictions is essential, just as minimizing the deposition of same. There is no universally effective treatment for organic deposition. Proper identification of the deposit, design and implementation of the treatment is essential to the cost effective production of oil and gas wells experiencing the problem. The most common methods of removal include: mechanical means, chemicals of various types, heat techniques and micro-organisms. This paper analyzes the results of a chemical treatment exercise executed in the Southwest Soldado Oil Field, an offshore asset owned by the Petroleum Company of Trinidad and Tobago Limited (Petrotrin). A paraffin dispersant-asphaltene inhibitor was applied as a method of cost-effectively optimizing production, in a field within which organic precipitation is inescapable as a result of the crude's nature coupled with conditions necessary for deposition. Successful application of this treatment in eight (8) flowing wells and seven (7) flowline segments resulted in increased production levels within the field, despite the production constraints experienced within the field at the time. As a result of this success, apart from expansion of the exercise and treatment on an annual basis, continuous chemical treatment systems were introduced to the field, as a means of minimizing deposition on flowlines and in flowing and PCP wells.

AB  - ABSTRACTIn this development effort, a new family of wellhead connectors was designed, analyzed, and tested. The design criteria are outlined, the optimization routine is described, and the weight capacity and the makeup time are described in comparative terms relative to the API flange. The test results for a connector design are compared with finite element analysis (FEA), and the results are correlated with the predictions and criteria.INTRODUCTIONThe traditional API flange and clamp connections have served the industry well for many years. Some of the disadvantages of these connection systems include slow makeup times, high torques, and handling problems. These drawbacks, along with a requirement for increased safety and efficiency, indicated a need for an alternative end connection. An initial incentive was provided by an oil company that required a wellhead system for a slant drilled well where flange makeup would be difficult. The "other end connection" (OEC) used for this application was based on a marine riser connection which has been used in subsea drilling for many years and fulfilled the end user's requirement that the OEC utilize "field-proven technology." (Figure 1).The long term industry requirement was reviewed, and a functional and operational requirement specification was generated. The main features of this specification were as follows:Safety: The mandrel should have an outside diameter that is capable of passing through either a BOP stack or diverter (depending on connection size). This would facilitate the landing of casing hangers and setting of the packoffs with BOP protection.Connection Capacity: The connection should have a capability equivalent to the API flange, considering pressure, tension, and bending. Connection separation would be deemed as connection failure.Connection Makeup: The connection should be fast makeup (initial target of 15 to 30 minutes for a 13-5/8", 15,000 psi connection). The required makeup torque should be minimized (initial target of 1,000 ft-lb for the 13-5/8", 15,000 psi connection. Ideally, no specialized tooling should be required for makeup or breakout of the connection.Performance Verification: The connection should meet the performance verification testing to PR2 as outlined in API 6A, Sixteenth Edition, Appendix F. The temperature rating of the connector should be in line with API 6A classifications P through X.DESIGN AND DEVELOPMENTCommon Mandrel For New Designs: Having established the desirability of an OEC, a brief review of the market was made and outline concepts were produced. It was felt that a low cost clamp type connection should be developed for production applications where a single or low number of makeup cycles was likely (the NF clamp, Figure 3). The dog type connector would be required for the drilling (BOP) mode (the NT-2 connector, Figure 4A).It was felt that the number of mandrel profiles should be minimized and that the mandrel profile should be common for all pressure ranges within a certain nominal size. This would ease any interface problems with BOP stacks. A decision was made to design and prototype test the following sizes: 13-5/8", 15,000 psi and 21-1/4", 5,000 psi.

AB  - Abstract Oil wells performance can be determined from completed zone productivity, completion type and size, and surface facilities. A significant surface tool, wellhead choke, can profoundly impact on the well performance. Determining the optimum choke size can result in improving the production of the well by altering the wellhead pressure, therefore the pressure drop. Increasing the bean size above optimum might result in decreasing wellhead pressure below flowline pressure and prevent the oil from flowing. To determine the optimum choke size for oil well; live trial and error could be helpful, though it is not practical and need to be combined with a well simulation analysis and history matching. A multiphase flow simulator is applied on a set of selected wells, having bottlenecks and backpressure issues in Kuwaiti oilfields. The simulation has been developed by choosing a precise flow correlation that presents a reliable flow behavior and pressure drop results. A comparison of different flow correlations was performed against the actual test readings to eliminate a potential error from the simulation against the actual readings. Changing the choke bean size was a quick, effective, and economical solution to overcome the bottlenecks and backpressure issues in individual candidates. Simulating the formation productivity and assessing the well performance and changing the choke size can increase the successfulness chance of the live trial and error procedure. It can also help in categorizing the wells whether to be a candidate to have choke size change, or another solution is required to flow the well such as a surface pump, artificial lift, or changing the receiving facility pressure, if possible. All the selected eighteen wells are vertical or slightly deviated with an oil API gravity between 32 and 35 degrees, and the flow behavior correlations were between the Beggs and Brill (1973) empirical correlation and the Ansari (1994) mechanistic model. The comparison between multiple sensitivity analyses proved that both models are reliable and can be applied to the selected field. Simulating the wells had increased the choke size debottlenecking approach successfulness rate by 70 percent, and increase the oil production up to 6,000 barrels per day. A debottlenecking analysis is presented in this project, and supported with data matching and field test results. The procedure to optimize the choke size is explained in details using a multiphase flow simulator and an in-house developed excel sheet. Several additional approaches were analyzed to overcome backpressure issues, like using ESP artificial lift method.

AB  - Abstract Natural gas hydrate formation is a costly and challenging problem for the oil and gas industry. Prediction of hydrates have been carried out through rigorous and laborious solving of mathematical equations called equations of state (EOS) which give accurate results but require appropriate setup and time. Few examples of such equations of state currently used by industry benchmarked software tools include Peng-Robinson (PR), Cubic-Plus-Association (CPA), Soave-Redlich-Kwong (SRK) etc. which more or less provide us with an accurate hydrate stability curve i.e. a pressure-temperature profile for a given composition, which allows us to keep the pressures and temperatures (operating conditions) out of the hydrate stability zone. Hydrate stability curves are a function of the composition of the fluid (gas) being produced. Compositional changes in the percentage of C1 to C7+ components of gas, would not only affect the specific gravity, but would also change the hydrate stability curve of the gas significantly. Previous studies have been aimed at finding a quick and precise prediction method for hydrate formation, so as to make swift arrangements to counter any chance of flow assurance issue. Different empirical correlations have been developed on the basis of the composition of the gas being produced that take into consideration the pressure and predict the temperature of hydrate formation. Multiple data points, i.e. fluid compositions from different areas/fields are considered and correlations have been developed to fit the hydrate stability zones of these data points which were found through a more accurate equation of state. As the initial data sets for each correlation are different, the possibility of any two correlations giving the correct and same prediction is very low. This paper gives an insight into how different empirical correlations like Hammershmidt, Motiee, Makogon, Towler and Mokhtab etc., that have already been derived can be used with better accuracy for a set of different fluid compositions and specific gravities. A sensitivity analysis is done on the performance of each correlation against the accurate hydrate curves found out through the software tool, using different available equations of state. The data points picked here are random and were not included in any data sets adopted for derivation of the correlation. Furthermore, the mimicked hydrate curve from this new method is cast against the software simulated hydrate curve for a flow assurance steady state simulation study with two deepwater gas wells with different gas compositions. The results of the study suggest that the use of the imitated hydrate curve through analytical approach works well in predicting the hydrate stability zone. It would also not require any software proficiency, would give quick results and would cost a fraction compared to the state of the art simulators.

AB  - Abstract Chokes are used to limit production rates to meet sale contract, comply with regulations, protect surface equipment from wearing out, avoid sand problems due to high drawdown, and control flow rate limited by capacity of the facility. Single gas phase flow through choke is vital to oil industry because not only an accurate estimation of gas flow rate guarantees a reliable supply to the end users, thus the predictable revenue from gas sale for the company, but also protect the equipment from breaking as a result of high gas rate. Nevertheless, importance of gas metering cannot be overemphasized. Gas flow through choke had been studied by numerous investigators, Different choke flow models are available from the literature, and they have to be chosen based on the flow regimes, that is, subsonic or sonic flow. The most common used flow equations developed by Shapiro, Zucrow and Hofmann are used for subsonic and sonic flow, respectively. Sonic flow happens when downstream to upstream pressure ratio is equal to critical pressure ratio. A careful review of these equations indicated that they are not theoretically rigorous and give inaccurate gas flow rate for the real gas. Thus these equations need to be modified in order to be used to calculate gas flow rate under both flow regimes. After a thoroughly analysis and derivation we came up with equations that have solid base. New correlations that reconcile the issue caused by approximation method used to derive the old gas flow equations were based on both engineering judgment and physical phenomenon. The error in the old equation can be corrected with the new equations. New equations provide good approaches to quantify gas flow through choke. Introduction Gas experiences a choked flow when it passes through a restriction, such as a nozzle, an orifice, or a valve, into a lower pressure environment. Usually these types of restrictions are called chokes. Choke can be classified as fixed diameter choke and adjustable diameter choke. The knowledge of choke performance will help us understand the gas transient flow through choke. It is useful for pipe/tank leakage detection and analysis as well. Choke performance can be used to detect the blockage in the pipe due to scaling or hydration. As we already know, gas flow through choke can be divided into subsonic flow and sonic flow according to flow regime. Sonic flow is defined as whenever the fluid flow velocity through a choke or throated pipe reaches the velocity of sound in the fluid under the in-situ condition. In another word, the upstream cannot "feel?? the pressure wave propagated from downstream upward since the fluid is travelling in the opposite direction with the same velocity under sonic flow conditions. At this point, it is necessary to clarify a common mistake that thinks the flow rate did not change due to maximum velocity even the upstream pressure changes. This is incorrect because although the velocity is constant, the density varies as pressure changes, so does the mass flow rate. Therefore an increasing in upstream pressure will increase the mass flow rate. Since the estimations of the gas velocity and the sound velocity are not always easy to be accomplished in the field. From the practical point of view, downstream to upstream pressure ratio is often used to determine if the flow falls in sonic flow or subsonic region is the critical pressure ratio. The critical pressure ratio is a function of the specific heat ratio of gas, which is expressed as (Perry, 1984)

AB  - AbstractThe success of a primary cement job is often measured according to effective zonal isolation, achieving the designed top of cement and avoidance of remedial cementing. In the San Juan and Rio Arriba Counties of New Mexico, many Mesa Verde and Dakota wells are air-drilled because the Mesa Verde formation is sub-normally pressured and is naturally fractured. This combination makes the Mesa Verde easy to hydraulically fracture during normal drilling and cementing operations. Therefore, meeting the primary cement job success criterion is particularly challenging.Cementing of casing within an air-drilled wellbore allows the slurry to free fall. Cement-free fall can cause severe surge pressures at the bottom of the hole, leading to hydraulic fracture initiation and loss of lift. The use of a downhole choke can be employed to prevent these processes from occurring.Because mud filter cake does not exist in an air-drilled hole, the lead water spacer and cement must wet the casing and wellbore rock surfaces. Loss of the lead water spacer in conjunction with cement water loss can produce dehydration of the cement column, leading to an increase in cement viscosity and equivalent circulating density. Careful control of cement-free water and fluid loss are required to prevent this from occurring. Furthermore, placing cement across targeted completion intervals which have low fracture gradients requires the use of a high-compressive strength, low-density cement which is competent and capable of maintaining zonal isolation during the completion and production phases of well construction.This paper will outline the evolution of the cementing practices used for the Mesa Verde and Dakota wells drilled in the 29-6 Unit (T29N - R6W, New Mexico) from 1998 to 2002. It will illustrate how cementing changes enabled the primary cementing to be successfully completed in a single stage instead of two, which has translated into cost savings for both the drilling and completion phases of a well. The impact of using a downhole choke for the pumping and placement of these primary cement jobs will be illustrated and discussed. The function of the cement additives on slurry properties will also be discussed as they pertain to these cement jobs.IntroductionThe Mesa Verde and Dakota formations of the San Juan and Rio Arriba counties of New Mexico are two of the primary completion targets for this area of the San Juan Basin. Figure 1 shows a 500 square-mile view of the "Four Corners" area of the United States, with the San Juan and Rio Arriba counties identified.Figure 2 is a stratigraphic column of the San Juan Basin. It illustrates the Dakota and Mesa Verde formations, along with other productive formations. The Dakota group is composed of a series of Cretaceous, lenticular sandstones and shales. The nomenclature and designation of the individual layers vary and are beyond the scope of this paper. The Dakota formation is found at depths ranging between 7,000 and 8,000 feet, currently making it the deepest productive interval in the San Juan Basin. The Mesa Verde group can be located at depths ranging between 4,500 and 6,500 feet and is also composed of a series of Cretaceous formations. These consist of the Point Lookout, Menefee, and Cliffhouse, from shallowest to deepest deposition, respectively. The Mesa Verde represents a group of subnormally pressured reservoirs with original gradients having been measured at approximately 0.25 psi/ft. However, continued pressure depletion of the Mesa Verde has resulted in a reservoir gradient less than 0.15 psi/ft in most areas of the San Juan Basin.1Due to the low-pressure gradients associated with the Mesa Verde formations, it has become a standard practice of many operators to utilize air-drilling techniques. While this practice eliminates the concerns over lost circulation during drilling, it can pose significant challenges to achieving a successful primary cement job. A successful primary cement job is often measured according to effective zonal isolation, achieving the designed top of cement and avoidance of remedial cementing.

AB  - ABSTRACT As crude oil is always produced with water in the oilfield industry, very tight water-in-crude oil emulsions can form due to turbulence phenomena in the choke valve at the wellhead or in production pipelines. In order to better understand the main physicochemical and hydrodynamic parameters that govern the formation of concentrated emulsions through the choke-valve, we have developed a specific experimental liquid-liquid loop in the laboratory. The experimental set-up comprises (1) a flow entry section that allows the production of narrow size droplets distribution, (2) a vertical pipe containing a circular restriction, and (3) a zone of separation of water and oil (continuous gravity box settler). Droplets size upstream and downstream the restriction are measured by image analysis delivered by a high speed video camera. Pressure drop is measured across the orifice by a differential pressure sensor. The objective of the present study is to predict the evolution of the size distribution of the liquid/liquid dispersion downstream the restriction as a function of hydrodynamic parameters and physico-chemical properties of the system. First results show that the experimental set-up design provides an easy observation of droplets break-up through the restriction. They confirm the main tendencies proposed by global models in the case of dilute dispersions. In addition, experiments based on the observation of single drop break-up allowed to identify different break-up mechanisms and to derive relevant statistical quantities.

AB  - This paper was presented as part of the student paper contest associatedwith the European Petroleum Conference.AbstractProduction of a well at high water cut is associated with problems inseparation efficiency of the oil-in-water emulsion. In this, the smallest sizesof the oil droplets are the decisive factor, negatively and greatly influencedby the choke valve. This valve breaks the produced distribution down to toomany and too small droplets for the separation equipment to economically cleanthe water and isolate the oil.Laboratory experiments allowed us to investigate the break-up effects ofchoke valves and to validate existing predictive theories. By using differentchoke types, significant reduction of break-up was accomplished. The effect ofchoke geometry on break-up is explained by an interplay of the time thatdroplets remain in a choke on the one hand, and the time needed for completebreak-up under the current turbulence regime on the other. Hereby, the spatialdistribution of energy dissipation, linked to the geometry of the choke, playsan important role.IntroductionOften water is produced along with oil. When the age of a well matures, thewater cut tends to increase. In the after-life of a well, the percentage ofwater can by far exceed that of oil. Wells with water cuts of 95% are noexception, which implies that these wells produce an oil-in-water emulsion.Chokes are installed on every well to control the pressure and flow rate.They work on the basis of energy dissipation by increased turbulence.Downstream of the valve the pressure is brought down to safer values to workwith, and the emulsified liquids must be separated. This should be donecarefully in order not to loose valuable oil and to clean the water beforedisposal. The efficiency of a separator is confined by the droplet-sizedistribution offered to it.

AB  - The most important contributer to Improved Oil Recovery (IOR) on mature fields is drilling of infill wells. Managed Pressure Drilling (MPD) and Continuous Circulation System (CCS) techniques can be used for improved control of bottomhole pressure when drilling wells in depleted fields with narrow pressure windows, but rig heave is a challenge when drilling from floating drilling units. Rig heave, caused by sea waves, induces pressure oscillations downhole that may exceed the operational pressure window. These oscillations are called "surge & swab" and occur both during tripping in and out of hole as well as during drill pipe connections, when the topside heave compensation system used during drilling is disabled because the drill pipe is put in slips. Downhole choking was introduced as a method to reduce downhole pressure oscillations induced by the rig heave and the concept was tested in laboratory scale and using computer simulations (Kvernland et al., 2018). The simulations were perfomed using a purpose-developed software which utilizes such input variables as wave height, pump flow, drill pipe movements, rig characteristic (RAO), drilling fluid properties as well as well design, drill pipe and Bottom Hole Assembly (BHA) data to simulate downhole pressure, induced by rig heave. The simulator is designed to model dynamic interactions between the drilling fluid and the drill string in a rigorous manner, which gives it ability to accurately predict fast downhole changes, such as ones induced by ocean waves. This paper gives an overview of the surge & swab simulator, describing its capabilities and limitations. Data from drilling of a North Sea well is then used to validate the simulations made using the software. The well, used as example in this paper, was drilled conventionally from a floating rig. The downhole pressure variations recorded during three different drill pipe connections are compared with simulated downhole pressure. The simulations are based on the recorded rig heave as well as the actual drilling fluid, well design and drill pipe data. Results show that there is a good correlation between simulated and actual measured downhole pressure. The surge & swab simulation software is then used to simulate the same drilling pipe connections using three different techniques and combinations of techniques utilized for improved downhole pressure control: (1) Managed Pressure Drilling (MPD) (2) Managed Pressure Drilling combined with Continuous Circulation System (CCS) and (3) MPD combined with CCS and a downhole choke. Results show that rig heave-induced downhole pressure variations are reduced to a level which is considered acceptable for drilling a well with narrow pressure window for the last two cases, while utilization of backpressure MPD alone is not sufficient. The combination of MPD and CCS reduced surge & swab for two out of three connections. For the third and deepest connection, the surge & swab increased. The largest reduction in significant downhole pressure variations (43-68 % vs. conventional drilling for the three connections) occurs when MPD and CCS are combined with downhole choking. Future work will consist of further developing the surge & swab simulator so that it will be possible to utilize it in well planning and as real-time decision support during drilling operations. The simulator will also be developed to include possibility of simulating various well completion operations such as running casings and liners. A prototype of the downhole choke is currently being tested at the mud loop of the Ullrigg test rig facility in Stavanger, Norway, and the next development phase consists of designing and building a complete downhole tool for testing in a well.

AB  - Abstract Production engineers frequently use back allocation to estimate actual production volumes from wells based on frequent well test data or theoretical calculations using well and reservoir characteristics. PETRONAS executed a centralized production data management system from early days of production to establish a scalable and reliable workprocess among the organization. The production and operation data management system of the field supports data collection, QC, validation and production back allocation as well as production downtime optimization. The new system provides a means to visualize complex networks, verify the production streams, track gathering systems functionality through time and derive the allocation networks. The various downtime coding and quantifications, helped Petronas to quantify the root cause of production shortfalls and optimized the unwanted shut downs. The new system has improved the data quality and reliability and has made the data transparently available to the various stakeholders in the organization. After the new back allocation system became fully operational, Petronas started to realize the following benefits from this successful implementation. Determine the production quantities of each well and reservoir for production accounting. Quality check and approval for the test data before being used for further calculations Ability to allocate production, where accurate measurements are not possible or cost effective. Ability to determine fluid flow quantities through every strategic point in the network The current paper describes the challenges and benefits of the subjected system implementation.

AB  - ABSTRACTThe Underwater Production System (UPS) is a subsea hydrocarbon productionsystem developed jointly by Statoil and Mobil Exploration Norway, through aproject team based in Trondheim, Norway. This paper presents a description ofthe system and the key development activities which led to the project goal ofa fully developed system design.INTRODUCTIONThe UPS was conceived by Statoil in 1984. After a year of in-house development,Statoil approached Mobil with a proposal to pursue the developmentjointly. In September 1986 the two companies staffed and funded the program,which was completed in early 1989.The primary interest of the sponsoring companies was the development of thecapability to safely produce hydrocarbons from fields beyond diver depth, using"wet" technology. In the wake of the recent oil price collapse, addedemphasis was placed on the economic aspects of such a capability. The agreedobjective of the UPS Project was to provide a fully developed design of asystem ready for application in the early 1990's. The feasibility of the systemwas to be verified through system engineering and fabrication/testing ofselected hardware.BASIC DESIGN PHILOSOPHYThe design basis for the UPS was drawn from North Sea experience. Conservativeconditions were selected while avoiding extremes which would have excessivelydriven the design. The principal requirements were as follows:Northern North Sea environmentDistance to field control center: 20 kmDepth: 400 m to guideline limitDesign life: 20 yearsSix well slots, dedicated to either template or satellite trees90,000 bbl fluid/day peak productionMaximum wellhead pressure: 5,000 psiWellhead temperature: 100¬∞ CC2O and H2S serviceMultifunctional inhibitor delivery to each tree.The main aspects of the design philosophy are summarized below (please referto Figure 1 for an overview):Wet, modular designDiverless installation and maintenanceOvertrawlable subsea station, with dropped object protectionThrough flowline (TFL) well maintenance, with back-up wireline accessApplicable ROV for inspection and AssistanceDedicated remotely operated tool (ROT) for component change-outCommon guideline running tool for module change-outPiggable production flowlinesIndividual well test capacityRedundant electrohydraulic multiplex control systemRetrievable control pods, cables and PipingVertical connections for modules, horizontal for flowlines.Existing technology was to be used where possible. New technology was to belimited only to areas where it was deemed essential to achieve the projectobjective.SYSTEM DESCRIPTIONFlow DiagramThe subsea station flow diagram was established to meet the design philosophyand satisfy the design requirements of the system. All active componentssubject to failure were modularized to permit their retrieval. The flow diagramindicates the following equipment (Figure 1).

AB  - ABSTRACT Production Logging for the most part is used to determine the production profile of a well that has multiple zones producing. This production profile is for a single surface production rate and down hole flowing pressure. But much more than that can be gained from the data if the procedure for acquiring data is altered. The additional information gained is productive index, PI, and reservoir pressure for each of the producing layers. This information cannot be determined from a pressure buildup or drawdown test when more than one zone is commingled in a single production string. The production log data, spinner and pressure, are acquired at several different surface production rates. This data is then used to determine the PI and reservoir pressure for each producing layer. This can be done with or without shutting in the well. The PI of a zone determines how much production will be produced for every pound that the pressure is reduced. It also determines the reservoir pressure for each layer. First, the PI is directly related to the deliverability of the zone and also the damage factor skin effect. It is a quick way to determine if a zone is damaged due to drilling, completion, or over time due to production. Second, the reservoir pressure determination of each producing zone will determine if different reservoirs are in communication with each other. It can also determine if parts of the producing intervals are being supported by some type of pressure support, water drive, while other producing intervals are not being supported, only a solution gas drive. Four case histories are presented where the PI and reservoir pressures were determined from production logs. These four examples each determined information about the reservoirs that was not known or not determined from other evaluation methods. This information was then used to improve the recovery factor for each of the wells.

AB  - SPE Members Abstract This paper discusses the state of the art in total production-system analysis useful for economical design of well inflow parameters, sizing of tubulars and accessories, and determining well flow constraints. In addition, capabilities and pitfalls are cited in model applications. To bridge the gap between model developers and users, the structure of a typical computer program is discussed. Field cases are then used to emphasize good geological and engineering practices as opposed to total reliance on model results. Applications of optimization programs to naturally flowing wells, wells on pump, gas-lift wells, and fractured wells are presented, with emphasis on greater technical cooperation. The beam-pump and injection-well examples presented in the paper should be particularly interesting since these areas have seen limited total-system analysis. Major conclusions are that the total system approach can provide important analytical answers to production problems. However, model application production problems. However, model application must be combined with sound technical and economic judgement, and a willingness to cooperate with geologists and engineers from all disciplines, to realize its full potential. Introduction Although well analysis as a total interconnected system has gained in acceptance during the past decade, misconceptions remain due primarily to past decade, misconceptions remain due primarily to poor understanding of model structure, its poor understanding of model structure, its capabilities and deficiencies. Also, poor communication among engineers and geologists in well planning and optimization can lead to less beneficial results. Production system optimization involves engineering and economic analyses of the producing well as a total system consisting of several interconnected components: 1. the reservoir, with an average shut-in pressure, PR, 2. the well completion assembly (gravel-pack screen and perforations), 3. wellbore restrictions (downhole chokes and safety valves), 4. the flow conduit (tubing or annulus, vertical or inclined), 5. wellhead and restrictions (surface chokes, elbows, tees, etc.) 6. the flow line leading to the separator, and 7. the separator itself, characterized by a known pressure, Psp. Pressure drops are converged at a selected node Pressure drops are converged at a selected node from two different directions. Components and nodes can be chosen to study effects of perforation shot density, tubing size, separator pressure, etc. Refer to Fig. 1 for a schematic of a typical well configuration. Refer to Figs. 2 and 3 for example system plots and interpretation guidelines. Before discussing practical model applications and areas of concern, a comprehensive literature review and a typical model structure are presented. One of the earliest and most technical discussions on well production as a total flow system was reported in 1954 by Gilbert. P. 411

AB  - AbstractThis work presents results on the optimization of production systems performance for oil and gas reservoirs. Genetic and Polytope algorithms are used for the nonlinear optimization problem considering appropriate values of several variables like tubing string and wellhead choke diameters, separator pressure and surface pipeline diameter.The model considers several components and different methods to evaluate the pressure drop in each component. The sensitivity of each component of the system can be evaluated. This model includes a mechanistic model to predict the pressure drop due to multiphase flow for any tubing angle with upward and downward flow. The method of splines is used to eliminate the presence of pressure gradient discontinuities in flow pattern boundaries. This property of the model allows us to use optimization algorithms in an efficient manner.Several examples are presented to illustrate the methodology proposed in this work.IntroductionTo achieve an optimum production, an engineer must carefully select the appropriate well and pipeline parameters.Various aspects of production optimization have been addressed in the literature.The first work that considered the use of multivariate optimization techniques to optimize hydrocarbon well performance was presented by Carroll and Horne1. These authors considered a single well problem using a derivative-based method and a polytope algorithm, which is a function comparison method2.Fujii and Horne3 considered a network system of multiple wells connected at the surface, using direct-search methods as the polytope and genetic algorithms. A genetic algorithm has the power to handle highly nonlinear problems and it can be thought as a guided random search engine. Both polytope and genetic methods often show more robust convergence than derivative-based methods in problems where the objective function has a rough surface.Palke and Horne4 also considered a single-well system as Ref. 1 but including gas-lift and phase behavior. These authors used the three optimization techniques, Newton type technique, polytope and genetic algorithms.Wang et.al.5 addressed the problem of simultaneously optimizing the allocation of well rates and lift-gas rates, using a derivative-based optimization method.In Ref. 1 no wellbore parameters were allowed to vary with time. Refs. 3-5 considered time dependent control parameters.Carroll and Horne1 reported that the surface of the objective function is extremely complicated because some flow components in the system include discontinuities or extreme changes in the transition zones of flow patterns. Thus, elimination of discontinuities are very important for derivative-based nonlinear optimization algorithms.Refs. 1, 3, and 4 used several correlations for vertical and horizontal flow-pressure-loss calculations. Wang et. al.5 used a drift-flux model to compute the pressure drop through tubing and pipeline because of its differentiability, which is important for derivative-based optimization problem.As Carroll and Horne1 established, multivariate optimization methods can be successfully applied to optimization of production systems.One purpose of our work is to present a technique to eliminate the discontinuities present in flow pattern boundaries.Fluid properties are represented by a black-oil model. The pressure drop through tubing string and pipeline is modeled by the mechanistic model of Gomez et.al.6 This paper considers both a static and dynamic reservoir conditions. The objective function are daily oil rate, for static reservoir conditions, and cumulative production, where the time variable plays a role. The proposed model considers the coupling of whole wellbore production system.Polytope and genetic algorithms are used because the derivative-based algorithms have some problems with noisy function surfaces.BackgroundTo attain an accurate prediction of the liquid-gas flow characteristics in the wellbore, it is necessary to build a detailed flow pattern model because the liberation of a large amount of gas can significantly affect the overall pressure loss and production.

AB  - Abstract Reservoir management guidelines are an enabler of, production sustainability, assurance to reservoir health and high ultimate recovery. Monitoring the compliance of the field production against the set of reservoir management guidelines is one of the key processes for ADNOC, being a governing body of major U.A.E. hydrocarbon producing fields. With the business need to ramp up production, field maturation, and the associated operational challenges, it is critical for ADNOC to effectively monitor and regulate its field production plans to assure the long-term production sustainability. In this regard, ADNOC has developed a robust framework that is implemented through an automated analytics platform that enables different ADNOC technical teams to effectively monitor and report the compliance status of each hydrocarbon barrel from produced from ADNOC assets. The paper highlights the features of the workflow implemented, the management of change strategy and the business value created. The automated process allows the consolidation of a variety of well, reservoir and field-level data. The analytical platform enables integrated analysis, KPI calculation and interactive visualization. The framework assesses the compliance based on three governing parameters: well technical rate, gas-oil ratio (GOR), and bottom hole flowing pressure. The compliance analysis is carried out on a monthly basis where the monthly back allocated production data for each well is compared with the set of operating guidelines in an automated data analytics and visualization environment. A pragmatic compliance tolerance is considered in the calculations to accommodate the measurement inaccuracies, as well as the operational limitations while allowing flexibility to exclude nonconformity with valid reasons. The overall process is governed through an automated business process management (BPM) platform, which seamlessly regulates the predefined subroutines among different stakeholders to report and track different corrective actions in a timely manner. The framework implementation has strengthened the overall compliance governance process; and has been instrumental to properly manage asset production capacity in a systematic manner. This has subsequently enabled the preparation of a prompt action plan and has improved the operating efficiency of more than 3% within the first six months of implementation, through restoring, compensating and increasing the effective capacity of overall ADNOC Production. The approach has demonstrated great value both in terms of process alignment, as well as from the production assurance standpoint at a country level, and allows the organization to have an established system, which provides: Consistent compliance monitoring standards Minimal subjectivity Complete process governance Quick turnaround time Auditable history The aim of this paper is to publish a stepwise guide for any operators who might be interested to adopt and implement a similar approach to assure the long-term production sustainability and health of their assets.

AB  - Abstract Accurate determination of oil, water, and gas production rates is an important element of oilfield management and optimization. Multiphase flow meters (MPFM) are being accepted more and more for well testing, reservoir management, production allocation, production monitoring, and fiscal metering. In addition to common MPFM applications, this study shows how a multiphase flow meter may be used as a valuable tool to evaluate water production problems of the well by imposing transient flowing conditions to the well and tracking characteristic parameters such as flowrates, water cut and gas oil ratio with the equipment during the test. Representative curves are shown in this study in order to identify some common wellbore problems associated with water conformance. The curves were obtained through numerical reservoir simulation using a number of cases related to the most important problems: water channeling in stratified formations, mechanical wellbore integrity, water conning, and oil-water contact advance. The flowrate at the well should be shortened to a half of the current flowrate with a choke for several hours then, the dimensionless pattern curves of the water cut and gas oil ratio gathered in this study should be matched with the measurement of the MPFM on site in order to characterize the nature of the water problem. This application represents a new tool used to identify the sources of water production. The tool is easy and quick to apply, and complements other analytical techniques being used like diagnostics plots based on production history, water-oil ratio performance and production logs. All of them are used to differentiate between the different mechanisms of water invasion, so that an appropriate treatment may be selected to control undesirable water production. Introduction During the petroleum exploitation, the production of water can come from an aquifer or from injector wells in a waterflooding process. When excess of water production exists, the costs associated to surface facilities, artificial lift systems, corrosion and scale problems increases. Besides, the recovery factor decreases as oil is left behind the displacement front. These factors reduce the economic indicators. The drastic influence of water production must be soon detected and the source of such problem must be identified in order to apply effective and suitable techniques to control this production. The sources of water production can be identified by several techniques. Production logs are one of the most confident techniques. A high level of expertise for logging analysis is required, but is only available in some cases. Analytical techniques such as characterizing the water-oil ratio and production history may be matched with diagnostic plots to distinguish between the different mechanisms causing water invasion. The quality of the production history data is poor in many cases, though. These techniques complement to each other and none of them by itself gives a high level of confidence to the conclusions. It has been reported1 that the analysis of the fluctuating water-oil ratio, WOR, can provide valuable indications to determine the source of water production. It has been suggested to choke the production during short periods with several sizes of orifices and monitor the pressure along with the WOR with a three-phase flow meter to determine the resulting changes in WOR. However, the performance of the WOR for different pressures and rates is not described nor associated to the sources of water production, other than empirical experience.

AB  - Abstract Voidage replacement is a key element in displacement processes, not only for keeping the reservoir pressure at its initial level but also in mitigating surface subsidence in certain fields. Despite its simple definition, it is a complicated process in reservoir management because of uncertainities involved and lack of all required measurements due to economical or technical restrictions. Thus, every single decision parameter and their relative significance in voidage replacement process is important for robust reservoir management. In general, voidage replacement is achieved where injection is based on production. This study investigates the case of triggers where the production rate at the bottom hole conditions is predicated on the bottom hole flowing conditions or reservoir gas injection rate. A full-physics commercial reservoir simulator is coupled with robust optimization software, where a miscible flood operation is modeled with a group bottom hole flowing target coupled with voidage replacement gas and water injection targets. The simulation results of this realistic case is presented in a way to show the relative significance of each operational parameter, which is outlined with tornado charts to serve as a guide in decision making in efficient reservoir management where voidage replacement is a crucial component. It is observed that triggers help to better manage voidage replacement, especially in large reservoirs where reservoir surveillance is a challenge due to number of wells and patterns. The results can be scaled up to different size of reservoirs and patterns with similar recovery processes. This study scrutinizes the feasibility of a reversal of the typical scenario where injection is based on production. Thus, it serves as a useful and realistic example for efficient reservoir management through optimization of voidage replacement through triggers for production rate.

AB  - Abstract This paper describes the importance of pressure transient analysis (PTA) for reservoir surveillance and production optimization of a giant carbonate field during the early stages of production. Multiple field examples are provided which illustrate an improved understanding of well behavior and reservoir response. The Kashagan field operational procedures during start-up allowed for numerous shut-in and build-up opportunities which lasted from a few hours to several days. The time lapse analysis of short build-ups combined with pressure and temperature data was applied to monitor well performance, identify opportunities for productivity improvement and assess the effectiveness of acid stimulation. It was also utilized to improve the allocation process for production. Extended buildup tests were conducted to evaluate reservoir properties and identify unexpected well / reservoir responses. Results from multiple buildup analysis in individual wells were critical to evaluate well performance behavior during early production. The time lapse analysis of the build-up data was able to confirm changing downhole conditions. Furthermore, continuous monitoring was helpful in characterizing the nature of the changes and identifying opportunities for improving well performance. Additionally, routine pressure transient analysis helped to resolve challenges faced by the surveillance team with production allocation. Reservoir parameters determined by pressure transient analysis improved understanding reservoir behavior in various areas of the field and helped to detect outlying well behavior. As a result, the collected and analyzed pressure transient data has demonstrated its importance as an integral component of reservoir surveillance and production optimization. This paper presents real field examples of pressure transient analysis in a giant carbonate field along with their ability to improve well performance and to better understand the reservoir response. It also describes the challenges and learnings from production pressure transient analysis data which can be useful for other practicing engineers who might face similar issues.

AB  - Abstract The main objective of this paper is to present a model based integration platform to perform 60+ oil wells optimization in PETROBRAS Urucu field (Solim√µes Basin, Amazon Rain Forest), while honoring operational constraints on wells, production separators, pipelines, and total field gas processing capacity. The solution was built based on current technologies of modeling gas and water coning in the high-permeability reservoirs of Urucu, including detailed 3D finite-difference well models automatically history matched to production data, and empirical models based on fundamental flow theory. The well models have been integrated into a prototype solution to simultaneously solve for all 60+ optimal well rate controls. The optimization scheme should determine the optimum setting of well control (e.g. liquid rate) of all the wells in the field and advise on production management of each individual well. The developed concept is presented in the paper. Another important development presented is a virtual metering modeling that estimates production rate of each well, based on real time data of pressure and temperature measurements on wellhead. The Urucu field optimization strategy relies intensively on the engineering work related to process and technology. An international and multidisciplinary group including academic collaboration was established to compose the various knowledge needed to embrace the challenge. 1. Urucu Production field The Urucu field is located in a remote region of primary rainforest 650 km southwest of Manaus in the heartland of the Brazilian Amazon. Petrobras started its production activities in Urucu after the discovery of a significant reserve of oil and natural gas in 1986. The field consists of three reservoirs called "River Urucu?? (RUC), "East of Urucu?? (LUC), and "Southeast of Urucu?? (SUC). The field has more than 60 production wells and more than 20 injection wells flowing to several manifolds, as depicted in the flowchart in Figure 1. The crude produced in Urucu has average oil gravity of 45 oAPI and GOR ranging from 500 to 5000 m3/m3. Gas expansion is the primary recovery mechanism. Typical field flow rates are 50.000 bpd and 10.5 million Nm¬≥/day of natural gas, with re-injection of 8 million Nm¬≥/day of processed gas as secondary recovery mechanism. The large range of GOR in the field is due to gas coning behavior. LUC field is the main oil producer and has rate constraint in the gas flowline to LPG "Polo Arara?? plant. Therefore, to minimize field GOR is a main subject to maximize oil production. 2. Integrated and Optimization Concepts Several reservoir and well management techniques to exploit and enhance oil field life cycle have already been discussed in literature, T. Babadagli (2005) gives an extended bibliography on reservoir area.1 Production fields that already went on primary depletion face secondary/tertiary recovery projects. Infill horizontal drilling is a natural phase of mature field development. The final stage selects an EOR strategy fitted for the specific production scenario.

AB  - A concept is presented for producing a 40,000-BOPD offshore field in 260 ft of water in the North Sea. The system uses a semisubmersible drilling rig converted to a floating production platform. Design considerations of the production riser system and subsea installations are described. Introduction Hamilton Brothers Oil and Gas Ltd. is currently engaged in producing the Argyll field in the United Kingdom sector of the North Sea. The field lies in Block 30/24, 190 miles southeast of Aberdeen, Scotland, and 25 miles southeast of Phillips Petroleum Co.'s Ekofisk field. The field was discovered in Aug. 1971 and was confirmed in 1972. It has been developed using a unique offshore production facility based on a semisubmersible drilling rig converted to a production platform. This is connected to sea-bed installations by a platform. This is connected to sea-bed installations by a production riser developed by Hamilton Brothers for production riser developed by Hamilton Brothers for this application. Field Data The Argyll field is one of the few Permian fields so far discovered in the North Sea. The main productive zone is a Zechstein dolomite varying in thickness from 30 to 100 ft. It is a highly fractured, vugular formation directly underlain by a Rotliegendes sandstone similar to those encountered in the Southern gas fields. The Zechstein crude is 38 degrees API gravity, and the Rotliegendes is slightly lower at 34 degrees. Sulphur content in the field is around 0.25 percent and wax content averages 6 percent. Depending on the particular well, GOR's range between 150 and 300 scf/bbl The Argyll field appears to be a relatively small field that may be drained by a few wells. From evidence of the logs, it is considered probable that good communication exists between the probable that good communication exists between the sandstone and dolomite. Drillstem testing using restricted chokes has indicated prolific flow rates and good pressure recovery on shut-in. It was planned to produce four wells, perforated in the dolomite interval produce four wells, perforated in the dolomite interval only, and to monitor well behavior closely. Average well productivity of at least 10,000 BOPD was anticipated. Because of the relative complexity of the Argyll geology it has not been possible to predict how the field will produce. Nor, in fact, has the full reserve potential of the area been established. These considerations led Hamilton Brothers to choose a test production facility for the initial phase of development of the Argyll field. The program was designed to place the field in production with minimum investment and to yield reservoir information required to determine future development policy. At the same time, this production test will yield sufficient revenue to assure profitable initial operation of the field. Test Production Facility The corrupt of using a semisubmersible drilling vessel as a production platform evolved logically. The successful operation by Phillips at the Ekofisk field set the pattern of development in the Argyll field. JPT P. 475

AB  - Abstract The high oil prices of the last five years have motivated operators to unveil less historically attractive hydrocarbon resources and to optimize production operations from existing fields. In fact, many operators of brown and mature fields around the globe plan increases in production of more than 100% during the next five years. Optimizing production operations may ‚Äî with the minimum effort‚Äî involve identifying opportunities for production increases from reservoirs, from individual wells, and from surface equipment. In addition, to sustain lean operations, production operations will require constant review of processes, management systems, adaptation of people, and applications of smart technology. Often, decisions must be made despite uncertainties of well performance, subsurface response, equipment failure rates, and downstream demands. The heterogeneity of information and the complexity of current assets imply an iterative approach to identify viable opportunities. Opportunities require management of risk and uncertainty. To accomplish such a challenging goal, it is necessary to estimate new capital investments for wells and facilities while considering both reservoir uncertainties and multiple scenarios for development. New capital investments are intended to increase the economic value of daily production operations. We present a structured methodology for integrating reservoir forecasts with wells and with surface facilities and operational issues. We also present several case-studies. Operational issues include well performance, subsurface response, equipment failure rate, and downstream demands. The methodology considers the integration of reservoir production uncertainty, well performance, drilling schedule compliance, workover success, and varying surface facility variables, such as availability, uptime, and capacities. Introduction In the past, multiple oilfield disciplines have been treated and considered as silos. We present a rationale for considering an integrated effort and for considering production operations as the common interface for all disciplines. Current Integration Challenges. The effort to successfully integrate data and processes in the value chain for oilfield production operations has many challenges. By viewing these challenges as sources of uncertainty, we can begin to understand their impact on decisions to effectively optimize production and forecast production and reserves. The widespread risk involved here is that people and systems are not following or supporting optimal processes that will deliver critical data for integration. People/Organizational Challenges. There are a variety of people and organizational challenges. Engineering and operations personnel are increasingly absorbed with day to day activities. The pressure to collect data and deliver daily reports tends to intensify compartmentalized behavior and to discourage information flow between key processes that should be better integrated. As an example, data on the availability of injection gas from compression facilities may not be integrated with the anticipated needs and performance of injection and producing wells and with the characterization of a reservoir. Work force demographics and dynamics also present challenges to integration. As an example, entire asset teams with their own processes and tools frequently merge with a new, parent operating company. The operating company must then assimilate these teams into their organizational structure via a cumbersome balance of centralized and distributed authority ‚Äî an assimilation process that is further aggravated by asset-level, profit-loss accountability and authority. One of the key pieces of data from recent studies indicates that the average experience level for operations, production and reservoir engineering resources is about 15-20 years. These statistics are consistent with the "Big Crew Change?? phenomenon that the oil & gas industry has anticipated. ¬†Unfortunately, a large percentage of expert professionals will soon retire, and their companies have not yet been fully able to institutionalize or transfer their knowledge. This perceived shortcoming also exemplifies the challenge of people/organization difficulties.

AB  - This paper describes the solution formulation that was put in place in order to maximize oil production on fields with complex optimization spaces. The fields considered presented an infinite combination of control settings that could be used to regulate production. As such, the process by which each problem is broken down into elements that can be easily understood and combined, shows the potential of a technique referred to as "Nested Optimization" in the improvement of production in virtually any field around the world. The process by which optimization is applied in practice is obviously important, as different approaches to the maximization of production may lead to solutions with various levels of robustness, efficiency and practical application in the field. The workflow presented achieves the need from any operator to distinguish between these approaches and select the one that offers maximum production, while at the same time being able to cope with the ever changing nature of field reality from a flow assurance perspective. The fields considered have multiple constraints that operators have to adhere to, such as erosional velocity limits, integrity limits and others. Controls typically relate to chokes on every well along with such parameters as the speed of compressors that feed export pipelines with associated gas. Routing of wells, risers and other systems at surface is yet another control that often needs to be considered. As such, a variety of optimizers were applied, each dealing with a subset of the complete problem. The boundary conditions of each optimization problem in the nested approach were dynamically controlled by higher level optimizers, so that the overall solution is fully consistent. Formulating the solution in a way that allowed multiple optimizers to work together in a nested fashion meant that a number of very significant optimisation opportunities could be identified. Generally, the implementation of these opportunities would not require significant additional capital expenditure. The paper discusses the application of Nested Optimization as well as how this can be automatically coupled to an automated quality control process. Workflows that transform the results of the optimizers into settings that operators can easily follow have been implemented. The solution also shows how steady state and transient models can be linked to the quality control of the pipeline stability results. The linking of optimization results to their application in the field means that operators can be confident of a safe implementation of the recommendations made.

AB  - AbstractThe Troika Subsea Production System is located in the Green Canyon Area of the Gulf of Mexico, 150 miles offshore and in 2700 feet of water. Featuring an eight-well subsea manifold with five wells installed initially, Troika is designed to produce 80-100,000 barrels of oil per day to its host platform located 14 miles away in 1350 feet of water. Concern about paraffin and hydrates necessitated considerable analysis, which in turn pointed to the need to insulate the trees, manifold, jumpers, and flowlines. Key features of the Troika development are described in this paper.IntroductionThe Troika development is an oil field located 150 miles offshore Louisiana in the Green Canyon area of the Gulf of Mexico. Designated as the Green Canyon 244 Unit, which was formed in June, 1993, the development includes Green Canyon blocks 200, 201, 244, and 245 (Fig. 1). Troika is owned equally by BP, Shell, and Marathon, with BP serving as the designated operator. Water depth at the development site is 2700 feet. Troika features an eight slot subsea manifold with five wells installed initially (Fig. 2). The compact size of the subsea manifold permitted its installation in a novel manner using only a supply boat and the drilling rig. The Troika wells are non-TFL and have a 10,000 psi pressure rating. Production from Troika is processed at Shell's Bullwinkle platform located 14 miles away in 1350 feet of water on Green Canyon block 65. Concern about the potential to form hydrates and paraffin was a key factor in formulating the design and operating plan for the subsea production system. As a result, the trees, jumpers, manifold, and flowlines are all insulated to minimize heat loss during production, as well as to extend reaction time to manage hydrate formation potential following a shut-in. Methods used to insulate the trees, manifold, and jumpers were novel and innovative. Insulated tubing was installed in one well to facilitate start-up. Troika represents the longest multi-phase subsea tie-back system in the Gulf of Mexico. First production from Troika was successfully achieved approximately 39 months after discovery further demonstrating industry's ability to deliver fast-track development schedules in deepwater. While this paper is intended to provide an overview of the Troika project, further details may be found in the various companion papers listed in the Reference section.Development HistoryProductive hydrocarbons were discovered at Troika in June 1994 when Marathon drilled the Green Canyon 244-1 well and found 250 feet of net oil pay in the primary S-10 reservoir. In the summer of 1995, Marathon further tested and defined the lateral and vertical continuity of the S-10 reservoir by drilling the Green Canyon 200-1 appraisal well. A second appraisal well, Green Canyon 245-1, was drilled in September, 1995 and discovered a separate, but much smaller, reservoir in a section of the Unit designated as Area 2. Both appraisal wells were temporarily abandoned. During 1995 tradeoff studies were conducted to determine a development approach for Troika, with the two leading candidate systems being a subsea tie-back and a floating production system, the latter featuring a converted drilling rig. The subsea tie-back to Shell's Bullwinkle platform was ultimately selected as it provided the most cost-effective solution based on NPV and capex utilization.

AB  - Abstract The objective of this work is to further explore the potential application of Machine Learning algorithms in production prediction and ultimate recovery. Intelligent Machine Learning Approaches such as Gradient Boosted Trees (GBT), Adaboost, and Support Vector Regressor (SVR) are applied to detect the most important features contributing to cumulative production prediction within the first 12 producing months. The models are applied on a data set composed of 5 wells in the Volve field in the North Sea. The collected data was then filtered and used to structure and train the different Regression algorithms and fine tune the appropriate hyperparameters. The different models were All models were evaluated by measuring the Mean Absolute Error (MAE). The generalization and precision performance of the proposed models are established by comparing the forecasted outcome after cross validation with field data. The optimized model can predict production response with high accuracy. The data-fitting process comprises of splitting the data into training using 70% of the data set, 15% validation, and 15% testing. Constructing a regression model on the training set and validating it with the test set. Recurrent application of a "cross-validation" process produces important information concerning the robustness of any regression-modeling method. Six parameters were considered as input factors to build the model. Factors affecting production prediction included on stream hours, average choke size, bore oil volume, bore gas volume, bore water volume, average wellhead pressure were used as input. The outcome showed that the developed model provided better prediction compared to analytical models with a 11.71% MAE prediction for SVR. This novel data mining application could be trained on any dataset to help predict future production performance at any conditions in any given scenario.

AB  - Abstract The operational efficiency in drilling and completing unconventional reservoirs has made impressive progress in the past few years. However, modeling the physics of reservoir production, while making progress, still requires substantial time and resources making it applicable only on a small fraction of wells. In this paper, we propose and illustrate use of a novel generation hybrid model that enable viable application on every well. In addition, it provides a practical tool to simulate as many what-if scenarios as needed to identify best solutions and to assess validity of proposed interpretation techniques. Following a brief review of the model validation and the effect of angle between fracture planes and well axis, several examples are presented to assess the impact of many factors including, flow convergence toward the wellbore, fracture-wellbore connection impairment and fracture complexity. Fracture complexity causes significant production increase during the early years of production that decreases with time but can significantly improve the return on investment. The impact on production of flow convergence and that of the fracture-wellbore connection damage is illustrated and a diagnosis method is proposed. Last, a field example history match is presented.

AB  - Abstract As part of the long tradition of innovative production growth and enhancement projects in the Greater Ekofisk Area, in 2004 ConocoPhillips Norway AS (COPNo) implemented the Onshore Operations Centre (OOC). The OOC facilitates improved collaborative working processes that optimise production and streamline operations through more proactive use of both field equipment and software tools. This paper describes the specification, development and implementation of the online production optimisation software used in this project.¬† This software was provided and developed by EPS Ltd, a Weatherford company, in collaboration with COPNo. Specification of the system started in 2005, based on years of prior experience with network production modelling tools in the Ekofisk area, to simulate and optimise production from the reservoir to the export meter. The system is designed to fully utilise the OOC's continuous measurement and recording systems, throughout the entire production and process network. This production optimisation system aims to complement the existing informational displays and charts by the calibration and optimisation of complete network models several times a day. The optimisation results and comparison with real-time data and operating objectives are made available to users through a web interface so that they can be used by the operator and partner company staff at any location. Models of the wells and production/process network have been developed, following extensive discussions with all relevant disciplines, to ensure that these models can resolve the regular questions faced by the Greater Ekofisk operations teams. In addition to the daily simulation and optimisation scenarios run by the full, online system, the constituent parts of the full model can be also run offline to help evaluate exceptional production issues. The operator is experiencing benefits in two main categories firstly by identification of production problems with wells or plant that prevent the system from achieving target production and secondly by having continuously updated production scenarios available on which planning decisions can be based. These results will be discussed, with many examples. Introduction The Ekofisk field is located in the Southern North Sea in Norwegian production license PL018, operated by ConocoPhillips and was discovered in 1969. The ConocoPhillips Group includes Total E&P Norge, Eni Norge, StatoilHydro and Petoro and operates several other fields within this license including Eldfisk, Embla and Tor.¬† Current production from the 150 natural flow and gas-lifted development wells in these fields is over 300,000 barrels of oil with over 300 MMSCF/D of associated gas. The Ekofisk field and the Eldfisk field are also currently being waterflooded (Hermansen 2002) with a total injection rate of approximately 600,000 barrels of water per day. Production from the license block fields is commingled and processed on a centrally located facility, Ekofisk J, and products exported to the market through an oil pipeline to Teeside, UK and a gas pipeline to Emden, Germany. The production network modelled in this project, including the main facility and pipeline system, is shown in figure 1. The Ekofisk A, B, C, M, X, Eldfisk A, B, Tor and Embla jackets all support production wells with limited separation facilities. The other jackets support compressor and process facilities.

AB  - Abstract Saudi Aramco's drilling strategy witnessed a change in the last few years by drilling horizontal and extended reach maximum reservoir contact (MRC) wells. One of the objectives behind this strategy is to improve the well productivity by maximizing oil production and minimizing water production. The paper will demonstrate the challenges and successes of reducing produced water by using smart completions and how multiphase flow meters (MPFM) helped in getting better results to allow faster decision making. In one of the challenging areas in Ghawar field where the water will reach the wellbore much faster via the reservoir's fractures. Using the smart completion with the conventional rate testing (the plant's testing facility) required longer time to reach the best possible setting for the downhole flow control valves to achieve the optimum flow rate. Using the combination of smart completion and portable MPFM (Multiphase Flow Meter), resulted in reducing the water cut (WC) form 20% to 0% maintaining the same required average oil rate (Fig. 1), and enabled better reservoir management. The results from this experience, as will as other experiences, have been utilized in a recent major increment in the Ghawar field that was mainly developed using multilateral MRC wells equipped with downhole smart completions and surface MPFMs. Introduction The well is located in an area surrounded by reservoir's faults and fractures; it was drilled as a multi-lateral oil producer with four laterals, and planned to be completed with smart completion (Fig.2) which consist of one Permanent DownHole pressure & temperature Monitoring System (PDHMS)and three hydraulic flow control valves (Fig.3) with three packers (Fig.4). This completion was not run due to due to some operational problems and the well was completed with conventional completion consisting of one packer, 4- 1/2" tailpipe and 7" tubing and PDHMS. To reduce the WC, the well was produced at high rates (Fig.5). After one year of production, the well was worked over, the conventional completion was pulled out of hole and a smart completion system was run successfully as originally planned.

AB  - Abstract The ConocoPhillips Alpine facility, on the Alaskan North Slope, has experienced slugging problems severe enough to trip the high-high inlet separator level, causing frequent plant shutdowns, and loss of production of 110 kbbl/d.¬† A slugging study was commissioned to investigate the cause of the existing CD-2 pipeline slugging, and possible mitigation procedures, which could alleviate and/or eliminate slugging.¬† Further, the Alpine expansion called for an additional two pipelines (CD-3 and CD-4) to be brought into Alpine inlet separator.¬† Slugging mechanism and instability analysis were performed. The instability is due to combination of its low flow rate, overly-sized pipeline ID and unfavorable pipeline profile.¬† Flow pattern transition exists at the low spots and liquid accumulates and blocks the flow. In the low pressure system, once gas blows out and system pressure drops, the pipeline inlet gas increases velocity and picks up a new hydrodynamic slug.¬† This slug moves through the road crossing and the pipe rack riser, becoming a long slug which arrives at the separator. In this study, a slug-tracking model with separator gas/liquid PID controllers was built to reproduce the field SCADA data.¬† A remarkably good match of pressure variations, slugging frequency and liquid level was achieved.¬† A sensitivity study was performed to investigate the effective and practical ways to suppress slugging in the existing CD-1 and CD-2 pipeline.¬† Finally, a combined control was recommended by installing a by-pass control valve at the butterfly valve location.¬† The by-pass inlet control valve before the separator acquires separator liquid level signal, and actuates when the separator liquid level exceeds the set value.¬† This significantly reduces slugging effect on separator performance. The slugging model and results based on the existing CD-2 pipeline were applied to the future expanded CD-3 and CD-4 pipeline study.¬† Some conclusions were drawn from the slugging behavior. Introduction In many oil and gas developments with multiphase flowlines, production instability due to slugging is a major flow assurance concern. Slugging initiates oscillations, puts excessive demands upon the separation and operation, and increases the wear and tear of equipment.¬† Large liquid surges can cause poor performance, separator shut down, high pressure trips, or flaring. Slugging can be characterized by periodical change of pressure and gas/liquid flow.¬† The slugging severity depends on slugging types.¬† There are three types of slugging: Hydrodynamic slugs: a feature of the slug flow regime where slugs are continuously formed due to instability of waves at certain gas-liquid flow rates. Generally, hydrodynamic slugs do not exceed 20 times of pipe diameters if there is no obvious inclination change.¬† Operationally induced surges: generated by changing the flow conditions from one steady state to another, such as restart, flow rate ramp-up or pigging operations.¬† The generated liquid surge can upset the system. Terrain induced slugs: also called severe slugs, caused by accumulation and periodic purging of liquid in flowline dips at low flow rates;

AB  - Abstract This paper presents the results of a computer study which leads to the optimum design of a production system for flowing wells subjected to a natural production system for flowing wells subjected to a natural water drive. The results presented consist of a series of graphs which are derived from an analysis of the inflow performance relationships, vertical lift performance, choke performance, horizontal flow performance, and the thermodynamic conditions of the surface conditioning equipment such as separator and flow lines. The Hagedorn and Brown correlations and the Beggs and Brill correlations are utilized to determine pressure drop for vertical lift and horizontal flow performance for multiphase flow. Using these correlations and assuming a flow rate and starting from the separator, pressure losses are calculated along the flowline to the wellhead, across the choke, and down the tubing to the tubing intake. Output from the analysis results in an optimized system design which maximizes production for a set of reservoir conditions and surface constraints. An example well problem are presented which demonstrate the applicability and versatility of the computer analysis. An analysis is also presented to assess the sensitivity of various parameters upon well performance. Such parameters as flowline size, separator temperature and pressure, choke size, tubing size, water oil ratio, gas oil ratio, productivity index, oil gravity and fluid slippage are productivity index, oil gravity and fluid slippage are considered in the sensitivity analysis. The results of this analysis and the data presented provides the production engineer with a presented provides the production engineer with a technique for designing a system which will optimize production from a given well. The approach is production from a given well. The approach is general in that the outputs from the analysis provides the engineer with a set of curves and graphs to assist in making a final decision concerning a specific well or group of wells. Introduction Considerable information has been published concerning the analysis and design of production systems for oil and gas wells. However, much of this information appears to be used sparingly since a great deal of time and effort must be expended in order to use it effectively. The purpose of this paper is to present a methodology inherent in a computer program present a methodology inherent in a computer program developed to provide the engineer a tool for performing analysis and design synthesis in order to arrive performing analysis and design synthesis in order to arrive at an optimum production system for a well. The complete details including the computer code is given in reference 1 and only a summary of the results are presented in this paper. It is recognized that presented in this paper. It is recognized that several petroleum companies or independent consulting firms may have similar in-house capabilities as are described in this paper but to the authors knowledge a complete description including a computer code has not been made available to the industry. In addition, the integration of generalized inflow performance analysis, vertical multiphase flow, choke performance, flow line conditions has yet to appear in the literature in a systematic manner. The best known source of information concerning all these aspects can be found in reference 2 and 3. However, neither of these references presents a complete computer optimization scheme for analyzing total well performance. In order to evaluate the performance of a naturally flowing well it is necessary to divide the performance into three distinct stages, which are performance into three distinct stages, which are studied separately and finally linked together in order to efficiently evaluate the overall performance of a given well. The three principle stages are inflow performance, vertical multiphase flow, and horizontal performance, vertical multiphase flow, and horizontal multiphase flow. Inherent within these three stages are the surface choke performance and surface facility constraints. Hence, the main purpose of this paper is to present a logical methodology to design the initial production system for a flowing well and to reasonable predict its future performance. These operations are 1. Predict the optimum flowrate for specific reservoir conditions. P. 297

AB  - Abstract In E&P, from asset managers to front end operations staff, there is a common problem - we are data rich, but information poor.¬†In particular, timely well-by-well production surveillance and allocation often remains a problem.¬† Gathering data, even real time data, from wells and facilities hasn't been an issue, but validating the data and relating this data to individual well production rates in a coherent, consistent and timely manner and then taking prompt action, is a challenge.¬†Traditional routine well testing simply provides a series of snap-shots of a well's performance, which may or may not reflect the production during the intervening period.¬†Errors are typically spread across the wells and reservoirs through a reconciliation process comparing estimated well productions and actual metered sales on a weekly or monthly basis. This paper describes the development and application of a new tool, FieldWare* PRODUCTION UNIVERSE * (PU), which estimates real time well production rates from simple field measurements and provides online reconciliation against bulk measurements and export meters.¬†The novel aspect of the technique is that it uses dynamic, data-driven models to describe the production process, together with a new well test methodology for capturing the data to build the initial models. Well tests include a deliberate disturbance to the production to determine the dynamic characteristics of a well.¬†The models do not require underlying physical or process models, predetermined multiphase flow correlations, compositional data or well/piping/equipment details.¬†This has made the models quick to set-up and easy to maintain. FieldWare PRODUCTION UNIVERSE is now fully operational and used for well-by-well production surveillance and monitoring at many of Shell's production facilities worldwide, both onshore and offshore.¬†The application of PU has helped increase production through improved monitoring, resolved hydrocarbon allocation problems through real time reconciliation, allowed an increase in time between well tests and reduced travel to field locations.¬† The availability of real time production data is a key enabler for future smart optimization and intelligent diagnostics.¬†PU is a foundation element for Shell's Smart Fields initiative.¬† Introduction This paper is intended to introduce the Shell's PRODUCTION UNIVERSE project at a high level and share some of the experiences and findings of the first phase of the development.¬†In particular, we wish to highlight the PU application as an example of the innovative synthesis of oil and gas operational and technical expertise and state of the art mathematical techniques. Historically the oil and gas production industry has relied on traditional methods for individual well production flow monitoring and surveillance.¬†This provides periodic well test information using test separators or multiphase meters, sometimes supplemented with real time pressure and temperature data gathered from the well between tests.¬† Since the test separators / multiphase meters are normally shared among a number of wells, the actual performance of a well is only measured periodically or on demand.¬†Typically around 2% of the well monthly production is measured by well testing.¬†Thus the surveillance of individual wells is a periodic discontinuous process.¬† This is not optimal, as many well problems are not detected until a well is re-tested.¬†Well test conditions may be very different from actual operating conditions.¬† This conventional surveillance and monitoring methodology is premised on the concept that oil and gas production systems were largely steady state and these snap shots in time were adequate to manage the business.¬†However in many fields, well performance and plant-operating conditions can change rapidly and there is value in closer and more regular well production surveillance.¬† Furthermore when a field enters a period of rapid production decline, it requires a higher level of attention and higher frequency of data gathering. The inadequacy of the "snap shot" paradigm then becomes even more pronounced.

AB  - Abstract Although various logging challenges in highly deviated and horizontal wells have been addressed in many previous studies, only a few investigations have focused on emulsion diagnosis and multiphase production log (MPL) solutions in such difficult conditions. The emulsion discussed in this paper is water-in-oil emulsion, in which water is present in the form of droplets dispersed in oil. This is generally expected to happen in a high velocity, turbulent flow regime, and in a low density contrast between oil and water. The impact of water emulsion is the inability to identify and quantify water entries using the standard holdup measurement arrays, because the water droplets have the same conductivity as oil and travel at the same velocity as oil, regardless of well deviation. A novel workflow and methodology were established for successful diagnosis of this emulsion downhole to be able to perform inflow profiling for these problematic wells, using information from different sources of data: multiphase production logging tool (MPLT), pulsed neutron logging tool (PNLT), and surface fluid sampling. The workflow includes job preparation, real-time monitoring during logging operation, and post-job data interpretation. The optimized workflow was applied to field examples for successful diagnosis of the emulsion and the integrated logging solution to overcome this challenge in horizontal wells. This led to the determination, with high confidence, of the downhole flow profile and to the accurate quantitative identification of the source of water production. The information can then be used to plan suitable well intervention, without which the reservoir and/or field development could not be optimized.

AB  - Abstract Since 1985 Bass Strait oil production has declined by over 100 KSTB/D (16 ML/d) to an average of 364 kSTB/D (58 ML/d) in 1988. To mitigate this decline Esso Australia has undertaken a coordinated program aimed at realizing the full production potential of existing reserves and facilities. This program centres on three fronts; major projects such as gas lift and waterhandling, a workover program and the removal of facility constraints. Over the next 4 years this rate enhancement activity is currently forecast to offset declining production rates by an average of 60 kSTB/D (10 ML/d). Currently over 60% of available oil wells are capable of being gas lifted. including two wells with average angles in excess of 70 degrees, and it is planned to increase this number to over 75% in the near term. The strong water drive characteristics of Bass Strait reservoirs has resulted in increased formation water production. Waterhandling facilities have been installed to maximize production levels. Current waterhandling capacity production levels. Current waterhandling capacity is around 300 kSTB/D (48 ML/d) with half being achieved through use of hydrocyclones which provide improved portability and operating flexibility compared with conventional waterhandling equipment. Since mid 1987 an average of over 4 workovers per month have been completed in an intensive program to achieve the full potential from all wells. This has been achieved through the use of alternative options to the conventional tubing pull workovers of the past. Extensive use has been made of coil tubing past. Extensive use has been made of coil tubing units (CTU), concentric rigs and a jack-up rig instead of conventional platform rigs, thus reducing costs and returning wells to production faster. Platform facilities have been optimize through Platform facilities have been optimize through close liaison between operations and engineering personnel to locate and remove production personnel to locate and remove production constraints where possible. Integration of facilities for new developments has allowed production from existing reservoirs to be increased. production from existing reservoirs to be increased Introduction The Gippsland Basin lies offshore South Eastern Australia and contains the largest known reserves of oil in Australia, plus substantial reserves of gas. Gas was first discovered by Esso and BHP in 1965 and the first production platforms were started-up in Bass Strait in 1969. Since then 14 platforms have been installed and about 2.5 billion barrels (400 ML) of oil, 400 million barrels (64 ML) of LPG and 2.8 trillion cubic feet (100,000 Mm3) of gas has been produced. Figure 1 illustrates Gippsland's oil production history. Production peaked in 1985 at an annual average rate of nearly 500 kSTB/D (80 ML/d) and has been steadily declining since then. Production from the remaining undeveloped reserves will partially offset this decline but they are relatively small reservoirs and difficult to develop economically. Figure 2 shows the location of the major producing fields in Bass Strait. Marlin, Snapper and Barracouta are predominantly gas fields and the remainder are oil fields, the largest being Kingfish, Halibut, Mackerel, Fortescue and Cobia. Since the early 1980's in particular, there has been considerable effort devoted to finding ways to optimise production from our aging reservoirs. The primary emphasis has been on gas lift and offshore primary emphasis has been on gas lift and offshore waterhandling facilities, and workovers. Many new and innovative techniques have been successfully introduced in recent years. P. 17

AB  - Summary. Production-systems analysis has been in use for many years to design completion configurations on the basis of an expected reservoir capacity. The most common equations used for the reservoir calculations are for steady-state radial flow. Most hydraulically fractured wells require the use of an unsteady-state production simulator to predict the higher flow rates associated with the stimulated well. These high flow rates may present problems with excessive pressure drops through production tubing designed for radial-flow production. Therefore, the unsteady-state nature of fractured-well production precludes the use of steady-state radial-flow inflow performance relationships (IPR's) to calculate reservoir performance. An accurate prediction of fractured-well production must be made to design the most economically efficient production configuration. It has been suggested in the literature that a normalized reference curve can be used to generate the IPR's necessary for production-systems analysis. However, this work shows that the reference curve for fractured-well response becomes time-dependent when reservoir boundaries are considered. A general approach for constructing IPR curves is presented, and the use of an unsteady-state fractured-well-production simulator coupled with the production-systems-analysis approach is described. A field case demonstrates the application of this method to fractured wells. IntroductionProduction-systems analysis has been used for many years to design completion configurations on the basis of an expected reservoir capacity. Often called nodal-systems analysis, this approach has been applied to the analysis of electrical circuits and pipeline systems. Gilbert was one of the first to propose the application of the systems-analysis approach to well producing systems. A typical producing system includes many components where there is a potential for pressure drops to occur. As the well configuration becomes more complex, the potential for large total pressure drops within the system increases. Fig. 1 presents a schematic of a producing configuration and possible pressure drops through the system. It is the objective of production-systems analysis to optimize the well configuration for maximum production capacity. This is accomplished by dividing the system at some point or node and calculating pressure drops within each component. System components upstream of the node are commonly referred to as the inflow; those downstream of the node are referred to as the outflow. Relationships between pressure drop and flow rate must exist for each component. Pressure drops for various flow rates are calculated for both inflow and outflow sections. Two conditions are necessary for production systems analysis: (1) flow into the node must equal flow out of the node and (2) only a single pressure can exist at the node for a given flow rate. With these two conditions satisfied, flow capacity of the entire system can be determined. This is commonly achieved by plotting node pressure vs. flow rate for both inflow and outflow; the intersection of inflow and outflow curves is the system flow capacity. This is illustrated in Fig. 2. The effect of a change in any of the components can be investigated by recalculating either the inflow or outflow curve, depending on the location of the component to be changed. For example, if the component is located in the outflow section, the outflow curve is recalculated; however, the inflow curve remains unchanged. Thus, the production-systems-analysis approach can be used to evaluate existing producing systems and to aid in the design of future well configurations. Many examples illustrating the application of the production-systems-analysis technique exist in the literature. To apply the systems-analysis approach to a certain well configuration. relationships or models must be available for determining the pressure drop as a function of flow rate for each component considered. For calculation purposes, the well configuration can be separated into several sections or modules, each containing several components. For example, the producing system shown in Fig. 1 can be separated into three general sections: flowline, well, and reservoir. Each of these sections may be composed of one or more components. For example, the well module may consist of a tubing string composed of several different sizes, a restriction within the tubing near the bottom of the hole, and possibly a safety valve that also introduces a flow restriction. Models that relate pressure drop to flow rate within a component are used to calculate the total pressure drop at a given flow rate for each section. Correlations for multiphase flow through pipelines are available in the literature and are useful in determining pressure drops through tubing and flowline components of the well system. Correlations commonly used for calculating pressure drop through a horizontal pipeline include Refs. 7 through 10. Various pressure-drop correlations are available for flow through the vertical tubing of a well. Pressure-drop relationships for flowline and tubing sections have been in use for many years and are generally the accepted models for flow through pipes. Selection of one correlation over another depends on specific well conditions. The reservoir is one of the most important components of the total system because it determines what will flow into the bottom of the well and is the most complex component of those studied in a well system. Consequently, the reservoir must be accurately described by an appropriate model. Various reservoir models, commonly called IPR'S, have been described in the literature; most deal with steady-state radial flow. For oil wells, these include Vogel's equation Standing's modification of the Vogel equation, Fetkovich's equation, and the familiar radial form of Darcy's equation. For gas wells, the common IPR's are the backpressure equation and Darcy's radial-flow equation. These IPR's are adequate in most cases for determining pressure drops through the reservoir. For hydraulically fractured wells, however, especially long fractures and tight formations, the steady-state radial-flow IPR's are not adequate because of the unsteady-state nature of fractured-well flow. Several methods of dealing with stimulated wells have been suggested. One method involves a modification of the existing steady-state radial-flow IPR equation by changing the flow efficiency to represent the stimulated condition. This approach is limited in that flow efficiency, a steady-state concept, does not account for the unsteady-state response of fractured wells. A second method involves the use of published production-increase curves, such as those described by McGuire and Sikora and Soliman. SPEPE P. 608^

AB  - Abstract Two common challenges to sustain production in North Kuwait (NK) include (1) management of artificial lift equipment run life and (2) reduction of production decline through pressure maintenance by water injection. Standard electric submersible pump (ESP) management guidelines promote practices to protect ESP run life while sacrificing well production rates. However, using operating rates that are not always safe can permit optimum reservoir recovery. Better management of well production targets is required to maintain safe ESP operation ranges while pushing the limits to increase production. A methodology has been developed to continuously optimize the well production potential without surpassing its safe operating envelope, keeping pump intake pressure (PIP) above the bubble point, ensuring optimum delivery at the surface, and minimizing pump downtime. This workflow was developed to assist the engineers in expediting data analysis and interpretation. This paper describes the developed production optimization methodology, which enables short- and long-term production enhancement while honoring reservoir, ESP, and surface constraints. The process involves historical and real-time data collection and production test interpretation. From this analysis, the best estimations of short- and long-term well production potentials are identified, and the correspondent action plans are determined. The developed workflow and the result of such an iterative production optimization process are illustrated. To date, as a result of this effort, an average of 8% in production gains has been certified in a number of wells in Sabriyah, NK. Introduction Sabriyah field is produced predominantly with the assistance of ESPs equipped with downhole gauges (DHGs), providing both PIP and pump discharge pressure (PDP). The knowledge of surface and downhole parameters is routinely used for pump diagnostics and optimization. Perhaps one of the most recurrent questions coming from the management during the engineering and operations (E&O) companies' morning meeting was related to the maximum hydrocarbon volume that can be produced from a certain well, supposing no flow restriction and that it would be achievable at current production conditions. To provide a reliable answer, the ideal production potential (IPP) and the actual production potential (APP) of the interested well must be known. Usually, the reservoir engineer provides the IPP, while the petroleum engineer provides the APP. The second recurrent question is related to the required actions to be performed to make the APP equal or as close as possible to the IPP. Performing well production tests is one of the most common practices to determine APP, while IPP can be determined by the execution of transient pressure tests‚Äîbuildup or drawdown. The interpretation of transient pressure tests provides both IPP and APP. If APP is significantly lower than IPP, this means that a flow restriction exists at the sand-face and is usually expressed as skin factor or ?P skin. The removal of ?P skin requires the execution of matrix stimulation. The APP alone also can be determined through well production tests if downhole data are measured. The following paragraphs illustrate how the multirate production tests are used to determine APP and how short- and long-term well production capacity are determined while honoring reservoir and production system (ESP) constraints. Moreover, the process to generate a calibrated well model based on multirate production test results using one of the available workflows (Well Performance Evaluation) belonging to the Kuwait integrated digital field (KwIDF) workflows platform is also illustrated. The KwIDF workflows platform (Fig. 1) focuses on well surveillance and production operations for short- and long-term decisions using real-time data to help improve well performance and reduce well downtime (Al-Abbasi et al. 2013).

AB  - ABSTRACTThe corrosion problem is, of course, an old one. The petroleum industry has always been confronted with certain phases of this problem, and the corrosion of high-pressure distillate-well equipment is a comparatively new phase of an old problem. There are now operating approximately 100 distillate fields in this country; and, although a few of these fields are more than 10 years old, the majority have been brought in during the past 6 or 7 years. As far as the oil operator is concerned, distillate-well corrosion is. therefore, a development of the past few years. Sufficient concern regarding this problem had accumulated by late 1943 to cause the first organized attempt by the various interested parties to gain more general knowledge as to causes of this type of corrosion, and to develop means of prevention. Early in 1944 both the American Petroleum Institute (API) and Natural Gasoline Association of America (NGAA) organized high-pressure distillate-well corrosion committees for this purpose. The NGAA solicited contributions from various operating companies, and therewith initiated a research program for the purpose of investigating both the causes and means of prevention of this particular type of corrosion. In order to avoid duplication of effort, and in order to obtain the most satisfactory and complete results in the least amount of time, the API Special Subcommittee on Corrosion of High-Pressure Production Equipment, a similar committee organized by the National Association of Corrosion Engineers, the U. S. Bureau of Mines, and the research departments of many of the producing companies joined in active cooperation with the NGAA-sponsored research program. This cooperative undertaking has been in progress for approximately two years; and, although general knowledge of the subject throughout the petroleum industry because of this work has increased in many ways; and, although many of the research results obtained both from the laboratory and from the field have been very gratifying, the practical answers to the problem are far from being solved. Consequently, the research work must continue, and continue with accelerated effort. More emphasis should be placed on field experimental work so as to:, improve on the present means of well-head inspection for corrosive attack; , ascertain what material or materials, if any, are resistant to this particular type of corrosive action and can be used as practical substitutes for the presently used well materials; and,, determine an efficient and satisfactory chemical that can be used as a neutralizer or used as an inhibitor to the corrosive action, and an efficient and practical means of introducing such chemical into the bottom of the well.It is not the purpose of this paper to present the technical aspects of the corrosion problem, nor to go into detailed descriptions of the research work being conducted by the various organizations and the results obtained there from, but to give a general picture of the overall corrosion problem including the extent and characteristics of corrosion in the different distillate fields, the hazards and economic losses confronting the oil operator,

AB  - ABSTRACTDeep water subsea production technology is probably the most rapidly advancing area in the field of offshore engineering. The considerable efforts devoted to improve and optimise subsea equipment reliability and maintainability have culminated in the evolution of a new generation of modularised template and template component designs; these require new intervention tools and support vehicles and the market has been quick to respond with suitable system designs. The impact of this rapid development of subsea equipment and corresponding maintenance intervention equipment design upon topside requirements on floating production facilities has, by and large, remained unrecognised by vessel designers and builders; conventional offshore drilling vessel designs still predominate. Detailed assessment of anticipated subsea maintenance requirements and related facets of offshore operations has highlighted the significant economic benefits emanating from the provision on a floating production facility of at least a simple work string derrick, and preferably, full workover facilities. Integration studies must be undertaken in which subsea equipment design and topside maintenance support requirements are fully evaluated to achieve an optimised floating production facility. INTRODUCTIONIt is generally considered within the Oil Industry that the majority of large hydrocarbon discoveries, in currently accessible offshore locations, have been discovered and that significant emphasis must now be given to the development of effective means of producing marginally economic hydrocarbon deposits, and those located in deep water, hostile environmental locations. The application of floating production facilities in association with subsea completed wells to develop such discoveries is an area in which considerable attention is currently being focussed. The deployment of a floating production facility, especially in deep water, requires thorough evaluation on a total field development basis, embracing platform anchoring systems and motion characteristics, production and export riser systems through to the subsea completed wells. Installation and maintenance of subsea equipment, together with limited deck area and payload capacity, are factors which can have great influence upon the technical and economic feasibility of floating production facilities. Several studies have been conducted into the development of subsea multiwell template systems for operation in conjunction with both floating and fixed processing facilities. These have, by and large, concentrated upon the absolute need to integrate the design of subsea equipment and associated maintenance intervention vehicles and tools; the necessary degree of emphasis has not always been given to the optimisation of topside support facilities for subsea maintenance intervention tasks and the attendant space and payload constraints that such requirements can impose upon a floating production facility. When a dedicated field surface support facility is provided such factors need not be so extensively evaluated. However, in field developments for which dedicated facilities cannot be justified on economic or other grounds, the impact of subsea maintenance intervention requirements can have a dominant effect upon a floating production facility and, in the ultimate analysis, on field development economics generally.

AB  - This chapter describes the result of the detailed design stage of a development programme undertaken jointly by Vetco Gray, as a designer and manufacturer of subsea production systems, and Comex Houlder as designer and operator of remote intervention systems Supported by eight oil companies and the EEC, the project is proceeding and the designs presented here are currently being manufactured. A full testing programme is scheduled for July 1989. A unique feature of the programme and the design is that it is derived by a team incorporating the manufacturer and designer of subsea production systems (Vetco), the operator of the remote intervention system (Comex Houlder), and most important, the operators of the equipment who are charged with keeping the subsea equipment operating (1.e the oil companies) The initiative for the programme was taken by Comex Houlder and Vetco Gray and they have led the design. However, this has been subject to continuing input and audit by the oil companies, whose direct experience of actually operating and maintaining subsea systems has been fundamental to the success of the design. The technical description given in this chapter is a very brief overview of the developed system. Further information is available from the authors.THE ECONOMICS OF REMOTE INTERVENTIONMAINTENANCE IN DIVER WATER DEPTHSThe impetus for this development programme was not the need to produce in deep water. The justification of the programme was the reduction in field operating costs and reduction in lost production which it was believed could result from designing subsea production equipment on an integrated basis with maintenance systems to be used to intervene on it remotely The economics of remote intervention have been addressed elsewhere (Ref. 1). Depending on the type of subsea development involved, this analysis showed that the internal rate of return (IRR) for a field development could be measurably improved by replacing the diver with remote methods during the operational phase of field development.The designs produced in the current programme have shown that subsea production system can be designed to maximize remote intervention with only a marginal cost increase over equipment which will not allow remote intervention Feeding this result into the analysis undertaken in Ref. 1 shows that the use of remote intervention for the type of field development considered (Fig. 1) can improve the IRR by up to 3%The improvement derives from three factors: the capital savings resulting from not having to install a dive system on the floating production platform, the lower cost of ROV support vessels as opposed to diving vessels, and the reduced amount of lost production due to failure of tree-based equipment and length of time to mobilize and carry out an intervention. The effect of each of these is debatable, but whatever the amounts, the overall result is an improvement in the internal rate of return of approximately 3%.

AB  - ABSTRACT The Aquila project guidelines and actual results will be discussed in this paper. Drilling features (in particular the drilling information system and the drilling of the drain hole), the completion and the long production test using a tanker for storage will be discussed. The logistic and environmental problems associated with the mooring system, including the tanker, will also be covered. INTRODUCTION Deep water hydrocarbon reserves are considered one of the most promising frontiers for E&P activity in the near future. Technology, considered as a combination of innovator equipment and experience, will play a leading role in providing an economic and safe means of confronting the emerging deep water challenges. The southern Adriatic Sea is an area of high hydrocarbon potential in deep waters. This basin is located in water depth of 500-1000 m. The first investigation, dating back to the late Seventies gave encouraging results (fig. 1).However, the technology available at that time did not offer any acceptable technical and economical solutions in order to test the well on a viable way. With advances in deep water completion technology it has become possible to adequately manage environmental and safety constraints.The Aquila appraisal well was drilled in 820 m of water and an LPT was performed, using a last generation moored semisubmersible rig, assisted by a storage tanker. Facilities were designed to meet local regulations concerning environmental aspects and the sour gas content of the produced crude.The drilling activity was monitored in real time at the AGIP Ortona District and at the Company's headquarters in Milan through the in-house developed "Advanced information Drilling System" (ADIS). nother challenge was the development of a safe and reliable surface, storage and transport system in an area where weather conditions can become really severe.A project of such complexity required multidisciplinary tasks and the adoption of the most advanced technologies. Although technology concerning completion aspects can be considered as relatively new, it still requires careful evaluation for specific field application.Further studies on the implementation of subsea production equipment for water depths in excess of 800 m are in progress. SYSTEM DESCRIPTION AND GENERAL PREMISESA production test, consisting of continuous production from the Aquila drain hole, lasted 85 days.Testing equipment was installed on the same semisubmersible platform used for drilling.The produced and treated oil was conveyed from the semisubmersible through a flexible buoyant line to a storage tanker moored to the platform (fig. 2).CHARACTERISTICS OF THE SYSTEMDrilling rig. The FGL-1020 trendsetter R&B "Jack Bates" drilling rig was used. H was equipped with thrusters and a mooring system that allows safe mooring in water depth in excess of 1000 m, with 18 ¬æ"-15,000 psi multiplex BOP stack and a lower marine riser package (LMRP) quick reacting time (20 sec.).The platform was designed to work under particularly severe weather conditions and to allow "zero discharge".

AB  - Abstract Efficient oilfield asset management requires the effective use of real-time data, model updates, and optimization of control variables to produce the most favorable choices However, the orchestration of disciplines, workflow tools and available data represents critical issues in the oil industry. In many cases, the engineer may not focus on high-impact tasks nor generate added-value opportunities. Instead, the engineer's attention is diverted to collect, manipulate and create data charts. Data collection and validation, as well as model validation and updates, are repetitive tasks that may be automated under certain conditions to relieve engineers from low- value-added tasks. Real-time production optimization (RTPO) is one component of the Digital Oil Field (DOF) that aims to solve these issues. This paper focuses on the implementation of an RTPO system in the Okume Complex field in Offshore Equatorial Guinea. Two main challenges in this field include continuously allocating gaslift in frequently changing field conditions while minimizing production losses as well as understanding and maximizing the field production plateau. A commercial tool was used to demonstrate the value of RTPO. The implemented project supports the automation of standard workflows within the asset. The project proved several hypotheses concerning the streamlining of data capture, discipline interaction and model sustainability. Data availability and model readiness resulted as key factors from the fast and proficient implementation of the tool. The implementation of the project reduced the time requirement for test data gathering, validating, and model updating by more than 70%. The intelligent wells achieved continuous zonal allocation while minimizing the risks of crossflow. According to the results of this work, the asset is now able to adjust gaslift settings on a daily basis for optimizing production between 1.0% and 5.1% daily. This paper presents a summary of the benefits during pilot implementation, current project status, and the next steps. Introduction Operators face the challenge of maintaining and increasing mature asset production by optimizing their artificial lift systems and managing well operating constraints. Production optimization requires a deep understanding of well performance resulting from well test validation and updates, accurate well rate estimation and volume allocation. Frequently, current assets do not have a consistent way to maintain and update production models, and if it is done, it is rarely done using the same methodology by different users. Therefore, engineers may not have a consistent way to generate added-value opportunities from integrated production models (IPM's). There is a need for a tool or methodology to continuously provide optimization settings for the asset that allows the generation of added-value opportunities.

AB  - Once a horizontal well is hydraulically fractured, the next step is to clean up the well by flowing it back to remove water and loosen proppant from the wellbore. Most shale producers in North America have given little thought to this flowback stage and see it merely as a prelude to the cash-flow generating production stage. However, a few companies have come to realize it represents a valuable opportunity to learn more about their wells in a week or two than their competitors are learning after several months of production. Essentially, flowback data is a bridge between what happened during a completion and what will happen as hydrocarbons are produced. An important driver shared by all the interested producers is that for the most part, they are already required to record the flowback stage per US and Canadian regulations. ‚ÄúSo arguably, the cost of collecting this data is nil,‚Äù said James Crafton, president of consultancy firm Performance Sciences, who has been working with service companies and shale producers on different flowback issues for more than 15 years. Crafton and others involved in this area have long been trying to convince the shale business that how a well is flowed back is often as important as the completion itself and that by ignoring this maxim, they are leaving money on the table. ‚ÄúIt is that simple,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúThe frustration for me is that the data is there. We have the data, but nobody has the time or perceives the value to interpret the data.‚Äù But there are a few outliers crunching the numbers. Companies including Devon Energy are using the early production and flowing pressure data of flowback fluids to establish their production benchmarks. Nexen Energy is among those also using flowback data to quickly screen the effective size of fracture designs, determine key reservoir properties, and to predict long-term production. Ongoing flowback research is looking at the chemical makeup of flowback fluids to see what else can be learned about shale reservoir behavior.

AB  - Abstract The paper presents the flow assurance challenges and the mitigation steps taken in the deep, high pressure & high temperature North Kuwait Jurassic (NKJ) Fields. Flow assurance is extremely diverse subject linked to different engineering disciplines. Understanding the reservoir fluid behavior, rock minerals, completion & pipeline metallurgy and operating envelope is critical to understand and overcome the flow assurance challenges. Pipeline Hydrate Formation is the biggest operational challenge, which frequently disrupts the production of some of the high producing gas wells during the winter months. Different chemicals and combinations of such have been attempted to mitigate the hydrate problem, still optimization of the chemical injection process is ongoing. Other problems of solid, scale or salt blockage in the tubing, surface chokes and pipelines have occurred and steps were taken to clear the obstructions. The NKJ fluids are highly corrosive and a corrosion inhibitor is injected at the wellhead to protect the surface pipelines. Addressing all these challenges require thorough knowledge of the specialized subjects and advance modeling to improve the field operational philosophy. In the NKJ fields, the pipeline connecting the well to the processing facility (5 ‚Äì 30 Km long) are neither buried nor insulated. During the winter months (during night & early morning), the well fluid cools down below the hydrate formation temperature in the flowline causing hydrate crystallization and even plugging of the pipeline. Out of the 30 producing wells in the NKJ fields, half of the wells produce water and have hydrate tendency. The produced water salinity varies from well to well and range from fresh water to highly saline water with salinity as high as 330 kppm. This makes the system highly complex and manifest need for a robust solution. The paper walks through the traditional methods of hydrate mitigation done in the NKJ fields and the way in which transient model was initially built and continuously improved with more data. Currently methanol is used as the hydrate inhibitor and an anti-agglomerate (AA) is under trial. The methanol concentration is governed mostly by experience and on a reactive mode. An offline transient model advisor was built to understand the hydrate mechanism and optimize the methanol injection The advisor is still under trial, once simulation matches with the field conditions, then it will be online and linked to the existing KwIDF (Kuwait Integrated Digital Fields) technology program. Under KwIDF, Chemical Management workflow will be designed to optimize methanol injection to minimize the well downtime and reduce the OPEX cost. The transient advisor also can predict the surge at the facility inlet which can assist in balancing the production in and out of the facility.

AB  - Abstract This paper presents a simple method to predict the over-all production performance of oil and gas systems. Conventional methods usually require time consuming graphical approaches. The proposed method is based on a simple mathematical algorithm that provides fast and accurate means to estimate the over-all performance of a production system. In addition, the proposed method has been designed EO search for unstable production conditions that might exist i11 the system.The method has been used to develop a computer model representing a system consisting of several production components, The production components considered in the computer model are: reservoir, perforations, gravel pack, tubing, subsurface safety valve, wellhead choke, surface pipeline and separator. In addition, a gas lift system is also included.Practical applications of the model are presented, and these include sensitivity analysis of the performance of an oil production system and evaluation of unstable conditions in a gas condensate system. Results from this model are compared and agree closely with several cases presented in the literature.IntroductionOver-all production performance is the flow rate that a system is able to sustain under the restrictions imposed by the production components. Physical restrictions of production systems can be divided into several components such that the pressure losses across each component are evaluated independently. Correct determination of the performance of a production system depends ultimately on the accuracy of the pressure loss predictions across each component of the system. Research efforts in the last few years have resulted in several methods and correlations capable of accurately predicting pressure losses across different production components for a wide range of operating conditions. These include, correlations to estimate pressure losses in pipelines, vertical tubings, and other restrictions (chokes, safety valves) for multiphase flow conditions. Also, methods and correlations are available to estimate reservoir deliverability from stabilized well test data with good accuracy. On the other hand, additional investigation is required to improve methods for the prediction of pressure losses across well completions (gravel pack and perforations). Several of these methods and correlations used in this work are discussed in a later section.Calculation of over-all production performance of a system in-volves a simple principle. This consists of dividing the production system into two parts at a fixed point (node), and for a given flow rate, starting for one pan at the reservoir and for the other pan at the separator, evaluating the required pressure at that point for each part by including the pressure drop across each component(1,2,3). The production performance is determined by the flow rate which provides the same pressure for each side of node al the selected node. It can be shown that production performance determined in this way is independent of the node used La divide the system(l).Nodal Analysis(l) (trade mark of Flopetrol-Johnstone-Schlumberger) is a technique which provides guidelines to select the most convenient node to analyze a production system.

AB  - ABSTRACT: As horizontal wells become increasingly common, the need to make measurements to optimise well health and manage the reservoir also increases. Production logging in horizontal wells with multiphase flow present data acquisition challenges in the form of both conveyance method and sensor selection. In this paper we present an approach to logging a horizontal well using new generation array sensors. The well was cased and perforated with high water cut and sand production. Logging while tractoring a combination of conventional (centralised) and array sensors provided a good quality data set that enabled successful identification and shut off of sand and water. The use of a new impeller design in a minispinner array helped overcome the challenges sand production posed in the well. Smaller minispinner thresholds improved the velocity profile allowing us to identify water recirculation at very low rates. An array resistance measurement provided an estimate of water holdup. Tool rotation proved a tremendous benefit for array sensors run in this harsh environment. Tool rotation helped keep the sensors free from debris while the traditional centralised spinner show an increased tendency for jamming when intersecting sand dunes or restrictions along the well trajectory. In addition, the rotating array sensors provide better circumferential coverage in the well. A sand detection instrument was used in combination with the production logging string. The instrument is fully combinable with the production logging string and simultaneous data acquisition makes it easy to integrate all sensors allowing a robust interpretation of sand influx and water salinity. INTRODUCTION¬†The candidate well is located on Mungo Field (Central North Sea, Zett et al 2008) and was completed as a gaslift producer in September 2009. At the time of logging (August 2010), the well was tested with 671bopd, 1173bwpd and 0.27mmscf/d produced gas.

AB  - AbstractOf the various mechanisms that currently enable intelligent well systems, open/close remote-controlled sleeves and strain gauges are mature and less expensive than chokes and quartz gauges, yet they have many interesting applications when used in combination with Electric Submersible Pumps (ESPs). Though limited in functionality, they enable applications such as selective isolation of zones, as in the case of anticipated water breakthrough; fluid loss prevention when the ESP is turned off; or tandem ESP configurations for pump boost or redundancy. The lower costs of these tools make them economically attractive in many artificially lifted wells.IntroductionThe intelligent completions business arose in response to very real needs by operators for means to control wells that touched multiple intervals in the reservoir. At the time they were conceived, it was assumed that intelligent completions would be mostly used in high end wells such as subsea installations, where the high cost of intervention made conventional completions uneconomical. Field experience over the last 5 years confirms that intelligent completions have much wider applicability. Among the fastest-growing user markets for the technology are wells that are artificially lifted, particularly with ESPs.Artificial lift is typically used in mature fields, which often are cost-sensitive. Intelligent completions with remote-controlled open/close devices are mature and reliable. They provide a cost-effective method of monitoring relevant formation parameters and controlling production when used in combination with artificial lift systems.ESP wells are often prolific producers in high water cut or mature fields. A user of ESPs has already committed to running electric lines and protectors along the completion. Adding a few more lines to accommodate intelligent completions requires a small incremental cost but can add significant potential for value creation. There are several template application patterns that support using intelligent completions under ESPs. This paper explores various applications for simple open/close (on/off) flow control valves. Other papers that cover related topics such as different application patterns and specific case studies of synergies between ESP and intelligent well technology are referenced at the end of this paper.BackgroundFor the purposes of this paper, we define an intelligent completion as one that includes the ability to monitor relevant formation parameters and remotely control production. There are two main remote-control mechanisms in use today. The simplest is the open/close or on/off remotely controlled valve. These devices enable or prevent flow from annulus to tubing or from one segment of tubing to another. A more functional version of these devices is the remotely controlled choke, which allows for intermediate levels of flow in addition to open and close. Chokes can be infinitely variable or discrete in that the user must select a predetermined number of choking levels. Remote actuation of chokes or on/off valves can be achieved by hydraulic control, electric control or electro-hydraulic mechanisms.The most conventional monitoring mechanisms are downhole pressure/temperature gauges. These include high-precision quartz gauges and lower-cost but less accurate strain gauges. Flow and density can be derived from pressure and temperature. Flow can be measured by monitoring the pressure differential across a flow restriction. Density can be monitored by measuring the pressure difference due to changes in hydrostatic pressure at different depths in a well. Other technologies such as fiber optics add to the monitoring capabilities at hand.

AB  - AbstractFalling wellhead pressures drastically reduce the productivity and economics of a well. If there is a supply nearby of high pressure gas, the well productivity can be increased by using the high pressure energy in an ejector. An extensive programme of laboratory tests and offshore trials has been carried out to ove and optimise ejector design for onsrhore application. This has included the use of "flexible" multiple nozzles to allow continued effective operation as well pressures reduce. Existing design methods have been significantly improved and embedded into user-friendly software, which has been validated against the results. Ejectors were installed on two platforms in the Phillips operated Hewett Gas Field in the Southern sector of North Sea. Trials have proven very successful, with increases in gas production ranging from 15 to 25 MMSCF/D. In both cases a payback on investment of only a few weeks was achieved. Further opportunities for ejector installation are now being actively sought. Investigations for the use of ejectors for multiphase boosting are continuing. IntroductionIn 1987, Phillips Petroleum faced a potential shortfall in gas production from the Hewett field. In consultation with CALtec (the Oil and Gas operation of BHR Group), an ejector was identified as a viable solution, whereby the energy from a high pressure group of wells could be used to boost production of depleted wells. As a result, a joint programme of work between CALtec and Phillips Petroleum to improve design and operating knowledge of ejectors for offshore gas pressure boosting was carried out. This involved a combination of laboratory tests, offshore trials and the development of design software. The results of this joint programme, and the benefits achieved from it, are described in this paper. 2. OBJECTIVES 2.1 To prove the feasibility of using ejectors for gas boosting, and hence increasing production levels. 2.2 To develop and calibrate thearetical models for compressible flow ejector performance. 2.3 To compare offshore performance against theoretical model results. 2.4 To identify methods of improving ejector performance and flexibility. 2.5 To develop ejector design software.

Abstract A systematic approach is presented for generating transient inflow performance relationship curves for finite conductivity vertically performance relationship curves for finite conductivity vertically fractured wells. A semi-analytical model was developed to simulate dimensionless wellbore pressure drop and dimensionless pressure loss through the fracture vs. dimensionless time at constant-rate of production for wells intercepted by a finite-conductivity vertical fracture. Flowing bottom hole pressure can be predicted at any time period using these dimensionless variables. System average pressure at any stage of production can be obtained through material balance calculations. production can be obtained through material balance calculations. A straight line reference curve was observed at all times provided that the real gas pseudo-pressure function is used to plot m (p wf(t))/m(pR (t)) vs. qg (t)/ q gmax (t). The advantage of normalizing the dimensionless variable in terms of pseudo-pressure function is that only one straight line relationship is obtained throughout the entire production life of the reservoir. This provides a more simple means for performance prediction purposes. prediction purposes. The major contribution of this paper is the provision of a valuable tool to study the sensitivity of fracture design parameters on ultimate well performance. The economic benefits of this approach can be substantial. Introduction Hydraulic fracturing has been recognized to be an effective means for improving well productivity from low permeability reservoirs. During the past decade, a large amount of energy and effort has been given to the past decade, a large amount of energy and effort has been given to the determination of transient pressure behavior of the well intercepted by a vertical fracture. As a result, three basic solutions along with analysis method have been presented. They are uniform-flux, infinite-conductivity and finite-conductivity solution for vertical fractures. Type-curve matching has been proposed as an interpretation technique to determine reservoir properties and fracture characteristics from pressure transient test data. The contributions of these works have provided the practicing engineer with a better understanding of the fractured reservoir performance. performance. In 1968, Vogel presented a correlation to generate inflow performance relationships (IPR) curves for solution-gas drive wells based on the assumption of steady-state Darcy's law. The application of IPR curves in the analysis of total production systems are well recognized. Recently exploitation of low-permeability or tight gas reservoirs has required more advanced well stimulation techniques, such as massive hydraulic fracturing (MHF). Unfortunately, the transient IPR curves for wells intercepted by a finite-conductivity vertical fracture has not been investigated until now. It should be realized that pseudo-steady state pressure behavior for a tight gas reservoir is rarely seen in the early production life of the wells. Therefore, a systematic approach for generating transient IPR curves is one important objective of this work. Several questions have been asked quite often among production engineers. How can a frac job be designed for tight gas wells? what is the optimal fracture half length? What are the tubing and surface facility constraints? Can production rate vs. fracture half length be predicted before the fracturing operations? To answer the above questions, we should look at the total system performance, i.e.; both reservoir and tubing capacity performance. The model developed in this work will allow production engineers to make a judgement using production rate vs. fracture production engineers to make a judgement using production rate vs. fracture half length relationship as a criterion in designing a fracture job. The objectives of this work include: (1) The utilization of type curves to predict transient reservoir performance (IPR curves) under different fracture characteristics. (2) The sensitivity of tubing capacity performance under different conditions. (3) Combining tubing capacity performance with reservoir performance to predict production rate vs. fracture half length relationships. p. 491

AB  - Abstract The GC-01 KwIDF system has been deployed in the East Kuwait area of Burgan oil field and includes real time production surveillance instrumentation for wells and production facility. The raw data from the wells and facility is integrated with well and network models in an automated workflow process for surveillance and analysis of the GC-01 production. The Burgan oil field integrated digital field (KwIDF) automation system utilizes wellhead pressure and water-cut measurements for automated calibration of well and surface network models. The KwIDF system workflow utilizes calibrated well models and real time data to identify changes in GC-01 daily production and reconciles it with the contributing wells. The workflow identifies wells with production changes and associates them with key well and facility parameters for instant diagnosis and analysis of daily production issues. This paper describes the application of real time data and integrated models in an automated workflow for quick identification and analysis of daily field production. Examples describe how the workflow has been used in quick analysis and decision making to optimize daily production and achieve sustainable targets in one of the production facilities of the Greater Burgan Field in Kuwait.

However, the uncertainty associated with production forecasts and non-uniqueness related with well/reservoir parameter estimation, are the main issues in future development of these reservoirs. In addition, recent operational methods such as restricting rates by decreasing the choke size add up to the uncertainty in production forecasts. This work attempts to investigate the effect of production practices on ultimate recovery. It is observed that wells producing in the Haynesville shale gas play exhibit severe productivity loss throughout their producing life. Production practices such as controlling the drawdown or restricting rates by decreasing the choke size are employed by several operators to deal with the severe productivity loss. In this work our main objective is to investigate the issues (such as stress dependent permeability, proppant embedment, operational problems, etc.) contributing to decreasing well productivity over time. In particular, from modeling standpoint, we focus on stress-dependent permeability as a mechanism, which affects well performance over time. Using a horizontal well with multiple fractures numerical simulation model coupled with geomechanics, we generate synthetic simulation cases including several drawdown scenarios. It is shown that high drawdown cases result in higher effective stress fields around the well and fracture system. We therefore infer that higher effective stress fields result in lower well productivity over time. Based on this hypothesis and diagnostics of field data, we model two different scenarios (i.e., high drawdown and low drawdown cases) for a horizontal well with multiple fractures using two different permeability decay functions and same well/formation model parameters. Our modelling results indicate that low drawdown case yields higher recovery suggesting that rate restriction could be a mitigating factor in decreasing well productivity over time. Introduction Hydrocarbon production from unconventional reservoir systems (e.g., tight gas sands, shale gas, tight/shale oil, etc.) has become significant in recent years due to recent advances in the technology allowing to drill and complete wells in these complex reservoir systems at lower costs. The developments in the technology to develop and produce complex unconventional reservoir systems such as shale gas reservoirs bring the difficulties and uncertainty associated with well performance. The uncertainty is mainly due to the lack of our complete understanding of the production mechanisms and behavior of these reservoir systems. And the difficulty is therefore associated with establishing the long term production decline in these reservoirs. In simple terms this study focuses on the factors affecting well performance and productivity in the Haynesville shale. Significant amount of natural gas has been produced from the Haynesville shale since 2008 and the Haynesville shale is considered as one of the largest natural gas fields in the United States. The Haynesville shale is a black, organic rich shale of Upper Jurassic age located in east Texas and northwest Louisiana, which is deposited with mainly heavier clay minerals, silica, and calcite. The depth of the Haynesville shale ranges from approximately 10,000 ft in the northwest part to 14,000 ft in the southeast (Buller et al. 2010). It is overpressured with pressure gradients higher than 0.9 psi/ft. Due to high reservoir pressure of the Haynesville shale, production practices has been shifted to control drawdown or to restrict the rates by the operators to avoid any damage occuring in the well/reservoir during production.

AB  - Abstract Usari field is known for its sand production history. The first sand production incident occurred in 2001 when a choke had a pin-hole leak resulting from sand production/erosional effect. Since then, produced sand and residual sand in sub-sea pipelines have caused recurrent failures of surface rotating equipment (pumps), frequent de-sanding of vessels and topsides and volumetric downtime (deferred production) associated with total platform shutdown or restricted production. In the past, sand management and surveillance activities included conducting bucket and screen (B&S) sand checks or sampling on all flowing wells as part of monthly routine well test; utilizing a hydro-cyclone sand trap to conduct comprehensive sand checks on identified sand producing wells and establishing sand free production rates; monitoring wells to ensure they are flowing at established sand free rates; and carrying out periodic de-sanding of surface vessels and topsides. A step change in the approach to sand management and surveillance in Usari field was implemented in 2009, when a multi-functional team was chartered to develop procedures for Usari startup and post-startup operating philosophy. In addition to existing sand management practices, the team implemented bucket & screen (B&S) sand checks at strategic topsides locations (upstream of the separator and at the main online pumps (MOLP) suction). The team also developed a spreadsheet to calculate sand production rates and established benchmarks for acceptable sand production rates through the MOLPs. The team provided on-site supervision of startup activities and monitored sand surveillance activities through the Asset Level Team (ALT). Usari field was successfully restored to full production and currently produces at over 120% of post-startup average production. Wells were produced at maximum sand-free rates and disruption to continuous production due to sand-related platform shutdowns were minimized, thereby maximizing value in a sand- prone asset. Post startup, the team continues to provide guidance to field operations, and sand surveillance results are reviewed during ALT meetings.

AB  - Calvin Kessler*+ and Gary Frisch*+AbstractA new-generation, production logging toolstring is being introduced with a sensor that can measure fullbore gas holdup. Unlike previous center-sampling holdup sensors (whether radioactive fluid-density or capacitance holdup), this new sensor responds to the entire cross-sectional area of the production tubulars (casing, tubing, or slotted liner) occupied by gas and liquid. From this response, the holdup fractions for liquid and gas (Yl and Yg) can be determined.The fullbore measurement eliminates previous uncertainties in holdup fractions that can occur when flowing conditions are nonuniform or when water cut is high. This new capability is shown by flow loop comparisons between measurements taken with the fullbore gas-holdup tool and those taken with previous center-sampling holdup sensors in horizontal stratified flowing conditions.The new production logging toolstring includes a high-speed, bidirectional, monocable digital telemetry system. This system permits simultaneous logging with additional tools such as pulsed neutron tools, oxygen-activation water-flow tools, or other radioactive fluid-velocity tools. The combination of production logging sensors with oxygen activation measurements are important for the evaluation in complex well completions where there are flow paths both inside and outside of the production tubulars, such as with slotted liners.An interactive wellsite production logging analysis package has been developed to utilize the improved data. Both flow-loop-based and conventional slip- velocity interpretation methods are available for determining the flow rates of the individual phases. A new method for determining the downhole flow regime is presented which utilizes both the center- sample holdup and the fullbore holdup measurements.IntroductionProduction logging (PL) data are used to determine the rate and type of fluid entering or leaving the completion string. The production logging data can be classified according to the type of measurement used to obtain the data: fluid velocity, holdup, pressure, temperature, and auxiliary measurements, such as noise.P. 431

AB  - Abstract The asset optimization system deployed in Kuwait's Greater Burgan oil field involved development of an integrated model of the processing facility, flowlines and wells. The objective of the integrated asset model is to achieve production optimization from the network considering well performance and restrictions combined with the limitation imposed by the surface piping network and the processing facilities. The Burgan oil field's integrated digital field (KwIDF) automation system monitors well and plant instruments in real time from SCADA and DCS systems. It uses real time wellhead pressure and water water-cut measurements for virtual metering and calibration of the well and network models. To maintain the facility production target, various built-in production optimization scenarios are run daily and the results are visualized through smart dashboards in the state-of-the-art collaboration center. The results are shown as new optimized set points for choke or header changesto achieve facility production targets. The new set points can be automatically passed on to the SCADA system for implementation after quick validation by the stakeholders. The paper provides new insights on the challenges of effectively running an integrated well and network model in an automated workflow through full loop, from measurement to implementing recommendations at wells and the production facility. Examples are presented on how the workflow has been used in quick analysis and decision making to optimize daily production and achieve sustainable targets in one of the production facilities at Greater Burgan field in Kuwait.

AB  - Abstract The use of Inflow Control Device (ICD) in long horizontal wells drilled in naturally fractured carbonate reservoirs (NFR) has helped alleviate premature water breakthrough and control high water production. The main factors associated to premature water breakthrough and high water cut in NFR wells are the uncertainty in fracture conductivities and location of fracture corridors crossing or nearby to the horizontal wellbore. In this paper, an assessment is provided of the production performance review conducted over a limited NFR area developed with some horizontal wells equipped with ICD completions versus other horizontal barefoot open-hole completions. Efforts have been made to compare the horizontal wells in same reservoir areas and layers of comparable reservoir quality and all wells used in this study had complete fluid losses during drilling. Data used in the evaluation included production and pressure data, image and caliper log, production log profile, fracture maps, open hole log and ICD completion design. Six horizontal wells equipped with ICDs are currently producing within expected oil production rates at low water cut. Two of these six wells with ICD's are observed to have water breakthrough delay of up to 18 months compared with offset barefoot open hole horizontal wells. These ICD wells have been on production for more than three years. On the other hand, three horizontal open-hole wells of similar characteristics are either dead or producing at a high water cut. This paper will shed light on lessons learned including in three horizontal wells equipped with ICDs that are experiencing high water cut. After reviewing all available well/reservoir/production data for the studied horizontal wells, some improvements have been recommended for both the ICD design approach and how wells equipped with ICD in NFR should be produced.?

AB  - Abstract The control of water production has always been one of the most critical challenges in Middle East oil fields. Good evaluation of water production mechanism results in a proper control on water, since there is a different job design for different mechanism. In general, water coning and/or multilayer channeling is the most production problem mechanisms in Middle East oil fields. The purpose of this work is to apply water control diagnostic plots technique to identify excessive water production mechanism. This method was applied for wells in Middle East sandstone oil reservoirs using actual production history data to generate log-log plots of WOR (water oil ratio) and dWOR/dt (simple time derivative of water oil ratio) vs. time. The plots were found to be effective in differentiating whether the well is experiencing water coning (negative slope) or multilayer channeling (positive slope for the time derivative of water oil ratio curve). The diagnostic plots applied in this study provide a handy method for quick evaluation of excessive water production mechanisms in order to select wells candidates for water control treatment. Introduction Premature water production is often a result of water coning and/or multilayer channeling; water coning is a phenomena result near a producing well which raises oil water contact only around the well. Water flows from the free water level in a vertical direction, since the production from a well would create pressure sink that tend to elevate the water-oil contact. Breakthrough of the coned water occurs at the lowest part of the well's completion interval, where production water cut increases rapidly and oil recovery becomes low. Water coning behavior can be explained as follows; 1) when a well produces oil at high rate, a large difference of flow potential is created around the well. 2) If bottom water exists and rock is sufficiently permeable in vertical direction, the water table below the well completion starts moving upwards. 3) Unless the production rate is reduced, the water table continues to rise and form a cone shape in oil/water boundary. 4) At least, the water will breakthrough to the well. It results in increasing production water cut rapidly. On the other hand, multilayer channeling, it is known as high water conductivity channels where water under runs the oil using the horizontal permeability. In both cases oil productivity is reduced, lifting cost with water disposal rises and recovery efficiency reduced.

AB  - AbstractProppant flowback following fracture stimulation treatments continues to be a major concern in many wells around the world. The current trend towards more tip screen out (TSO) and reverse screenout designs has increased the need for better control of proppant flowback under increasingly severe drag force conditions.Recent studies in the Codell formation have indicated a correlation between load water and polymer recovery on fracture cleanup and subsequent gas production. This paper describes a subsequent twenty-five well study of the specific effects of combining forced closure/reverse gravel packs along with varying flowback rates and choke schedules on load water recovery and normalized gas and condensate production. One of the key issues addressed is the use of aggressive flowback schedules while maintaining proppant flowback control.Introduction - Codell DescriptionThe Codell is a tight shaly sandstone that produces varying amount of gas and condensate in the D-J Basin of northeastern Colorado (Fig. 1). It is a retrograde condensate reservoir producing below the bubble point. Water production in the subject area is very small, usually 0 to 2 bpd. Formation characteristics are listed in Table 1. Some parts of the field are highly naturally fractured which can cause early screenouts of fracture treatments, but these natural fractures can also aid in production. Directly above the Codell is the Ft. Hayes member of the Niobrara formation, which is a clean limestone. The Ft. Hayes is also very brittle and could be naturally fractured in certain geographic areas. As most of the screenouts have been localized in specific geographic areas, it is believed that the fracture can grow up into the Ft. Hayes resulting in excessive fluid loss and causing an early screenout. A good indication of natural fractures is when a Density-Neutron log shows gas in the Ft. Hayes. Unfortunately very few of these logs have been performed.Field Study - Fracture DesignDue to the low permeability, the Codell must be fracture stimulated to be productive. Height growth while fracturing the Codell is believed to be predominately downward approximately 300 feet into the nonproductive Carlisle shale. Diversion techniques have been used on many of the wells to try to control the downward growth of the fracture. Fracture treatment designs have ranged from 175,000 to 250,000 total lb. of proppant added, with ramp schedules ranging from 2 ppa to 10 ppa, with an average concentration of 3.4 ppa.Several papers have been written about optimizing the fracture design in the Codell formation. A statistical study performed by Donovan indicated that proppant volume did not significantly affect the three year cumulative BOE, but that the net pay was the most important factor. Parker et. al. determined that inadequate fracture length and conductivity were the main problems to unsuccessful treatments.P. 525

AB  - Abstract Several classical wellhead production correlations have been developed and widely used all over the world for naturally flowing wells. For artificially flowing wells, many important well and fluid parameters are ignored in these correlations. This results in erroneous results and inaccurate predictions when these correlations are applied. These current correlations are mainly function of tubing head pressure, bean size (which has almost no effect for artificially flowing wells), and gas-liquid ratio only. The man objective of this study is to ovecome the limitations of these correlations for artificially flowing wells by development a new correlation capable to predict accurately the wellhead flow production. The new correlation was developed using a set of 1,750 data points from 352 producing wells in Egypt. The newly-developed correlation includes several parameters of tubing size, wellhead and bottom-hole temperatures, producing gas-oil ratio, pay zone depth, and water cut. A sensitivity analysis using the newly-developed correlation about the influences of involved well and reservoir parameters, is carried out. The results indicated that the newly-developed correlation is capable to predict the wellhead production rate accurately. Noteworthy, the variation of producing depth, tubing size and wellhead temperature has real impact on production rate while variation in bottom-hole temperature, water-cut and gas-oil ratio has relatively smaller effect on well production rate. The enhanced prediction of production rate using the new correlation is attributed to its consideration to many other parameters, which were ignored before in Gilbert and other's correlations; such as tubing size, wellhead temperatures, and pay zone depth. 1. Introduction and Literature Review The separator and multiphase meters have been considered and used to determine the oil well production. This has been considered as the most accurate method for calculating the oil and gas flow rates. However, these current methods are rather expensive and time consuming to be achieved. Therefore, it is usually desired to have quick and accurate evaluation of well performance considering wellhead parameters, especially pressure and temperature. Good utilization of pressure and temperatures parameters of producing wells reveals excellent and reliable information about well behavior and can help to make required remedial action(s) in required suitable time. For naturally flowing wells, bean performance correlation is the most widely used to monitor well performance. Most current correlations (Gilbert, 1954; Ros, 1960; Ashong, 1961; Asford, 1973; Secen, 1976; Abdul-Majeed, 1986) for two-phase flow across chocks are valid only for critical flow across the choke. The literature presented good correlations for single phase flow of either liquid or gas. However, reliable correlations for two-phase are limited and for multiphase are rare and scarce. This is especially true for flow in the sub-sonic flow region (i.e., flow velocities smaller than that of sound. The majority of current correlations for multiphase flow are valid only for critical flow condition. The most popular correlation was developed by Gilbert (1954) but it is valid for critical flow occurring when the upstream pressure of the choke is at least 70 % higher than the downstream pressure or when the ratio of down stream pressure to upstream pressure is equal to 0.588. In general, the literature (Abdul-Majeed, 1986; Al-Attar and Abdul-Majeed, 1988) reveals that keeping the ratio of downstream pressure to upstream pressure in the range from 0.50 to 0.60 secures the critical flow condition of the choke.

AB  - When during primary oil production the thermodynamic conditions within the well tubing lie inside the asphaltene deposition envelope (ADE) of the produced fluid, the flocculated asphaltene particles could start depositing on the tubing wall at a certain rate. The above causes a restriction in the tubing ID which results in loss of production. Higher choke settings are required to maintain the same production level until the choke is fully open and the production losses cannot be compensated by opening the choke further. Eventually, the well may ‚Ä≥bridge‚Ä≥ and stop flowing completely or continue flowing at an extremely small flow rate in a rather ‚Ä≥burping‚Ä≥ way where the flow starts and stops at different time intervals on its own volition. Understanding when and how to intervene not only diminishes the risk of unsuccessful or, even worst, detrimental operations but also may increase the well‚Äôs productivity throughout its life. This paper presents a methodology of first determining the ADE in the lab, along with the asphaltene particle size distribution as a function of pressure and temperature. Moreover, asphaltene deposition rates for the tubing conditions can be measured using high pressure and temperature coaxial cylinder technology. Utilizing this technique allows to quantify the amount of flocculated asphaltenes that will deposit under the expected conditions. From that data, it is illustrated how a well-equipped simulator can be, initially, tuned to predict the phase behavior measured in the lab along with the deposition rates. Finally, the simulator can then run the production scenarios available into the future, predicting the impact of asphaltene deposition in the tubing and the resulting loss of production and quantify the asphaltene deposit. It is apparent that this information can prove invaluable in the design of the well completion and flowline along with the facilities and help further refine the understanding of the expected production problems. This methodology is especially important in offshore satellite tieback wells expected to undergo asphaltene deposition.

AB  - Abstract Ever since its discovery in 1977, the Loma La Lata field, located in the Neuqu√©n basin, has been considered one of the most important gas fields in South America. During the last decade, the progressive reduction in the reservoir pressure has led to successive changes in the field's operation conditions: from high to medium pressure, and, most recently, to low pressure. As the reservoir pressure depletes, the subsequent reductions in the gas velocities bring about changes in the flow regimes and the increasing liquid flow rates. These liquids produced at the wellbore and/or generated by vapor condensation through the production string, contribute to increase the pressure drop along the tubing as well as the flowing bottomhole pressure, and will eventually reduce or prevent production. In most cases, not only does liquid loading arise as a consequence of these changes in operation conditions, but also other production problems such as mineral scales and organic deposits, and the difficulty to implement corrosion prevention conventional batch treatment programs aimed at extending the life of the production strings. In addition to the above, the increasing hydrocarbon demand, Argentina's energy policy and economical restrictions are also matter of relevance when it comes to implementing conventional solutions that imply several shutdown hours per treated well. The aforementioned problems have encouraged the operating and services companies to search for technological alternatives providing not only technical solutions but also economical benefits. After one year since a novel capillary string system that allows for the injection of chemical products, and/or the deployment of special devices such as memory gauges, at the desired depth was introduced in the country, the results obtained in several tests show a very promising future. This paper summarizes the first-year results achieved using the capillary string technology as a tool for production enhancement and optimization in the Loma La Lata field. Introduction With 196 major wells and an average daily production of 25 million standard cubic meters (883 million standard cubic feet), Loma La Lata, is the largest producing gas field in South America. This field, located in the Neuqu√©n Basin, Neuqu√©n Province of Argentina, was discovered by the formerly state-owned oil company YPF in 1977 and is currently operated by private Repsol-YPF under a concession that will last until 2027. The area covered by the main gas fields in the Neuqu√©n basin includes 4,481.47 Km¬≤ that are operated and 2,922.20 Km¬≤ non-operated. Within this area, the Loma La Lata, Sierra Barrosa, Aguada Pichana and Aguada San Roque fields supply about 31% of the Argentinean market total gas demand. Additionally, these fields provide for approximately 23% of the Argentinean natural gas exports, 59% of the industrial delivery and 62% of the distributing companies gas supply. At the beginning of their exploitation, the wells in the Loma La Lata field produced at a high pressure oscillating between 90 and 100 kilograms per square centimeter. Given the fact that trunk gas transportation pipelines operate at a pressure of 70 Kg/cm2 (6.86 x 106 Pa), it was imperative then to reduce its pressure before the gas was injected into these pipelines. As time went by, the reservoir pressure started to gradually decline as a natural consequence of its exploitation. At present, approximately 60% of the total gas flow rate is produced at medium pressure - between 40 and 70 Kg/cm2 (between 3.92 and 6.86 x 106 Pa) - and the remaining 40% at low pressure - between 15 and 40 Kg/cm2 (between 1.47 and 3.92 x 106 Pa) -. The estimations indicate that by 2007 the whole field will by producing at low pressure. As the power demand is increasing, the operating company has, on the one hand, started to invest in compressors in several plants in order to inject the gas into the pipelines at the specified pressure, and, on the other hand, to investigate possible methods to resort to when the pressure becomes lower than 15 Kg/cm2 (1.47 x 106 Pa). The first stage of a major gas compression project began about 6 years ago. During the last 4 years a second stage has been initiated, and the third phase will by finished by 2007. By then, Repsol-YPF will have installed 67 compressors in the field, including new and reformed ones.

AB  - The offshore platforms, located at great distances from the coast, pose many challenges to maintain and increase reliability of critical equipment, in order to decrease operational and maintenance costs. The difference between planned and non-planned shutdowns can be roughly millions of dollars for one platform. These facts justify the need for an enhanced monitoring system for critical equipment of offshore platforms, contributing to reduce risks, loss of production, and to raise equipment availability. One way to deal with this problem is to have remote monitoring centers which follow performance indicators of the various critical platforms' equipment (heat exchangers, pumps, compressors, etc.), with the main goal of identifying deviations, before they evolve to more serious faults. This center should have a well trained staff, good process to foster multidisciplinary collaboration with other specialized teams to diagnose and define required actions, and, last but not least, good tools to monitor the process variables. This paper will describe a set of tools for monitoring equipment performance, such as heat exchangers, pumps, and compressors. These tools try to identify the quality of equipment's sensors, to assess the performance of PID controllers associated with this equipment, and many other performance indicators as, for example, deviations from the optimal (high efficiency) operating regions. These tools are connected with plant data information and acquire real time data (flowrates, pressures, and temperatures) from the process streams, and can send them to rigorous process simulator in order to close mass and energy balances. This strategy can reconcile data and infers missing operational information, like some key performance indicators. These tools can also receive inspection data of equipment, obtained by mobile systems, to be used to identify deviations from the desired operational region. Finally, this paper will also present results and gains of the application of these tools, process, and equipment monitoring center for offshore platforms. This paper will show the benefits to improve equipment reliability and safety, thus reducing risks and losses due to possible equipment failure. It will also presents and discuss new tools and process to monitor critical equipment.

AB  - Abstract The current topic being discussed rigorously by all oil and gas operators is declining production rates. This has caused them to put more efforts into getting the oil out of their matured reservoirs including PETRONAS. One of the initiatives by PETRONAS recently was to undergo a short term production enhancement project. There were various recommendations and opportunities evaluated. Among them is the Low Pressure System, which was chosen due to its simplicity and mobility. The Low Pressure System or LPS in short, is a system that utilises the well test unloading concept, using the common well testing equipment package. It is relatively easy to assemble and is not a permanent structure and can be mobilised from one platform to another. The sizing of the equipment can be customised based on the deck space availability as well as the reservoir potential. Well candidates for the system are those with low tubing head pressure and flowing with biggest choke size as these wells are unable to flow due to the back pressure effect from the export pipeline. To date, two fields were tested and the gains were more than initially expected. One of the fields has had all of its idle wells flowing and producing more than 500bopd. This paper will share how the wells were selected, the results and challenges during the implementation of LPS. Introduction Across the world, production has gone pass peak oil. Clearly, the days of easy oil have long gone. With soaring demand and depleting reserves, every oil company in the world is scrambling to maximise their production. With matured oil fields, many wells are no longer producing i.e. idle or producing with very little oil. Not so much due to depleted reserves, but due to declining reservoir pressure. In Malaysia, this is no exception as it is estimated that more than 60% of the producing fields ¬†have been producing for more than 30 years. Therefore, continuous efforts are needed to ensure the production from these fields is maximised and optimum amount of recoverable oil is being extracted from these matured reservoirs. One of the many initiatives to optimise field reserves recovery that was introduced by PETRONAS recently was the Short Term Production Enhancement (STPE) Project. The project involved ten matured fields and the study period took two months to complete. It studied all the short term opportunities that can be implemented in the matured fields within the next 6 months.. Various opportunities were evaluated and several recommendations were considered and implemented as a result from the STPE study. One of them is the Low Pressure System, which was chosen for implementation due to two characteristics; simplicity and mobility. The Low Pressure System or LPS in short, is a system that utilises the well test unloading concept, using common well testing equipment package. The uniqueness of LPS is that it utilises old technology but repackaged as a new solution. What is LPS? Low Pressure System or LPS for short is an innovative total solution aimed at enhancing field production within a short time cycle. LPS is a unique integrated subsurface and surface approach encompasses engineering study, system design and system operation as shown in Fig. 1.

Abstract Beginning with the first gas well battery ratio control scheme in the early 1950's, present day design criteria is used to automate an-offshore gas well platform. Using the time domain technique simple mathematical expressions are employed to illustrate how any control system performance can be predicted before start-up. Introduction The petroleum industry's response to the increasing demand for natural gas has led to the exploration and production of more distant offshore gas and gas condensate fields. This in turn has focused increased interest in completely automated gas production and gas treatment platforms. Unfortunately,, past efforts to automate some platforms have not been 100 percent successful and a few producers view automatic control as a percent successful and a few producers view automatic control as a necessary evil to be avoided whenever possible. This paper covers some principle design faults which contribute to improper operation of control systems. Emphasis is placed on the basic fundamentals of measurement and control which must be followed to ensure safe, dependable and economic operations. Reference is made to `rules of thumb' for preliminary system design and how to avoid the measurement and control problems which often occur.

AB  - Abstract ESPs are a main type of artificial lift being used to unload current horizontal unconventional wells. Due to their high cost and high failure rate an operator must implement them in the most efficient manner possible. This paper addresses a way to create a solution to make ESPs more efficient by using compression at surface. Current ways of handling gas through ESPs are insufficient utilizing variable speed drives (VSDs). Additional gas handling equipment installed in ESPs have also encountered mixed results as designs continue to be tinkered to improve gas handling. One area that has not been researched extensively is utilizing compression to drawdown the casing annulus of a well on ESP. A preferential path of less static head pressure allows the gas to be drawn up the annulus rather than handled through the pump. Thereby alleviating gas handling problems in the ESP and raising the FL over the pump. The paper presents two case studies in Oklahoma involving ESP compression assistance up the annulus: one is a case study of an unconventional well of the Mississippi Lime with a low FL and moderate gas production, the second is an unconventional well in the Meramec formation with large amounts of gas production that was increased with the assistance of a compressor to the ESP. Data was collected over a six-week period and ESP performance is compared before and after the surface compressor installation for case 1. In case 2, well performance is compared for 3 different artificial lift setups: gas lift, ESP, and compression assisted ESP over a 3-month period. Both case studies show benefits for utilizing surface compression with an ESP. The biggest benefits were found to be increased production and reduced operating cost by extending ESP longevity.

AB  - Modern completion techniques have greatly increased the production rate capability of wells. Many wells have the potential to produce more liquid and gas, but the use of tubing anchors in certain wellbore locations chokes the gas flow up the casing and results in increased back pressure against the formation that restricts production from the well. A gaseous liquid column can form above the tubing anchor and cause high pressure in the gas below the tubing anchor that restricts the liquid and gas flow from the reservoir. Often times, low pump fillage and low production rates are blamed on a poor gas separator when actually the separator is operating efficiently and is separating the liquid from the gas. In the condition described, all of the liquid in the wellbore below the tubing anchor falls to the pump and is being removed by the pump. The problem is that high pressure in the gas column below the tubing anchor is restricting production from the well. Additional production is available if the high pressure that is restricting production from the formation is removed. The accumulation of a gaseous liquid column above the tubing anchor indicates that liquid exists above the tubing anchor when only free gas exists from the tubing anchor down to the pump. Limited liquid production falls down the casing wall while the casing annulus is almost completely filled with gas if the pump is set below the formation. Field testing using automated fluid level measurement equipment to perform fluid depression tests verifies that a gaseous liquid column exists above the tubing anchor and a gas column exists below the tubing anchor in some wells. This field data was acquired on several wells and is shown to verify the above analysis of the well‚Äôs performance. This fluid distribution condition is not general known. Locating the tubing anchor below the pump prevents this condition and will improve production in these wells.

AB  - This article, written by JPT Technology Editor Chris Carpenter, contains highlights of paper SPE 195450, ‚ÄúHorizontal Infill Well With AICDs Improves Production in Mature Field: A Case Study,‚Äù by Ilhami Giden, SPE, and Michael Nirtl, SPE, OMV Austria; Hans Thomas Maier, SPE, University of Leoben; and Ismarullizam Mohd Ismail, SPE, Tendeka, prepared for the 2019 SPE Europec featured at the 81st EAGE Annual Conference and Exhibition, London, 3‚Äì6 June. The paper has not been peer reviewed. This paper compares the performance of three mature-field horizontal infill wells, one of which is completed with autonomous inflow-control devices (AICDs). Two of the horizontal infill wells are targeting attic oil in an area with low risk of gas production; one of these two wells is completed with slotted liners and the other with AICDs. The third horizontal well was placed in an area with higher gas saturation. The AICDs were found to choke back a high amount of fluid and keep the water cut at a stable plateau¬†level. Field Introduction Matzen is a supermature oil field northeast of Vienna and is one of the largest onshore oil fields in Europe. The field consists of several stacked reservoirs, of which the 16th Tortonian horizon (16.TH) is the largest. The westernmost part of the 16.TH is called the Bockfliess area. In this area, 77 wells are currently active: 62 are production wells and 15 are injection wells. During 2011 to 2015, the last major field-redevelopment project in the area, with the objective of doubling the gross production rate, was executed. One goal of the project included a conversion from low-rate sucker rod pumps (SRPs) to high-rate electrical submersible pumps (ESPs). Horizontal infill wells were also drilled to optimize the ultimate recovery in the reservoir. The 16.TH sandstone reservoir lies between ‚Äì1490 and ‚Äì1455 m TVDss [total vertical depth subsea (i.e., total vertical depth minus the elevation above mean sea level of the depth reference point of the well)], with excellent permeability and an average porosity of 27%. Reservoir temperature¬†is 60¬∞C and current reservoir pressure is 120 bar. Oil gravity is 25¬†¬∞API, while oil viscosity is 5¬†cp. Average water cut exceeds 97%. AICD Technology In recent years, several different types of AICDs have been designed. The most common device types are fluidic-diode, electrical-resistivity, and rate-controlled-production (RCP). This paper covers the RCP type. The working principle of RCP AICDs differs from type to type. The Levitating-Disc AICD. The AICD that is installed in Well BO 208 is an improved version of the RCP. The design works on the principle of a levitating disc. The AICD valve restricts the flow rate of low-viscosity fluids. When gas or water flows through the AICD valve at the same drawdown, the velocity of the water and gas will increase, reducing the dynamic pressure and levitating the disc toward the inlet to choke the flow. The AICD valve is assembled as part of the sand-screen joint. The reservoir fluids enter the completion through the sand-screen filter and flow into the in-flow-control housing where the AICD is mounted. The fluids then flow into the production stream to the surface together with the production from the rest of the screens.

AB  - SummaryThis paper reviews the production system options available for the development of remote oil fields by unmanned facilities at the remote site. Various types of artificial-lift techniques, surface multiphase fluid pumping, and flowline systems are compared and the attributes of each system illustrated, including an evaluation of the useful operational envelope of each system and its economics.IntroductionFor remote oil wells or a group of small fields being produced through a central gathering facility (either onshore or offshore), the traditional options for field development have been natural flow, artificial-lift-assisted systems, or local separation with crude transfer pumps and gas-to-flare or gas-compression systems. With the recent development of the multiphase pump based on the twin-screw principle, new approaches are now available for field development. principle, new approaches are now available for field development. During 1985-86, in a joint venture of BP, Stothert and Pitt, Shell, and Mobil, with support from the Dept. of Trade and Industry, a multiphase pump rated for a suction volume of 40,000 B/D [265 m3/h] was field tested. This pump operated satisfactorily on a wide range of multiphase mixtures with gas volume fractions of up to 80 to 90 % for more than 3,000 hours. The principle of multiphase pumping of hydrocarbons has been demonstrated. The pumping of hydrocarbons has been demonstrated. The multiphase- pump characteristics are summarized in Table 1; typical performance curves are shown in Fig. 1. performance curves are shown in Fig. 1. As a supplementary technique, multiphase fluid pumping offers alternative field development strategies that may realize benefits through improvements in production systems' operability and flexibility and can increase field development opportunities.Case Studies of Production SystemsGeneral. To evaluate the performance of conventional artificial-lift systems and surface multiphase pumps in the development of remote fields, a reservoir and field model was developed as a base case that allowed sensible comparison of the options for that given context. Because a remote field or wellsite would be unmanned, local bulk gas/oil separation is not considered in this paper since that plant typically is not designed for unmanned operation. In this study, the well parameters were selected to he suitable for demonstrating natural flow, gas lift, and downhole pumping options. Consequently, the reservoir was specified to be undersaturated with a 40 degrees API [0.83-g/cm3] crude, and a middle-range GOR of 350 scf/bbl [63 std m3/m3]. This base case has the following key parameters: 40 degrees API [0.83-g/cm3] gravity, 350-scf/bbl [63-std-m3/m3] GOR, 0% water cut, 1,800-psia [12.41-MPa] bubblepoint, and 5,000-psi [34.47-MPa] bottomhole closed-in pressure, or reservoir pressure. This study also examines the sensitivities on the base case to increasing water cut and greater GOR. A vertical well was specified with 10,000 ft [3048 m] of 4.8-in. [122-mm]-ID tubing in a 7-in. [178-mm] bottomhole liner. To limit flowline pressure drop, an 8-in. [203-mm] -ID production flowline was selected, and because the wellsite has minimum processing facilities, the oil/gas processing and gas-lift compression plant is located at the central gathering center. The produced fluids arrive at the processing plant at 200 psi [1.38 MPa]. Fig. 2 illustrates the plant layout. plant layout. Case Studies. The objective of the study was to evaluate the useful operational envelopes of systems using natural flow. gas lift, downhole centrifugal pumps, and surface multiphase pump options. (See Refs. 2 and 3 for general observations on artificial-lift systems.) The main system characteristics evaluated were maximum flowline length, system power requirements, and the impact of water cut and increased GOR on system performance. The system options reviewed were natural flow, natural flow with surface multiphase pump, gas lift, gas lift with surface multiphase pump, electrical submersible pump (ESP), and ESP with surface pump, electrical submersible pump (ESP), and ESP with surface multiphase pump. Although alternative methods of downhole pumping are available, ESP's were chosen to simplify system pumping are available, ESP's were chosen to simplify system evaluation and because of their throughput and differential-pressure characteristics. The analysis technique was based on the nodal method described in Ref. 4.AnalysisIn the investigation of the technological limits for each of the cases (natural flow, gas lift, downhole pumps, and combination systems with surface multiphase pumps). production scenarios were set up to explore operational boundaries and to compare the performance of each system. The main parameters of the production system and the major plant items are as follows. The vertical well's flow ranged up to 10,000 B/D [66 m3/h] with 0 (initially) to 100% water cut. The PI was held constant at 5 bbl/(D-psi) [0.115 m3/(dkPa)]. The bottomhole temperature was 200 degrees F [93 degrees C]. The maximum power of the downhole ESP was 500 kW. The maximum differential pressure ranged up to 1,600 psi [11.03 MPa]. and the maximum operating temperature was 200 degrees F [93 degrees C]. The gas-lift injection pressure was as high as 3,000 psi [20.68 MPa]. For the multiphase pump, pressure was as high as 3,000 psi [20.68 MPa]. For the multiphase pump, the maximum differential pressure was 500 psi [3.45 MPa] and the maximum gas volume fraction was 90%. The horizontal flowlines minimum and maximum superficial liquid velocities were 1 and 35 ft/sec [0.305 and 10.67 m/s]. The produced fluids arrived at the separator at 200 psi [1.38 MPa], and the liquid flow rate was up to 10,000 B/D [66 m3/h] (typical of a North Sea marginal development). Liquid flow rates are based on barrels per day of stocktank liquidi.e., 100% dry oil in the base case. Fluid volumes are calculated from this datum at the various points in the system for specific cases. Within the calculations, liquid is treated as a single phase with bulk properties based on mass-fraction average oil and phase with bulk properties based on mass-fraction average oil and water physical properties. Note that to illustrate the general principles, the analysis was simplified and takes no account of the pressure losses resulting from subsurface valves and fittings. line chokes, etc. For this study, it was considered appropriate to calculate tubing pressure drop on the basis of true vertical flow because the scope of work was to evaluate the impact of the significant downhole and surface parameters. parameters. The same bottomhole flowing pressure was applied to each of the cases considered (for a liquid flow rate of 10,000 B/D [66 m3/h])i.e., 3,000 psi [20.68 MPa)and a PI of 5 bbl/(D-psi) [0.115 m3/(dkPa)]. Again, to simplify the analysis. the point of gas injection was at the bottom of the production tubing in each case. The quantity of gas injected. however. was optimized to maximize transmission distance vs. power consumption. It is recognized that for the reservoir characteristics chosen to demonstrate system concepts. the inherent drawdown would call for water injection or a natural aquifer to support reservoir pressure. Orkiszewski's correlation for vertical flow and Beggs and Brill's correlation for horizontal flow were used in our calculations. Although mechanistic models are being developed and tested, validation exercises to compare actual and predicted data for oil/gas systems suggest that these empirical correlations still give the most reliable results across a wide range of normal operating conditions.SPEPEP. 459

AB  - When during primary oil production the thermodynamic conditions within the well tubing lie inside the asphaltene deposition envelope (ADE) of the produced fluid, the flocculated asphaltene particles could start depositing on the tubing wall at a certain rate. The above causes a restriction in the tubing ID which results in loss of production. Higher choke settings are required to maintain the same production level until the choke is fully open and the production losses cannot be compensated by opening the choke further. Eventually, the well may ‚Ä≥bridge‚Ä≥ and stop flowing completely or continue flowing at an extremely small flow rate in a rather ‚Ä≥burping‚Ä≥ way where the flow starts and stops at different time intervals on its own volition. Understanding when and how to intervene not only diminishes the risk of unsuccessful or, even worst, detrimental operations but also may increase the well‚Äôs productivity throughout its life. This paper presents a methodology of first determining the ADE in the lab, along with the asphaltene particle size distribution as a function of pressure and temperature. Moreover, asphaltene deposition rates for the tubing conditions can be measured using high pressure and temperature coaxial cylinder technology. Utilizing this technique allows to quantify the amount of flocculated asphaltenes that will deposit under the expected conditions. From that data, it is illustrated how a well-equipped simulator can be, initially, tuned to predict the phase behavior measured in the lab along with the deposition rates. Finally, the simulator can then run the production scenarios available into the future, predicting the impact of asphaltene deposition in the tubing and the resulting loss of production and quantify the asphaltene deposit. It is apparent that this information can prove invaluable in the design of the well completion and flowline along with the facilities and help further refine the understanding of the expected production problems. This methodology is especially important in offshore satellite tieback wells expected to undergo asphaltene deposition.

The paper has not been peer reviewed. This paper describes the architecture of the Lucius Gulf of Mexico subsea production system and the drivers behind it. Novel technologies are detailed, and innovative installation techniques and highlights are described, including a ‚Äústrong-back‚Äù system for rigid jumpers. Difficulties and lessons learned are also shared. Introduction The Lucius field is located in water depths ranging from 6,800 to 7,100 ft. Lucius has been developed with six initial subsea wells split between two 8-in.-nominal production loops, each with a six-well manifold. The system is designed for a maximum-allowable operating pressure of 9,300 psi. An early discovery well is located away from the well clusters and is daisy chained into the west-manifold flowline loop. Two other delineation wells are produced back to the east manifold with short-stepout flowlines. The step-out wells add some flow-assurance complexity. Unfortunately, permitting restrictions drove the location of one of the step-out wells. The other was drilled by another operator and later was captured by the development with unitization. It is expected that all future wells will be located adjacent to one of the two manifolds. System Overview The system relies heavily on the operator‚Äôs subsea-hardware supply-chain alliances for standardized building blocks. A flow test was used to obtain additional reservoir information to help move the project forward to sanction. The discovery well was completed with a stock tree and controls for the flow test. This well and the equipment are now part of the completed system.

AB  - Modern completion techniques have greatly increased the production-rate capability of wells. Many wells have the potential to produce more liquid and gas, but the use of tubing anchors in certain wellbore locations chokes the gas flow up the casing and results in increased backpressure against the formation, which restricts production from the well. A gaseous liquid column can form above the tubing anchor and cause high pressure in the gas below the tubing anchor that restricts the liquid and gas flow from the reservoir. Often, low pump fillage and low production rates are blamed on a poor gas separator, when actually the separator is operating efficiently and is separating the liquid from the gas. In the condition described, all of the liquid in the wellbore below the tubing anchor falls to the pump and is being removed by the pump. The problem is that high pressure in the gas column below the tubing anchor is restricting production from the well. Additional production is available if the high pressure that is restricting production from the formation is removed. The accumulation of a gaseous liquid column above the tubing anchor when constant low pump fillage is observed indicates that liquid exists above the tubing anchor whereas only free gas exists from the tubing anchor down to the pump. Limited liquid production falls down the casing wall, while the casing annulus is almost completely filled with gas if the pump is set below the formation McCoy et al. 2013). Field testing with automated fluid-level-measurement equipment to perform liquid-depression tests verifies that a gaseous liquid column exists (Rowlan et al. 2008) above the tubing anchor and a gas column exists below the tubing anchor in wells with high fluid levels, with low pump fillage, and with the tubing anchor located above the pump. These field data was acquired on several wells and are shown to verify the preceding analysis of the well‚Äôs performance. This fluid-distribution condition is not generally known. Locating the tubing anchor below the pump prevents this condition and will improve production in these wells.

AB  - Abstract Water hammer, or more properly ‚Äòliquid hammer‚Äô simulations are commonly performed with transient simulation software. However, care must be taken in the setup of such simulations to assure good fidelity with the field operation being simulated. Of critical importance is the realization that a sudden pipeline shutdown has a symmetry where a pressure reduction (which can easily result in the creation of a vacuum strong enough to pull gas out of solution, followed by explosive recompression of that resultant gas phase) occurs at the inlet of the pipe equal in magnitude to the pressure surge at the outlet. Much can be done with ‚Äòpencil-and-paper‚Äô calculations, including a worst-case estimate of surge pressures using the Joukowsky Equation. This equation can be further modified to account for elasticity, as would occur, for example, in a tanker loading hose ‚Äì in fact, this modification is essential to obtain the correct behavior from the simulation models. This paper presents transient simulations, along with comparisons to pencil-and-paper equations and theory, to come up with a best-practices approach to water hammer modeling.

AB  - Abstract A new processing workflow has been engineered to combine reservoir deliverability, defined by production logging (PL) measurements, with nodal analysis evaluation. This allows the effects of various completion modifications to be quantitatively modeled, predicting the resulting changes in well production prior to intervention. A graphical computer interface is used to implement the workflow and facilitate comparisons of the effect on production of multiple completion/recompletion scenarios, using "drag and drop?? icons for placing simulated plugs, patches, perforations, etc. on the base profile. Beginning with the flow profile and formation pressure, the process defines zonal reservoir parameters in terms of the productivity index, water cut, and gas/oil ratio.¬† These data are passed transparently to a nodal analysis package that automatically creates a model to match the measured rates and pressures as closely as possible to allow production computations. The process is designed to significantly decrease workover decision time and risk.¬† This technique provides opportunities to compare and recommend formation evaluations, profile modifications, various artificial lift options, and stimulation activities to maximize production. The modified completion is then passed to the nodal analysis engine and a new predicted production profile is computed and displayed. Outputs include graphic and ASCII format log data, ASCII format tables, and data files, which can be used for further studies. In this paper, the use of the workflow is demonstrated by one example and two case studies, including a selective inflow performance analysis of a gas well and a successful water shutoff operation in an oil well. PL answers provide an opportunity to evaluate the downhole flow performance of multizone completions. Nodal analysis techniques provide a method to model the effects of the fluid properties and completion configuration as the fluids are produced to the surface.¬† Combining PL answers seamlessly with nodal analysis provides unique insight into the reservoir completion performance and production improvement potential. Introduction A workflow will be discussed that permits the combination of PL data with nodal analysis. This method is used to rapidly screen worker scenarios to optimize the performance of the well when planning an intervention. The workflow, based on production log data, has been automated and computerized to speed up the planning of remedial wellbore operations and reduce the risk of failure of such interventions. The workflow user does not need advanced knowledge of nodal analysis techniques or software, because as the nodal model is set up automatically from the PL data and well sketch, which greatly speeds up the process. Being able to examine a range of wellbore intervention options using the workflow before any actual intervention reduces the risk of a workover failure and allows an optimal workover to be planned. The example workflow mentioned earlier demonstrates the technique and the two case studies present actual field usage. Production Logging Techniques Production logging is used to determine both single and multiphase fluid entry profiles in both producing wells and injectors. The primary information derived from PL data is a record of pressure, temperature, and flow rate versus depth. This lets us know which zones in the well are producing; what phases (oil, water, and gas) are being produced; and whether there are any nonproducing intervals. In shut-in wells, we can also look for crossflow between various reservoir layers.

AB  - Abstract In 2009, QGC (a BG Group business) first planned to produce coal seam gas (CSG) in the Surat Basin as feedstock for a new Liquefied Natural Gas (LNG) plant.¬† Subsurface models and associated field development plans were generated to underpin the investment case for the Queensland Curtis LNG (QCLNG) Project. This paper discusses history matching experience from QGC‚Äôs Surat Basin reservoir simulation models, the challenges involved, and how these challenges have been overcome. Similar to conventional reservoirs, full-field numerical simulation is necessary to accurately account for well interference and broader reservoir connectivity. Simulationalso fully integrates modelled 3D static property variations and honours the physics of multi-phase flow through porous media. CSG reservoirs possess unique characteristics which differ from conventional reservoirs and tend to increase the challenge of history matching. Some of these challenges include the physics of diffusive flow from the matrix into fractures that combines with relative permeability to create a more complex multi-phase flow problem. ¬†Another challenge is the requirement to de-water the coal before gas production commences and the associated stress dependency of coal properties. At the same time, the nature of CSG developments makes conventional history-matching approaches impractical given the ¬†large number of wells and the need for quick turnaround and fast-cycle decision making, especially during development ramp-up. These demands are set against a lean business environment where cost efficiency is paramount. The properties of Walloon Subgroup (WSG) coals in the Surat Basin are unique compared to other CSG basin plays worldwide. The WSG is characterised by low to moderate coal rank, highly interbedded seams distributed through an extremely low permeability inter-burden, and highly variable coal permeability throughout the basin. Some of these differentiating properties of the WSG make history matching these reservoirs very challenging. This paper presents guidelines for overcoming these challenges and history-matching CSG production in a dynamic simulation model of the Surat basin WSG. Handling of uncertainty is discussed to consider a range of possible history-matches for 345 wells with 9 years of production history. The history matching guidelines that have been developed are enabling a faster turnaround of model predictions, capturing key uncertainty parameters and informing field development decision-making. Keywords Simulation, CSG, History-matching, Surat Basin Introduction QGC has been producing CSG within the Surat Basin in South-East Queensland since 2005 and is developing the QCLNG project.¬†¬† The associated petroleum tenures are broadly split between three core development areas.¬† One of those development areas contains the majority of the production history to date, and is the focus area for this paper.¬† To date in this area 345 wells have been produced into the domestic market.¬† In total, more than 2,000 wells have been drilled to date by QGC and more than 1,100 have been connected to facilities with more wells to be drilled in the future.

AB  - Abstract Several correlations have been developed to predict wellhead pressure‚Äìproduction rate relationship in the Niger Delta region. Regrettably, most of these correlations were developed from field data that are not from the Niger Delta region and with limited field test data ranges, so their predictions are lower than expected field values when applied to the Niger Delta. Additionally, some developed wellhead pressure‚Äìproduction rate correlations based on Niger Delta field data are made using in-house equations by the operating companies in the Niger Delta region. To ameliorate this anomaly, sixty four (64) field test data: choke size (S), production rate (q), gas-liquid ratio (GLR), flowing wellhead pressure (Pwh), flowing temperature (FTHP) and basic sediment and water (BS&W) were collected from oil producing wells in the Niger Delta region to develop wellhead pressure‚Äìproduction rate correlations based on Gilbert correlation and modified Gilbert equations. The developed correlations using Niger Delta field test data were compared with several authors' correlations. The results obtained indicate that the developed correlations resulted in better predictions than earlier correlations. In addition, the statistical analysis of the developed correlations used to ascertain the extent of their predicted values differ from the field test data and resulted in average error, absolute error and standard deviation of -0.1477, 0.4430 and 0.9582 for Gilbert formula and -0.2515, 0.4737 and 1.0997 for modified Gilbert formula, respectively. Furthermore, the developed correlations are comparable with an average correlation coefficient of 0.9869. Therefore, the developed correlations can be used as a quick tool to estimate the wellhead pressure‚Äìproduction rate relationship in Niger Delta oil fields.

AB  - One of the advantages of looking into the future is that you can make almost any prediction without fear of being contradicted, and it is virtually certain that by the time the events which one has forecast have failed to come to pass, few will remember you and even fewer will care. However, I do not intend, today, to indulge too much in crystal ball gazing, but rather to project forward as realistically as I can along the lines of our experience so far in Northern Alaska. We now stand at a decisive moment in the development of North Slope oil and gas, and while I am confident that development will proceed, what is not at all certain is the pace. The unsettled land claims of Alaskan Natives and the resulting restriction on land use have dealt a severe economic setback to the State of Alaska and its natural resource development. We hope the Legislation currently before Congress will be adopted and open the way for positive administrative actions affecting Alaska. The prompt resolution of these problems is vital not only to further progress but, more urgently, to halt the backward economic trend already evident in the State. I shall touch on these matters later on, but at this moment in time it is impossible to overemphasize the difficulty of accurately predicting Alaska's development until these matters are settled.First, let me go over some of the history of oil and gas development in Northern Alaska. It is widely believed outside of Government and Industry, according to some newspapers at least, that oil development on the North Slope started in 1968. Much has been written of \"oil rushes\" boom and bust\" bonanzas and \"quick profit\", but the truth is really quite different.The early stages of exploration on the North Slope were carried out almost entirely by the U.S. Geological Survey which produced the first report on the area in 1904. After President Harding had, in 1923, created Naval Petroleum Reserve #4, which covers more than half of the sedimentary basin, there was a further burst of work by the Geologica1 Survey in the period from 1923-1926. During the Second World War when there was grave concern about the security of oil supplies, an intensive exploration effort was mounted in and around NPR-4 by the U..S. Navy with the .U.S.G..S. acting as prime contractor in the work. This intensive program consisted of geological and geophysical surveys and drilling lasted from 1944 to 1953 and cost at least $43 million. Forty-five shallow core tests and thirty-six test wells were drilled with a total footage of about 175,000 feet. As a result of this intensive, and may I say skillfu1ly .conducted exploration effort, several small oi1 and gas fields were found. In 1958 the Federal Government began a policy of oil leasing on the North Slope and so instituted a new phase of exploration with the greater part of the work being carried out by the oil companies.

AB  - ABSTRACT:Abstract title: Sand production - Sand Monitoring and Management Measurement is a cornerstone of any sand management system. Sand production in oil and gas wells is one of the most challenging factors an operator faces during production. Sand and particles can be the reason for low productivity, and a cutback in production in the range of 20 to 75% is fairly common in oil and gas wells. Produced sand can never be ignored. Any well producing from a sandstone reservoir needs to have some sort of sand monitoring system in place, preferably online and with real-time readings. By use of non-invasive sand monitoring equipment the operators can save millions of USD. The increased expences when going subsea, in conjunction with the need to produce as much as possible per well, makes the selection of a subsea monitoring system even more important. ClampOn has been working on the issues of sand production and sand monitoring for more than a decade, helping clients all over the world to measure and Understand it. Our experience from thousands of wells has given us a unique practical knowledge on how sand production will appear and how it can be measured and dealt with in an efficient way. This presentation includes field examples demonstrating the earnings made

AB  - Abstract Total production analysis is currently in use in oil field operations assisting the optimization of production to ensure the maximum profitability. profitability. The Khafji Field, being an oil field situated in the offshore Saudi Arabia, has been producing oil from more than 100 wells for the past 30 years. Oil flows from the wellhead jacket to the two-phase separator on the offshore flow station (gas oil separation platform). After flowing to the pump station oil is transmitted through the pump station oil is transmitted through the transmission line to the onshore facilities. Some wells are gas lifted and the production water cut is on the increase. Water cut will definitely intensify with the increase in gas lift operation. The review and evaluation of the offshore facilities, from the individual wellhead to the inlet of offshore separator, is essential so as to optimize oil production. This paper outlines the field application of production system analysis. The flow through production system analysis. The flow through the wellhead choke and the flow through the pipeline have been investigated using actual pipeline have been investigated using actual field data and the technical correlation for these flows have been established. A review discussion is offered concerning the identification of the bottleneck in the existing production facilities which at present time, acts production facilities which at present time, acts as a serious restraint on oil production. The problems encountered in carrying out this problems encountered in carrying out this investigation are outlined and, specifically, the solution for the bottleneck problem to optimize production within the limits of existing facilities production within the limits of existing facilities are discussed at length. Finally guidelines are proposed for future facility design and proposed for future facility design and modification. Introduction The Khafji field is situated in the offshore Saudi Arabia, about 40 km east from Al-Khafji, Saudi Arabia (Figure-1). The field was originally discovered in 1960 and started production in 1961 as Khafji crude. The main producing zone among the five developed zones is the sandstone reservoir at depths between 4800 and 5500 feet, and having a strong water drive. The cumulative oil production for Khafji crude as of end of 1990 is production for Khafji crude as of end of 1990 is around 2.6 billion bbls. Most of the permanent production facilities for Khafji crude were constructed in 1961 and were designed for conditions as they existed at that time. As the field was developed, the numbers of wells and flowlines were increased. P. 699

AB  - Abstract Process disturbances may cause reduction in production as the necessary margins to process constraints need to take peak values into account. If the process disturbances can be suppressed, it is possible to operate closer to constraints resulting in higher production. For both injection and production wells, process disturbance rejection is typically achieved with automatic choke control, which is also beneficial for efficiently achieving changing target values. Good control requires accurate and up-to-date measurements. For cases where no reliable physical sensor is available, robust soft sensor design is a key element in the well control solution. The process disturbances caused by natural fluctuations of the underlying process require frequent adjustments of the well chokes to maintain key parameters at their desired values. If wells are choked to ensure operation within given constraints, it is normally beneficial to implement automatic choke control since this enables operation closer to these constraints. The control target may also be to track a calculated downhole pressure trajectory during well restart. A smooth restart is important for some wells to avoid excessive sand production. In addition, automatic actions can be taken to reduce the risk of safety issues. This paper presents field experience as perceived by a control engineer from applying automatic choke control to a large number of water injectors to stabilize the downhole injection pressure or injection rate and application of automatic control for production chokes to control downhole pressure. During restarts of production wells, the downhole pressure follows a pressure trajectory set point to minimize pressure fluctuations to avoid excessive sand production. Exchanging manual infrequent choke manipulations with automatic control to keep the process close to the true, physical constraints, enables safe and optimal production.

AB  - Abstract: Initial startup of a subsea development is one of the most challenging periods in the operational life of the facility.¬† Many issues complicate this period.¬† These include: -¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† People issues: a great many people from many teams are required to execute a startup; roles and responsibilities may be unclear and will change over the course of the startup; persons on board (POB) issues limit the number of people who can participate; personnel involved may not be fully trained in the operation of the facility. -¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† This will be the first time much or all of the equipment is used in live hydrocarbon service.¬†¬† Design flaws, commissioning omissions and infant mortalities will rear their heads.¬† -¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† Preserving completion integrity requires low rates and slow bean-ups during initial startup because of high formation skin.¬† Chokes designed for high rates and low pressure drops may not be capable of controlling the well at low rates.¬† Also, topsides systems designed for peak rates may not function well at low flowrates. -¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† Low flowrates and low initial temperatures result in hydrate risk which may challenge the flow assurance strategy.¬† -¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† Completion and stimulation fluids returned during the initial well cleanup are corrosive and are difficult to treat.¬† Specialized water treatment equipment is typically installed temporarily on topsides to treat these fluids.¬†¬† -¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† Solids from the reservoir and from construction debris may cause problems such as plugging small ports in control valves.¬† -¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† Drilling, construction, installation and commissioning activities (SIMOPS) may still be in progress.¬† The exact state of equipment items may be unclear and may change over the course of the startup.¬† -¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† Special procedures are usually written for the initial startup.¬† These will differ in important ways from the normal operating procedures.¬† Risks exist that there may be errors in the startup procedures, that operators may err in implementing the procedures,¬† that equipment designed for normal operating will not function well at the conditions imposed by the startup.¬† -¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† Reservoir Engineers will seek to obtain reservoir information via well tests, especially pressure build-up tests.¬† These tests are sensitive and are easily disrupted by operator actions during the tests.¬† -¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† Some regulatory requirements apply specifically to the startup period.

AB  - Abstract Sabiriyah Lower Burgan is a clastic reservoir in North Kuwait on continuous production for the last 45 years. The reservoir, on active water drive, has its inherent problem of rapid increase in water cut, the production performance of wells declining drastically after water cut level of 40%. The well production improvement is continuous effort based on understanding of well fundamentals and actual analysis of well's historical performance. This can be enhanced with Well modeling based on latest field real time parameters to predict well performance and production forecast. The persistent approach to improve well performance was implemented by dividing entire Field into segments based on water encroachment, pressure distribution and fluid properties as each well is located in a segment requiring specific approach and technique's to sustain well production and performance improvement. To implement production sustenance and enhancement plan, huge well surveillance plan was adopted to acquire TDT/PNC, PLT, FBHP and SBHP, PGOR to get latest well and field data to implement following specific actions a) Quick wins: Rig less water shut-off jobs, additional and re-perforations in dry zones to improve well production; b) Rig work overs to cement squeeze the high water cut zones to reduce water cuts and improve well vertical lift performance on natural flow; c) Selective ESP in low pressure and high water cut field segments to sustain the existing production; d)¬† Use of latest ICD design based on PLT results to sustain well production from the existing horizontal wells with less water cut; e) Re-completion of poor performance¬† wells of other zones after critical evaluation. The case history of Production management of this giant reservoir in North Kuwait leading to significant increase in production is a successful journey to be shared with International professional community. ¬† Background Sabiriyah Lower Burgan is a clastic reservoir in North Kuwait on continuous production for the last 45 years. The reservoir, on active water drive, has its inherent problem of rapid increase in water cut, the production performance of wells declining drastically after water cut level of 40%. The well production improvement is continuous effort based on understanding of well fundamentals and actual analysis of well's historical performance. This can be enhanced with Well modeling based on latest field real time parameters to predict well performance and production forecast. Lower Burgan is a prolific reservoir with natural aquifer support. The crude oil quality produced from the reservoir is of light quality with an average API gravity of about 33 degree and % Sulphur of less than 2.8%.¬† The reservoir has cumulatively produced about 750 mmstb of oil so far. The long term production aspirations from SA LB to the asset is quite significant, once planned infill drilling of horizontal wells is complete. The reservoir is being produced with 75% producers on natural flow and 25% producers on ESP at a daily rate of about 70-80 mbopd with an average water cut of about 47%.

AB  - Abstract Production logging is difficult in complex well designs such as horizontal multilateral (ML) wells with jagged level-two exits. The ML exits can obstruct the access of logging tools due to damage around the milled windows. Once inside a low-flow high-water cut reservoir, the challenge becomes measuring an oil inflow profile in stratified flow. The access issue is worse in sub-hydrostatic wells completed with artificial lift. Horizontal gas lifted wells are easily choked by the presence of coiled tubing (CT). Y-Tools can be deployed in electrical submersible pump (ESP) wells to provide bypass tubing for logging strings necessary to log while pumping, although the system has not been successful in low rate wells due to re-circulation across the dynamic seal in the Y-Tool. This recirculation invalidates the log data and overheats the motor. As in gas lift completions, the low rate ESP completions also suffer rate reduction caused by the presence of CT. This paper describes the methods used to overcome these access and production logging challenges in North Oman. A new tool configuration that comprises a vertical array of mini spinners and fluid type sensors was used to detect a 2% oil hold-up in a stratified flow. It has a surface controlled collapsible spinner cage that makes the tool slick to maneuver around obstructions in the well. This has overcome some of the level 2 bypass problems in ML wells. A temporary ESP and Y-tool upper completion has been used to log a 3-leg ML backbone successfully. To fix the recirculation problem, a modified Y-tool plug was designed to reduce the fluid leakage in the dynamic seal. A variable speed drive (VSD) at surface controlled the ESP motor speed, adjusting the pump rate to compensate for the rate reduction caused by the presence of the CT. Wireline conveyed tractors have overcome some of the choking limitations of CT in gas lifted wells. Openhole completions remain a challenge. Introduction There are numerous challenges for the well and reservoir management engineer who wants to acquire production logs (PLT) in brown fields. Often the wells were not constructed with intervention in mind, and as the water cut gets high it becomes a challenge to detect the oil at all. Drilling methods and the understanding of multiphase fluid dynamics such as stratified flow have improved since the first horizontal wells were drilled in the early 1990s. Now we know it is best to avoid undulations in the trajectory of these wells to minimize water sumps and gas pockets, and to provide a straighter well for deeper reach with CT. Also, fluid entries can be masked by the hold up changes created by these deviation changes. Nowadays, several technologies have enabled holes to be drilled much closer to true horizontal, for example near bit continuous inclination and rotary steerable systems. However it is the old horizontal wells with undulations that have the high water cuts today, and are often the focus of well and reservoir management. Multilateral wells were the next step in maximizing contact with the reservoir from one wellhead. Recent multilateral well designs may have fluid control devices on each lateral, with a production test of each leg possible from surface. However the early designs only have open hole branches, or milled casing exits into open hole laterals. In these wells even logging the backbone can be a challenge. Openhole completions present another set of difficulties, especially if the well is not cleaned up at the time of logging as in Figure¬†1. The most difficult wells are long horizontal holes drilled in sub-hydrostatic reservoirs with a high water cut. These wells present significant access problems when there is insufficient fluid viscosity and velocity to circulate residual mudcake and shale debris to surface. The shale debris is released from water exposure or stress related washouts. This creates challenges for any logging device that has external moving parts such as spinners. Reservoir pressure maintenance with water flooding in brown fields has led to an increased requirement for artificial lift due to high water production. As these wells become more sub hydrostatic gas lift is no longer enough to generate the required flowrates, hence more intrusive forms of artificial lift are installed such as ESPs, positive cavity pumps (PCP) and beam pumps (BP). Pump bypass systems have been developed for these wells to regain production-logging access, however these were not designed for low rate wells.

AB  - SPE Members Abstract This study deals with projecting production decline curves. It examines a generalized relationship of cumulative production versus time presented in the literature by Gentry . production versus time presented in the literature by Gentry . A production rate versus time relationship is derived from this general equation. Four methods of determining the constants appearing in both equations is presented. The equations are used to model solution-gas drive production (simulated and actual field case studies). The goal is to determine the utility of using the equations to evaluate solution-gas drive reservoirs. HISTORICAL DEVELOPMENT Several methods have been presented in the literature for mathematically predicting, by extrapolation, the future production rates of a producing property. The extrapolation of the production rate versus time curve (to predict future production rates) is commonly termed decline curve analysis due to the declining nature of primary production. One of the most important contributions to decline curve analysis was a paper published by Arps in 1945. Arps presented both a production rate - time relationship and a production rate- cumulative production relationship. These empirical relationships are presented in the first four columns of Table 1. The ranges of the decline exponent, 1/h, can be seen for the three classes of declines (exponential, hyperbolic, and harmonic). The equations are all solutions of thin differential equation (1) where q is the production rate, t is the time, a is the decline parameter, 1/h is the decline exponent, and K is a constants parameter, 1/h is the decline exponent, and K is a constants Gentry presented a simplified method for the solution and extrapolation of hyperbolic production decline equations. The method involves the determination of dimensionless production parameters qi/qt and Np/qi t. The hyperbolic: equations were manipulated to solve for unknowns in terms of the dimensionless production parameters. The equations are presented in columns five and six of Table 1. Figs: 1 and 2 were developed to allow for quick graphical evaluation of the hyperbolic decline exponent, 1/h, and the initial decline rate, qi. Various reservoir parameters have been studied to determine those which may effect the decline exponent 1/h in the hyperbolic equations. Gentry attributes changes in the decline exponent to changes in production policy, reservoir heterogeneity and other factors. Fetkovich et al. concluded in a study of cases histories that "the misuse of the Arps equation with transient data generally results in overly optimistic forecasts and is technically incorrect." The transient flow period may last as long as three years in certain formations and, in Fetkovich's opinion, must be disregarded if an accurate evaluation is to be generated. P. 101

AB  - Abstract This paper provides a case study of an intervention effort which returned to production three wells that had been on extended shut in, two subsea and one dry tree, in a mature BP operated Gulf of Mexico deepwater field. The three wells involved in this operation had been shut in due to incidences of sand production. The production facility was not designed with any sand management capability such as hydrocyclones, sand jets, etc. Thus, historically, any incidence of sand production led to a well shut in. The objective of this intervention was to evaluate integrity of the completions and the remaining production potential of each of the wells. As deepwater and subsea fields mature, intervention and surveillance options on subsea wells have to be explored and developed. Several operational challenges were faced during the planning and execution of this operation due to the sand prone nature of the wells combined with the subsea environment. They were carefully assessed and the risks were effectively managed in order to return all three wells to production. Field Background Pompano is currently the oldest BP operated facility in the Gulf of Mexico with first production in 1994. The facility was developed with 33 dry tree wells and a 10 well subsea template tieback to the fixed jacket platform. The template is tied to the platform via two subsea flow loops, one 8?? insulated loop for normal production and one 3?? uninsulated loop for well testing and well servicing purposes (Figure 1). Pompano's production peaked at about 65,000 BOPD in 1999. By July 2007, total field production was approximately 11,500 BOPD. Maintaining the existing production and minimizing field decline has become more critical than ever. Low cost, high return well intervention work is key to maximizing the value of this field. The challenge for the Pompano team is to identify and successfully implement unique and creative production enhancement activities. At the forefront of this search is a rigorous effort to revisit and recover production from shut in wells. Well Histories This intervention focused on three shut in wells, two subsea (TB-03, TB-07) and one dry tree well (A-03). The TB-03 well was initially shut in due to Hurricane Katrina in September 2005. The well remained shut in for almost 5 months as a result of this event. Prior to this shut in, the well was producing 930 BOPD, 480 BWPD, and 1.09 MMSCFD. A start up was attempted in January 2006. Upon start up, the well produced about half a cup of solids in 8 hours. Shake outs during this period showed between a trace and 10 percent of solids in the flow stream. At this time, the well was shut in until further analysis could be done on the produced solids. The results from lab analysis of the produced solids showed that these solids were fine grained and could have been produced through the type of frac pack completion in the TB-03 well. This was positive indication that integrity of the completion might still remain and the well could be restored to production.

AB  - Abstract Decline curve analysis is a graphical procedure used for analyzing declining production rates, and forecasting future performance of oil and gas wells. This is achieved by curve fitting the past production performance using the rate-time data and extrapolating it to predict future performance, with the primary aim of estimating reservoir remaining reserves and/or remaining productive life. The effective use of the forecast techniques: Empirical, Fetkovich, Locke & Sawyer, and Analytical Transient solutions for oil and gas wells/Reservoirs, using a production surveillance tool that manages multi-wells effectively in less time is discussed. The last three techniques-type-curves require good understanding of the reservoir model as well as the parameters controlling the well behaviour. To effectively use any of these techniques for forecasting future production, it is imperative to determine the dominant flow regime from the production data. This paper focuses on concepts that enable engineers determine the dominant flow regime from diagnostic plots generated from rate-time data and/or numerical iterative method. Once we are able to establish the dominant flow regime, we can now decide which of these techniques to be used. Finally, the concepts were applied to field rate-time data. Introduction Decline curve analysis (DCA) as one of the methods of production rate-time data analysis has advanced significantly, over the past years. This paper starts with the basic theories of Decline Curve Analysis based on the assumption that "whatever causes controlled the trend of a curve in the past will continue to govern its trend in the future in a uniform manner?? and proceed to detailed explanation of the DCA associated models available in most production decline surveillance tools. There is clarification on when and where to reinitialise time to zero on the data points and also a discussion on how to determine the dominant flow regime from the production data. The sequential and systematic application of these concepts in a field case gives consistent and reliable results. This is evident in the results obtained from different techniques (including dynamic simulation) when compared with production information.

AB  - Abstract Reservoir uncertainties, increasing water cut, vertical lift performance, well integrity issue along with decline in production are some of the typical challenges of a mature asset. These coupled with ageing facilities and lower production efficiencies are key issues that an operator faces while operating any mature asset. Production decline from a mature field cannot be fully arrested. However, it can be reasonably controlled by using real-time optimisation techniques. This paper deliberates on how BG India has been able to address these issues successfully while operating mature assets in Mumbai offshore region. This paper presents how real-time production data, performance monitoring and application of innovative techniques can help in adding extra barrels to production. In the past few years, oil industry has been moving towards Real-Time Optimisation (RTO). However, to achieve optimal benefit from RTO, a new implementation approach-based on People Process Technology (PPT) framework has also been proposed in this paper. This paper recommends innovative practices like integrating non-technical disciplines, for e.g. Logistics, Planning, Contracts and Procurement etc into core production enhancement team. It also presents techniques to setup required processes to complement the traditional way of production opportunity and loss management. Furthermore, an outline has been presented on how to select the suitable technologies during the state-of-the-art Real-Time Optimisation Centre (RTOC) set up for any Oil and Gas asset. Several case studies have also been included in the paper to highlight the benefits from a RTOC based on PPT framework to manage the typical challenges of a mature asset. Using this approach, BG India has been able to reduce decline in production while achieving high production efficiency of more than 90 percent in the last three years for its fields in Mumbai offshore region. Going forward, more and more assets worldwide are likely to enter into the mature stage of lifecycle. Methods suggested in this paper provide a unique approach to implement a strategy to shift production management culture from reactive to proactive domain.

AB  - AbstractThis paper presents a case history on new sandstone acidizing technology using a nonhydrofluoric formulation to successfully treat a high carbonaceous sandstone formation. The improved understanding of the chemical complications of hydrofluoric (HF) on dirty sandstones led to the design of a nonhydrofluoric treatment on the high carbonate content (dirty) sandstone formation.Previous treatments using various formulations of HF acid failed to remove the high skin associated with several wells in this formation. A new approach was taken to identify the damage mechanism and evaluate damage removal options based on the formation mineralogy. This approach analyzed the potential chemistry risks associated with using HF type treatments in the presence of particular mineralogies and temperatures.The new approach also used logging and reservoir modeling technology to forecast the estimated production profile of the complex multilayered formation. Candidate wells were identified by comparing the forecast production profile potentials to the surveyed production profiles based on production logging (PLT) of the prescreening candidates. The final treatment candidate was then selected for the trial of the new treatment formulation. The treatment was specifically tailored based on the identified mineralogy and encompassed the damage prevention strategies. The result was a 40% increase in oil production for the well, but a 2-fold to 10-fold increase for the treated zone, depending on pretreatment production assumptions.IntroductionXJG oilfields are located offshore in the South China Sea around 130 km southeast of Hong Kong.1 The fields are composed of three geological structures named XJG 1, XJG 2 and XJG 3, the first one being discovered in 1984 and targeting sands from the mid-Miocene XH formation and finding up to 44 stacked reservoirs bearing black oil. Appraisal wells were drilled and tested; commercial production started in 1994 following the installation of two platforms.Oil gravity varies from 26¬∞ to 40¬∞ API, saturating unconsolidated sandstones with average porosity of 25% and permeability measured in a Darcy plus range. The formation is prone to produce sand, and typical completions at the beginning exhibited internal gravel packs inside a 9 5/8-in. casing, but recently shifted over to expandable sand screens in open hole making water control difficult to achieve. Reservoir pressure has been strongly supported by a bottom water drive aquifer, which has kept the pressure only a few psi below its original value. The water drive has helped to sweep hydrocarbons, but on the other hand, has also caused rapid breakthrough in high permeability layers.Electrical submersible pumps (ESPs) are used in all wells in the field to improve productivity and handle high volumes of water. Field average water cut at this stage is around 84% with a total field liquid production close to the limit of fluid handling capacity of the facilities. XJG reservoirs are being developed using two fixed platforms. As of this writing, all 24 available slots on platform XJG-2 have already been drilled and completed, while XJG-3 has one slot left available for an extended reach drilling (ERD) well in the near future. This situation limits the option of infill drilling to accelerate oil recovery.The combination of high permeable formation streaks and active aquifer accelerates water breakthrough in perforated zones, raising the average field water-cut. The oil production is near 85,000 BOPD while total fluid production is close to the 550,000 BFPD capacity of fluid handling and water disposal of the existing surface facilities on the platforms. Production logging is performed on a regular basis to monitor zonal fluid contribution. Reservoir zones are isolated by external packers and flowing through sliding side doors (SSD) valves. Water control is achieved by closing the SSDs to the high water-cut zones, but it is hard to determine exactly where the water is coming from or how much hydrocarbon has been left across the perforated intervals grouped in that zone.

AB  - Abstract In order to make effective decisions for oil field management, well and reservoir surveillance data needs to be utilized to better understand how the subsurface and surface systems in a field interact. This can be done at the reservoir, well and surface facility level, but is most effective when considering the entire production or injection system. IPM (Integrated Production Modeling) is now being used more often and, has demonstrated its usefulness in many oil and gas field applications. The use of integrated production modeling methodologies for improving production, identifying and eliminating bottlenecks and improving production allocation for wells from multiple reservoirs from both onshore and offshore oil fields are presented. Methods for coupling the surface and subsurface are reviewed and its usefulness for identifying bottlenecks at both the well and surface facility level are demonstrated. Field examples are presented where issues were identified and overcome by operational means and, found to increase production. Prioritization of wells and production intervals can also be incorporated to improve production/system uptime and field life. The use of artificial lift for oil wells and additional compression for gas wells can be effectively modeled by reasonably calibrated IPM models. Without proper calibration, these models can yield results that lead to inadequate decisions that have a significant impact on project economics. The use of IPM models as a tool to better allocate field production data has proved to be very reliable and has resulted in better field management. This approach requires both reservoir and surface facility information gathered on a regular basis in order to be reliable and accurate. Reservoir, well and surface models require occasional calibration or updates of inflow type curves. Application of these methods are discussed and presented for some field cases for oil reservoirs some under waterflood and others with active water drive.

AB  - Summary Production enhancement projects are creating changes in business relationships between oil & gas and service companies. The most successful projects are building partnerships. Service companies are being asked to share the risk while supplying services to enhance well performance. Risk sharing creates common project objectives and requires the service company's involvement in initial project planning, job design, and reservoir understanding. Service work compensation is based on well or field performance improvement as a result of the treatment(s). This paper presents an integrated approach to the selection and prioritization of well candidates for production enhancement jobs or treatments. Special emphasis is placed on reservoir understanding using field reviews and/or extensive reservoir description studies to provide the essential information for well candidate selection and the best return on investment. Processes are illustrated and discussion gives the data requirements and techniques used to select and prioritize well candidates. Field examples demonstrate the techniques, critical factors, and appropriate software used by geoscience and field operations teams to maximize benefits from production enhancement projects. Introduction The need for a better business arrangement with service companies has been identified by many operating companies. Partnerships evolved to align interests, utilize the same performance measurements, create an environment for teamwork, ensure use of appropriate technology and add value by increasing the project profitability. The bidding process is being replaced with partnerships due to the realization that superior benefits can be obtained. In the typical 'low bid' scheme, the operator planned the project, designed the job and distributed the job specifications to several suppliers to bid the services and materials. In many cases, the operating company would select the vendor supplying the work based on the lowest price. This type of arrangement gave little incentive to the service company to enhance production. If the job went as designed, i.e., the service company was on time, brought the necessary materials, and performed the job within the specifications, the service company considered the job a success. However, the job may not have achieved the expected production increase for the operating company. Project profitability and continuous quality improvement can be compromised in this scenario. The alliance/partnering business arrangement is an excellent vehicle to achieve continuous improvement and apply 'best practices' techniques.

AB  - SPE Members Abstract An engineering system has been developed for sand production prediction. The system synergistically uses geological reservoir characterization, log analysis, and core rock strength testing to forecast perforation cavity stability. Coupling the system with a reservoir simulator permits the modeling of cavity stability at initial conditions and throughout the life of a well. Three examples are given of applications of the engineering system to sand problems in North Sea reservoirs. Introduction Sand production prediction refers to the forecasting of perforation cavity stability in natural completions (i.e., perforated casing). When anticipated conditions of fluid flow or pressure drawdown lead to predictions of uncontrolled and potentially catastrophic sand production, alternatives to natural completions must be used (e.g., selective perforations, gravel packs). In many cases in mature producing areas, sand production prediction has come to be based on empirical relationships and historical precedent. In newer areas, especially offshore, completion engineers are challenged by the need to forecast sand production without analogous reservoir performance as a guide. The cost of positive sand control measures and deferred revenue from possibly reduced rates of initial hydrocarbon production provide the economic incentive for improved sand production prediction methodologies and optimized completion planning. For completion planning or analysis of sand problems of several North Sea reservoirs, an engineering system was developed to integrate geological description, log analysis, core testing, and reservoir simulation. This paper gives an overview of the generic engineering system that has evolved and of the types of data needed from exploration and development programs to make the best possible predictions of perforation cavity stability for completion planning. THE ENGINEERING SYSTEM Sand Production Causes and Constraints Sand problems can be induced by various causes and the consequences of sand production can affect various aspects of reservoir management. Because of the many factors affecting sand production, a strategy for optimized field operation requires comprehensive judgments integrating geology, rock mechanics, logging, production technology, and reservoir engineering. The engineering system starts by identifying constraints inherent in the reservoir or in production facilities. Constraints will help define an operator g ability to control sand production through reservoir management. Examples of constraints with possible impacts on sand production would include: (a) High bubble point oil. To maintain high recovery from a high bubble point reservoir, the reservoir pressure and the well pressure should not be lowered below the bubble point. (b) Erosional limits. Tubing and valves installed along the flow line may have erosional limits. To prevent excessive erosion, drawdown may have to be limited in such a well. (c) Limited pressure support. Water injection rates may be limited in some reservoirs. P. 151^

AB  - Abstract The scope of the paper is to demonstrate the effectiveness of tubing punch technology for a gas well through rig-less operation to bypass flow restriction due to a stuck plug. The scope shall encompass the technology selection, challenges faces and successful deployment relative to conventional options. In a pursuit to reduce rig time, smart solutions have been explored by the operators for effective production enhancement and reliance on multiple well interventions to save cost. The candidate onshore well in discussion is a high potential well with an average gas production of ~30 MMScf/d and condensate averaging ~4,000 STB/d. The well has been producing consistently since 1997 until 2013 where by the well was killed for maintenance activities. In 2015, an attempt to recommission the well was failed due to a stuck slick line plug. The well was attempted to flow though the equalizing ports in the plug body, however that resulted in a significant reduction of flow rate to ~ 8MMscf/d resulting in a production loss of 22 MMSCFD. Various options were contemplated in an attempt to re-instate the well to its original condition i.e. milling, workover, cutter etc., however the options were discounted considering high cost and rig requirements. Tubing punch technology/Solution was chosen in view of the cost effective rig less activity. The paper shall discuss the details of planning, inflow modelling and operational challenges for the well re-instatement to its original condition without compromising well integrity requirements. The technology implementation demonstrated a direct production gain of +/- 22 MMSCFD and +/-400 BOPD using the low cost intervention Tubing punch technology with net cost 27 K $USD

AB  - Technology Today Series articles are general, descriptiverepresentations that summarize the state of the art in an area of technology bydescribing recent developments for readers who are not specialists in thetopics discussed. Written by individuals recognized as experts in the area,these articles provide key references to more definitive work and presentspecific details only to illustrate the technology. Purpose: to inform thegeneral readership of recent advances in various areas of petroleumengineering. Summary This paper presents applications of an asset-management analysis processthat helps quantify and manage uncertainty to aid strategic decision-makingover the life of a field. The dynamic and iterative nature of the process andtools allows for rapid, quantitative systems analysis of the impact of a widenumber of options with their associated uncertainty. The result is a robustmethod to understand the risks and potential value of the prospectiveenterprise on an ongoing basis through development, operation, and expansionphases. Application of the process over the entire life cycle of an asset isdiscussed and illustrated with two case histories. Introduction The risk-based integrated-production-model (RIPM) analysis process wasdeveloped to help quantify and manage uncertainty during development,infrastructure implementation, and operation of a field project. The processquantifies the impact of subsystem (i.e., reservoir, well, or facility)performance with associated uncertainty on the entire system to facilitatestrategic planning and decision-making. It is based on fundamental principlesof integration, quantification, and validation: integration to evaluate anoption's effect on the entire system; quantification to compare several optionson a consistent, absolute basis; and validation to define uncertainty andstrategic avenues for improvement. Ref. 1 introduced the concepts and tools used in the RIPM process, whichuses dynamically linked (i.e., without user interface) models of thesubsystems, called an integrated production model (IPM), to evaluate systemperformance quickly. Risk caused by uncertainty in assumptions, data, (e.g.,physical parameters, economic data), or the model is also quantified whenappropriate and integrated with the IPM to give an RIPM. The result is aniterative process that quickly evaluates alternative options for design andreacts to new data during implementation or operation phases of a project overthe life of an asset. This paper discusses application of the process over an asset's life cycle,presents process features required at different stages of the life cycle, andillustrates applications of the process with two case histories. Range of Applications As an asset advances through its life, changes can occur in the keytechnical and business drivers, uncertainty magnitude, and nature ofoperations. A flexible analysis process is needed to provide a common frameworkto guide decision-making over the asset life stages without hindering theasset's optimization. In development, where analysis focuses on design andplanning, the process should quantify the system constraints and the systemdrivers for a multitude of options and their associated uncertainties.Otherwise, the design may be based on limited, previous experience, potentiallyresulting in many lost opportunities. In infrastructure implementation, whereanalysis focuses on validation and reducing uncertainty, the process shouldquickly identify both the local and global (system) impact of data collectedand strategic forward direction if change is required. Otherwise, the tendencyis either not to react or to overreact to new data, resulting, respectively, inthe loss of key opportunities to enact change or inefficiency from waste. Inoperation, where analysis focus is on production and optimizing the valueextracted, the process should quantify and validate performance and identifyopportunities and risks. The tendency is to manage field events reactivelyrather than proactively and to extract value through passive inaction ratherthan through active optimization. The RIPM process has the necessary features to provide the common frameworkdescribed.1 It is applicable at different phases of an asset's lifeand can affect a wide range of decisions required during that time (Fig.1 ). Field Development. Evaluate various development scenarios and identify keysystem drivers. Field Evaluation and Expansion. Identify and optimize opportunities forexpansion. Field Operation and Maintenance. Identify uplift opportunities, manageoperations, and set depletion strategy with a proactive, fact-basedapproach. Field Acquisition or Exit. Quickly evaluate opportunities to acquire anddispose of assets. Ideally, the RIPM process should be used to create a living model to managea field during all phases of its life. The process is applied with an IPM toassess the potential value of a new or existing field and to examine designoptions with associated risk for field development. Local and globalperformance predictions, base assumptions, and input data are validated assubsystem designs are implemented and forward strategy is set. Validated modelsare then used to develop, monitor, and update depletion plans. The IPM is usedthroughout the operations phase to optimize daily production throughmaintenance of base decline and identification of uplift opportunities. Plansfor field redevelopment or expansion result as opportunities to optimizeextracted value through capital expenditure are identified. Finally, as valueextraction approaches an economic limit, decisions on when and how to harvestthe value can be assessed.

AB  - Introduction Specifically in the upstream sector of oil and gas industry, sand production is a common associated production problem anywhere around the world. Various phases of sand production related businesses have been growing very fast. Various parties such as universities, chemical and equipment manufacturers, service companies and field operators have been working on the sand production issue intensively. While R&D mostly involves academia and chemical and equipment manufacturers, the service companies and field operators would collaborate in field trials and pilot projects. Continuous feedback from the field operators is very important in order to improve the quality and performance of any specific sand control product. Initially a field operator might not be interested in the sand production related issue if there is no such problem in its field. However, once the sand production is detected then all sort of reactions come alive. The sand production if not managed properly will result in significant impact to the well (and field) life, be it reduced productivity, completion premature failure, erosion to the surface equipment and HSE issues including asset integrity and managing environmental impact. All of these effects will somehow or at the end impacting the operator financially, which could have been avoided if the sand issue be taken care of much earlier especially during the field development stage. As seen or heard many times, cost savings were only realized during the development phase of the field but when it came into the production phase, the sand management cost and impact are much greater than the initial cost savings. This is the risk many field operators have been considering nowadays. ¬† The first right step in managing the possible sand production when developing a new field is having a sufficient knowledge of the characteristics of the formation being developed. With better understanding on the rock properties and applicable lesson learnt, a new operator can safely develop a field without having to worry so much on the potential sand production in its field as the well can be properly designed and completed in such a way that the sand production can be safely handled at any stage of well life cycle. But then different operators may approach the field development differently in view of rising cost. There are various techniques being used in determining the optimum sand control method for each well. ¬† For new wells, the best sand control method/equipment can be applied / installed during the completion stage. And yet, it must be understood that traditional completion methods that allow sand-prone reservoirs to be developed most of the times will also sacrifice some of the production efficiency. Among those common sand control methods and widely adopted by field operators around the world are gravel pack, standalone sand screen and sand conglomeration using chemicals. Besides reduced in production efficiency, these methods also pose as other challenges during the production phase. Well intervention operations including stimulation and zonal abandonment for example, will be ineffective or even impossible due to restriction and hard to reach areas on wells completed with those sand control equipment. On the other hand, the biggest advantage on having the right and optimum sand control method right from the beginning is being able to reduce the sand production detrimental effect which is prolonging the well and equipment life. Balancing the potential sand production risk, the future well intervention access, the rising cost and field life is what the operators have been juggling at the development stage.

AB  - It is irrefutable that subsea operation is one of the most critical operations for Oil & Gas industry. To meet the growing demand of energy in the coming years, upstream oil and gas industry will develop even marginal fields which would tie-back to existing infrastructure and require more complex subsea network. Subsea production monitoring, back allocation and fiscal allocation are an essential part of any field development, as inaccurate tracking of production will negatively impact management and recovery from a reservoir. The need for allocation is due to the fact of unavailable quality measurements of oil, gas, condensate and water produced and injected at all nodes in a subsea distribution system. Contrary to easily monitored downstream onshore operation, subsea offshore operations cannot be easily monitored due to low reliability and high cost of subsea sensors. From industry experience, the currently available physical subsea flow meters, instrumentation and associated measurements are subject to deficiency, inconsistency and failure and results in low accuracy, and reliability. Due to these facts, there is a high demand for an alternative and accurate method of flow metering and condition monitoring for offshore operation and processing. In the past few years the use of Virtual Flow Metering systems as a backup or validation system for MPFMs or Wet Gas Meters has become more common. There are various options available depending on the vendor; statistical analysis of measurements (steady state solution), high fidelity online flow simulation models (dynamic solution) or a mix of both (nodal analysis). While VFM is maturing it has not been fully accepted as a viable alternative to good physical metering. Driving the dynamic model with real time measurements from the plant opens a new world of information for the operator in terms of model estimated data and enables him to take better decisions. This paper will present a case study whereby a virtual flow metering system has fully replaced a multiphase flow meter for flow metering and allocation purposes.

AB  - Badra oilfield started production in 2014. After some time from the beginning of the field operation, several troubles manifested itself. Analysis of tubing performance detected clear indication of gas slippage effect on low rate wells and tubing choking effect on high rate wells. Several issues with well integrity also lead to re-assessment of completion design. During selection of new tubing size and completion equipment, factors like production rate, reservoir depletion, GOR, Flowing buttonhole pressure, wellhead pressure and temperature were taken into account. In addition to that, possible well interventions and expected tubing loads were considered. As a result three groups of wells have been identified - low, high and medium production rates in terms of Badra field with new completion concept for each group. New completion design was selected and implemented on several wells and showed its better performance for new production conditions. Moreover, selected production tubing diameter and completion components has lower cost and allows any well interventions that might be planned on the field. In addition to that, new completion string can last longer due to its higher corrosion allowance.

AB  - ABSTRACTProduction logging is difficult in complex well designs such as horizontal multilateral (ML) wells with jagged level-two exits. The ML exits can obstruct the access of logging tools due to damage around the milled windows. Once inside a low-flow high-water cut reservoir, the challenge becomes measuring an oil inflow profile in stratified flow. The access issue is worse in sub-hydrostatic wells completed with artificial lift. Horizontal gas lifted wells are easily choked by the presence of coiled tubing (CT). Y-Tools can be deployed in electrical submersible pump (ESP) wells to provide bypass tubing for logging strings necessary to log while pumping, although the system has not been successful in low rate wells due to re-circulation across the dynamic seal in the Y-Tool. This recirculation invalidates the log data and overheats the motor. As in gas lift completions, the low rate ESP completions also suffer rate reduction caused by the presence of CT. This paper describes the methods used to overcome these access and production logging challenges in North Oman. A new tool configuration that comprises a vertical array of mini spinners and fluid type sensors was used to detect a 2% oil hold-up in a stratified flow. It has a surface controlled collapsible spinner cage that makes the tool slick to maneuver around obstructions in the well. This has overcome some of the level 2 bypass problems in ML wells. A temporary ESP and Y-tool upper completion has been used to log a 3-leg ML backbone successfully. To fix the recirculation problem, a modified Y-tool plug was designed to reduce the fluid leakage in the dynamic seal. A variable speed drive (VSD) at surface controlled the ESP motor speed, adjusting the pump rate to compensate for the rate reduction caused by the presence of the CT. Wireline conveyed tractors have overcome some of the choking limitations of CT in gas lifted wells. Openhole completions remain a challenge.

AB  - This article, written by Senior Technology Editor Dennis Denney, contains highlights of paper SPE 147506, "Pressure-Transient and Production-Data Analysis of a Horizontal Well in an Unconsolidated Formation in Frade, Brazil," by Yan Pan, SPE, Russ Ewy, SPE, Don Ringe, SPE, Medhat M. Kamal, SPE, Ralph Affinito, SPE, and Oluwole Sotunde, SPE, Chevron, prepared for the 2011 SPE Annual Technical Conference and Exhibition, Denver, 30 October-2 November. The paper has not been peer reviewed. Frade Asset is a medium-heavy-oil field in the northern Campos basin, approximately 75 miles offshore Rio de Janeiro in 3,500-ft water depth. The structure is a low-relief anticline with two main fault blocks consisting of four stacked unconsolidated reservoirs. The field produces from nine horizontal oil wells with three vertical water-injection wells to maintain reservoir pressure. Continuous well monitoring and reservoir characterization are key to cost-efficient development in this deepwater subsea field. Introduction The development strategy for the field includes horizontal production wells and deviated injection wells to maintain reservoir pressure. The asset-management team realized the challenges of this particular field and made the decision to install permanent downhole gauges in every production and injection well drilled, with a reservoir-surveillance plan in place to monitor well and reservoir¬†performance. Active reservoir surveillance enabled engineers to make sound and quick operating decisions, such as shutting in wells, changing chokes, or planning well interventions on the basis of dynamic data collected continuously at wells. It also provided real-time information for improved reservoir characterization, model forecasts, and optimized development plans. Because data stream in continuously, the cycle from data collection to updating reservoir models to forecasting field performance to optimizing development could be shortened. Example Well: Producer 2 Well Producer 2 is in the upthrown fault block, as shown in Fig. 1, and had an original reservoir pressure of 3,079 psia and a reservoir temperature of 110¬∞F. The net pay thickness is approximately 42 m, and the horizontal well was drilled 30 m above the sealing bottom of the reservoir. The well trajectory was parallel to the fault to the southwest and to the axial fairway edge to the northeast. The well was completed with an openhole gravel pack, and the total completion length was 507 m. The permanent downhole gauge was installed above the top of the gravel-pack completion.

AB  - The benefits of a multi-objective optimization approach embedding an accurate exergy model of a hydrocarbon production system are shown on a real oil and gas facility. The innovative tool developed is based on a biogenetical differential evolution algorithm, which exploits a self-adaptive iterative procedure to maximize the value of the Asset. The optimization integrates the production system considering the trade-off between hydrocarbon production, energy consumption and efficiency. The Asset value optimization is one of the most complex and multi-disciplinary task in the oil and gas industry, due to the high number of objectives and their synergy. An integrated physical model of wells, gathering network and process plant is built and, then, used for exergy efficiency and gas production optimization. Conflicts and interactions among process variables and operational constraints are treated and solved holistically by the tailored evolutionary algorithm. This has also been integrated with a quick and efficient exergetic and thermoeconomic analysis in order to grant the achievement of the maximum asset value. The multi-objective optimization provides a trade-off between the optimal values of exergy efficiency and gas production that would have been obtained independently with single-objective optimizations. In fact, the exergy efficiency optimization is driven towards a configuration having lower irreversibilities: by apportioning the entire system exergy into the exergy destroyed by each piece of equipment and by calculating its local efficiency, the most contributing to irreversibility generation is identified. Moreover, the exergy analysis is complemented with an exergetic and a thermoeconomic cost analysis: the exergy analysis, apart from describing the quality of any thermodynamic process, does not give any information about the costs of each system stream, which can be even more interesting and of practical application. Indeed, the exergy analysis is proven to be an accurate way of assessing which equipment is performing worse. Therefore, it leads to preventive corrective actions to ensure good thermodynamic performance of the system and supports the decision process in the choice of maintenance operations. The thermoeconomic analysis, based on the theory of exergetic costs, confirms the improved management of the process plant and its efficiency enhancement, without neglecting the main target of the oil and gas industries that is production maximization. The benefits of a novel multi-objective biogenetical approach to solve and optimize a hydrocarbon production system in terms of exergy efficiency and gas production are shown, with respect not only to other methodologies of literature but also in terms of exergetic and thermoeconomic costs of the solutions provided, allowing to achieve the highest value of the operated asset.

AB  - ABSTRACTThe North East Frigg (NEF) gas reservoir is a small satellite of the giant Frigg gas field located in the North Sea in 100 meters of water. NEF gas reserves are to be developed using a subsea production system, this being the first major underwater gas production project ever attempted in the North Sea. The purpose of this paper is to describe the NEF subsea development concept, to explain the ration for its selection and to mention possible applications of this system in the development of other marginal fields.The NEF subsea production facilities comprises of four major components: - a subsea template which houses and protects six wells and a manifold- a 16" gas line which links the manifold to the Frigg Field Treatment platform (TCP2) - a Field Control Station (FCS) whose main function is to control the subsea equipment- treatment, metering and boosting modules installed on the TCP2 platform to process the 6 million cubic meters per day of NEF gas. Different development schemes were evaluated during the preliminary selection studies:- conventional fixed steel structure- subsea wells drilled and controlled from a permanent semi submersible platform moored above the wells- subsea wells and manifold remotely controlled from Frigg field- subsea wells remotely controlled from an unmanned articulated column installed close to the well cluster.The last scheme was selected as being the best optimization in terms of:- Operational safety mainly due to separation of critical functions- Reliability of gas production by extensive use of conventional and tested equipment although assembled in a novel configuration- Investment costs- Potential adaptation of the concept to future developments of marginal fieldsTo date, detailed engineering of project components is completed, fabrication and drilling are in progress. The production start-up is scheduled in 1984. INTRODUCTIONRecent shortages and uncertainties in oil/gas supplies and the related price increases have transformed some unprofitable, marginal and/or difficult fields into commercial ones. In this context Elf Aquitaine Norge (EAN) and its Partners initiated the NEF development studies for producing a satellite of the giant Frigg gas field. This opportunity combined with the present necessity to develop economically attractive concept for producing marginal fields in a difficult environment led to an unconventional approach. Preliminary studies began in 1979 with final decision being made mid 1980. Detailed engineering design of the various sub-systems is now completed. Fabrication of NEF components and the drilling of the wells are in progress. Production start up is expected in 1984.

AB  - SummaryDesigning or redesigning production facilities for optimum operation usually results in the generation of maximum profit from an installation. But in older fields, or fields where a short life is expected, design changes may not be a viable option. In such cases, obtaining maximum production within the limits of existing facilities, thereby minimizing new investments, may be an attractive option.This paper discusses application of the latter technique in the Provincia field, Colombia, to optimize oil and gas production within constraints imposed by periodic temporary gas-compression-capacity restrictions and by the configuration of existing oil and gas facilities. The multistep optimization program used at Provincia included improvement of individual well performance, optimization of individual well facilities, fieldwide optimization of surface facilities, and optimization of the field production scheme.IntroductionThe Provincia field is situated in the Middle Magdalena Valley of Colombia about 200 miles [320 km] north of Bogota (see Fig. 1) and is operated by Intl. Petroleum (Colombia) Ltd. (Intercol) under concessions granted by the Colombian government. The field was originally discovered in 1960 and has produced 152 million bbl [24 x 10-6 m3] oil and 553 Bscf [15.6 x 109 std m3] gas during its lifetime. This total represents about 87% of the ultimate recoverable oil in the reservoir. Current production from the field is 17,000 BOPD [2700 m3/d oil] and 85 Mscf/D [2.4 x 106 std m3/d] gas. The current average field GOR is 5,000 scf/bbl [900 std m3/m3]. Main production is from fluvial braided stream sands in the basal section and from point bar and crevasse sand deposits in the upper section situated at depths between 6,000 and 11,000 ft [1830 and 3350 m] subsea. The field produces by dissolved gasdrive, secondary gas cap, and strong gravity drainage. Very little water is produced from the reservoir. Pressure maintenance by gas-injection has been used in parts of the field since 1965.Most of the production facilities at Provincia, including a natural-gasoline plant, were constructed in the early days of the field and were designed for conditions as they existed at that time. For maximum recovery of oil and gas liquids during early natural-flow production, the gathering system was divided into four different separator pressures ranging from 25 to 800 psig [172 to 5516 kPa]. Wells were originally assigned to the various systems on the basis of their capacity to flow at a desired rate against the given separator pressures. In a typical case, a well may begin production by natural flow into the 800-psig [5516-kPa] system at a rate of 1,000 B/D [159 m3/d] or more with a GOR less than 1,000 scf/bbl [180 std m3/m3]. Gradually, as the well is produced and reservoir pressure drawdown occurs, the well is switched to increasingly lower-pressured systems until it no longer flows naturally. At that time, the well is placed on gas lift and produced to a lower-pressure system. As the GOR of the well increases, or if the well is recompleted in a different zone, it may be changed back to natural flow.Provincia Optimization EffortIn 1983, Intercol began a determined effort to increase both the production efficiency and the overall production from the Provincia field. This effort included an expanded study of reservoir performance and active infill drilling, along with a study of all production facilities to determine how they might be optimized. As a result, the optimization of production facilities was undertaken in several steps, each following closely after the other.Improvement of individual well performance had first priority; the optimization of individual well facilities came next. After the first two steps were completed, fieldwide optimization of surface facilities was studied. Finally, a field production scheme to optimize oil and gas production was developed.Improvement of Individual Well PerformanceThe first undertaking in the optimization program at Provincia was an effort to improve individual well performance. This effort included a detailed performance analysis of all natural-flow, rod-pump, and gas-lift wells and the necessary changes at each well to ensure maximum performance. In many instances, it meant that new monitoring and test equipment had to be installed and new procedures instituted to ensure the maintenance of optimum performance once it was achieved. At this time, an extensive training program for field personnel was also undertaken to ensure that performance objectives were understood.Optimization of Individual Well FacilitiesTo improve well performance, it was necessary to modify existing well facilities. Various flow restrictions were found in wellheads and flowlines at certain wells, and these were either removed or modified. Downhole designs were also changed in some gas-lift wells, and several leaking gas-lift valves were replaced. The method used for unloading gas-lift wells was improved; in some cases, higher injection-gas pressure and gas-injection choke heaters were used.Overall, the effort brought the well performance to near maximum without major changes in the production facilities. Table 1 gives the results of some of the efforts involved in the optimization of individual well facilities.Further results of the effort to improve well performance in gas-lift wells are given in Fig, 3, which shows that from 1983 through 1986, the total number of gas-lift installations increased from 30 to 55, while total oil production increased from 1,700 to 8,000 B/D [270 to 1270 m3/d]. During the same period, total injection-gas volume increased from 8 to 13 MMscf/D [227 x 103 to 368 x 103 std m3/d]. This volume actually amounted to a decrease in injection GOR from 4,700 to 1,625 scf/bbl [847 to 293 std m3/m3] over the 3-year period. The reduction in injection GOR is a good indication of improved efficiencies in Provincia gas-lift wells and represents a total reduction in lift-gas requirements of 24.6 x 106 scf/D [697 x 10-3 std m3/d], or 62 %.Fieldwide Optimization of Production FacilitiesDuring the individual well-optimization program, it became apparent that the field facilities were no longer situated to allow maximum performance from the wells. Many of the new wells were being drilled at a great distance from the two existing production stations. At this time, a study was undertaken to determine whether it would be economically attractive to relocate or to add production facilities. This study indicated that. because of the advanced age of the Provincia field, major changes in existing facilities could not be justified. Where required, however, changes in the route and size of individual flowlines were recommended. Also, active programs of converting high-pressure compressors to low-pressure service and installing additional low-pressure compressors were continued. Tables 2 and 3 summarize the results accomplished during the optimization of production facilities.SPEPE

AB  - Summary Projects progress through phases of design, construction, installation, commissioning, initial startup, and operations. This paper addresses issues that arise at initial startup. Initial startup is defined here as the period when reservoir hydrocarbons are produced for the first time. Initial startup of a subsea development is one of the most challenging periods in the operational life of the facility. Many issues complicate this period, including People issues. Many people from many teams are required to execute a startup; roles and responsibilities may be unclear and will change over the course of the startup; persons-onboard (POB) issues limit the number of people who can participate; personnel involved may not be fully trained in the operation of the facility. This will be the first time much or all of the equipment is used in live hydrocarbon service. Design flaws, commissioning omissions, and infant mortalities will reveal themselves. Preserving completion integrity requires low rates and slow bean-ups during initial startup because of high formation skin. Chokes designed for high rates and low pressure drops may not be capable of controlling the well at low rates. Also, topside systems designed for peak rates may not function well at low flow rates. Low flow rates and low initial temperatures result in hydrate risk, which may challenge the flow-assurance strategy. Completion and stimulation fluids returned during the initial well cleanup are corrosive and are difficult to treat. Typically, specialized water-treatment equipment is installed temporarily at topside to treat these fluids. The flowback fluids may also contain solids from the reservoir and from construction debris that may cause problems such as plugging small ports in control valves. Drilling, construction, installation, and commissioning activities [simultaneous operations (SIMOPS)] may still be in progress. The exact state of equipment items may be unclear and may change over the course of the startup. Reservoir engineers will seek to obtain reservoir information through well tests, especially pressure-buildup tests. Other data-collection efforts are important to validate the design and establish benchmarks. Some regulatory requirements apply specifically to the startup period. Special procedures are usually written for the initial startup. These will differ in important ways from the normal operating procedures. There is risk that there may be errors in the startup procedures, that operators may err in implementing the procedures, or that equipment designed for normal operation will not function well at the conditions imposed by the startup. Startup is one of the most hazardous periods in field life. Effective risk management is essential. Careful planning is required to achieve a trouble-free startup. This paper describes the key requirements for generating effective initial-startup plans and procedures.

AB  - AbstractPassive acoustic listening is relatively simple to implement in downhole equipment and has an interesting potential for downhole measurements. During a flow loop test at high temperature and pressure, SINTEF measured the acoustic noise inside a choke valve and developed an empirical model for prediction of flow rates of gas, oil and water. The accuracy is better than 7% FSO. An accuracy of 5% FSO is achieved for sensorfusion of an acoustic sensor with a differential pressure sensor, a watercut sensor and a differential temperature sensor. SINTEF has developed a filterbank HT ASIC for the downhole signal processing of acoustic data.IntroductionTo be able to manage reservoir drainage optimally, the production engineer should have detailed knowledge about the significant downhole physical states. Normally, uncertainty is dominating the picture. Having the potential of eliminating most of the well inflow uncertainty, downhole production allocation sensors (zonal rate and liquids composition) have a special value. With an array of such sensors, and the addition of permanent pressure sensors, the uncertainty problem may reduce to reservoir uncertainties "only". However, there is a trend towards developing more complex reservoirs in more complex formations. The consequences are higher pressure gradients in the reservoir during the drainage process, poorer seismic pictures and more uncertainties in general.A combination of topside and downhole monitoring, together with techniques such as tracers seem to be the only remedy for improving the knowledge needed for optimizing the processes. Thus, monitoring seems necessary not only for calculating mass flow and controlling well hydraulics, but also for reservoir and formation characterization purposes.Status for reservoir drainage with downhole permanent monitoring and control systems (1) is that the benefit of permanent monitoring has been demonstrated through the last ten years (2,3,4,5,6).Sensorfusion is also a vital key towards a complete picture of the drainage process in wells. The harsh environment in oil wells limits the available sensors and their resolution. Restriction to the data communication transfer rate is also a problem. This problem is avoided by proper instrumentation of oilfields. The data from downhole permanent sensors must be used as complementary data sets to extract more information about physical states in the oil well. One objective of the study of acoustic listening in oil wells is to combine acoustic noise with measurements from other sensors like differential pressure, watercut and differential temperature, all of them actual for downhole performance. A proper sensorfusion model should feature redundancy for lack of some sensor data, increased resolution and better accuracy of downhole measurements.The acoustic signal should be correlated to different flow regimes where the physical states are as close as possible to actual states in a downhole choke valve. A flow loop installation is used to calibrate the estimation model for three phase flow rates. High pressure, high temperature and actual oil, water and gas from the specific reservoir, are important factors for reproducing downhole acoustic spectra accurately in the lab.Passive acoustic listening in oilfieldsAcoustic sensorAn acoustic sensor is robust, has a simple design, is relatively easy to implement in downhole equipment and has an interesting potential for downhole measurements.

AB  - Abstract The gas lift, by limited capacity of 25 MMSCF/D, was introduced for Khafji field in 1988 which could successfully sustain target rate until mid of 2004. Even though, additional artificial lift energy was planned as long term solution due to the increase of field water cut and depletion of reservoirs, production optimization was found to be the best way to sustain field target until commissioning of these new facilities. For that purpose, general optimization and gas lift allocation models have been built and applied for Khafji field as presented by Ghoniem et al1. Although, production system modeling is a powerful technology to optimize and understand the whole production system, the individual well modeling hence dynamic nodal analysis and the reliable field measurements are still highly contributed to increasing oil rate. Consequently, the present work is a further and more comprehensive optimization study for Khafji crude production by: Updating the previously built optimization models Screening for new effective wells for gas lift operation Review the design of existing gas lift installations Optimizing the choke size for many natural flow wells Practical adaptation to the dynamic process of production optimization. As a result, several high productivity wells were selected and put recently on gas lift operations, also gas lift re-design was made for many wells. Furthermore, wellhead choke size was optimized for many natural flow wells. As a result, a significant marginal oil gain was obtained and confirmed by field measurements. Also, a lot of recommendations for gas lift operations and for mature oil fields were concluded. Introduction Production optimization has been considered as a dull activity in some quarters and has not had the same attention which paid to reservoir simulation which still has some limitations in daily field prediction and optimization. Besides, the impact of surface flow line network is always being considered as fixed input into reservoir simulator, this practice might lead to inaccurate prediction results which are often taken as a design basis for future field development planning. Therefore, the future technology challenge is either to extent reservoir model to include wells actually up to wellhead then through flow lines until the delivery point, or to link the optimization model with reservoir model as one unit in order to recognize for future uncertainties. However, the continuous updating for production optimization model can overcome these limitations. Nevertheless, the gain in oil production has to be large enough to warrant the resources necessary for updating the optimization models, because the management has an interest in seeing an increase in oil rate and that production system is operated as efficiently as possible in Khafji field. Khafji field lies in the Arabian Gulf, 40 km east of Al-Khafji city, Saudi Arabia (Fig. 1). The field is composed of several reservoirs for sweet crude. The most prolific ones are 1st and 2nd Bahrain sand. Where, a strong and an active aquifer provides pressure support and water drive to 2nd Bahrain and to a lesser extent to 1st Bahrain. In addition, four other oil reservoirs are currently active namely Ahmadi limestone, B-limestone, Wara sand and Zubair sand which are commonly referred to as minor reservoirs. In Khafji field, there are approximately a hundred wells which are already completed with gas lift injection system. But only 44 wells can be operated by the limited capacity of lift gas. Even though, many remaining gas lift wells are still producing naturally with lower rate, some others are currently being shut in. Thus, the most effective wells for gas lift operation were defined by performing lot of screening runs using gas lift allocation models.

AB  - Abstract An Integrated Production Modelling process is presented that is used to automate CSG (Coal Seam Gas) production forecasts from reservoir to sales. This involved incorporating type curves representing future reservoir performance into a hydraulic model of the surface network. One of the key challenges was to convert time-dependent decline curve forecasts into time and pressure-dependent reservoir-well models suitable for Integrated Production Modelling process. Results are compared to other methods with reduced simulation time, improved accuracy and scenario analysis. This innovative approach used a combination of techniques to incorporate type curve based reservoir models into two large integrated production models. The first model consisted of 250 wells and a single compressor station and the second model consisted of 500 wells and multiple compressor stations. Different techniques were applied for wells that were pre or post dewatering and incorporated into a surface network modelling tool. This allowed production forecasts to be generated automatically for the single compressor station model and semi-automated for the multiple compressor station model whereby the system was solved to meet demand or to maximise production taking into account constraints. Type curve data was converted to a ‚Äòtight gas‚Äô reservoir model which showed a good match for wells post dewatering but not for wells that were still inclining. A combination of proprietary scripting in a network simulation program and macro code in Excel were used to handle system constraints optimisation. The time taken to run each scenario reduced significantly as the restriction moved from a human to the amount of computing power. Accuracy and repeatability of results also improved due to models being setup and solved in a consistent manner, thereby removing discrepancies associated with manually driven models. This allowed for more scenarios to be modelled in the time allocated to the production forecasting processes allowing for improved analysis and decision making. Previously type curved based reservoir models could not be solved by a surface network modelling tool automatically without human intervention. This was not possible due to the size and complexity of the surface network and because of the lack of time and pressure-dependent reservoir-well models suitable for Integrated Production Modelling process. The process outlined in this paper overcame this challenge.

AB  - The paper presents the flow assurance challenges and the mitigation steps taken in the deep, high pressure & high temperature North Kuwait Jurassic (NKJ) Fields. Flow assurance is extremely diverse subject linked to different engineering disciplines. Understanding the reservoir fluid behavior, rock minerals, completion & pipeline metallurgy and operating envelope is critical to understand and overcome the flow assurance challenges. Pipeline Hydrate Formation is the biggest operational challenge, which frequently disrupts the production of some of the high producing gas wells during the winter months. Different chemicals and combinations of such have been attempted to mitigate the hydrate problem, still optimization of the chemical injection process is ongoing. Other problems of solid, scale or salt blockage in the tubing, surface chokes and pipelines have occurred and steps were taken to clear the obstructions. The NKJ fluids are highly corrosive and a corrosion inhibitor is injected at the wellhead to protect the surface pipelines. Addressing all these challenges require thorough knowledge of the specialized subjects and advance modeling to improve the field operational philosophy. In the NKJ fields, the pipeline connecting the well to the processing facility (5 ‚Äì 30 Km long) are neither buried nor insulated. During the winter months (during night & early morning), the well fluid cools down below the hydrate formation temperature in the flowline causing hydrate crystallization and even plugging of the pipeline. Out of the 30 producing wells in the NKJ fields, half of the wells produce water and have hydrate tendency. The produced water salinity varies from well to well and range from fresh water to highly saline water with salinity as high as 330 kppm. This makes the system highly complex and manifest need for a robust solution. The paper walks through the traditional methods of hydrate mitigation done in the NKJ fields and the way in which transient model was initially built and continuously improved with more data. Currently methanol is used as the hydrate inhibitor and an anti-agglomerate (AA) is under trial. The methanol concentration is governed mostly by experience and on a reactive mode. An offline transient model advisor was built to understand the hydrate mechanism and optimize the methanol injection The advisor is still under trial, once simulation matches with the field conditions, then it will be online and linked to the existing KwIDF (Kuwait Integrated Digital Fields) technology program. Under KwIDF, Chemical Management workflow will be designed to optimize methanol injection to minimize the well downtime and reduce the OPEX cost. The transient advisor also can predict the surge at the facility inlet which can assist in balancing the production in and out of the facility.

AB  - AbstractThe paper focuses on the experiences with the subsea production system of the Girassol development project as seen from the supplier's perspective. FMC Kongsberg Subsea was responsible for the subsea production system under an EPC (engineering, procurement and construction) contract awarded by TotalFinaElf E&P Angola.The paper highlights the following main areas: Technical solutions Product qualifications and system testing Familiarisation of personnel to equipment and procedures Establishment and operation of service support base in Angola Schedule and logisticsSummaryThe design and construction of the Girassol deepwater subsea system has been based on a meticulous dedication to technical details and associated qualification of new solutions.The limited number of technical problems encountered to date with the subsea equipment during drilling and completion, marine installation and initial start-up of the field have indicated that the approach chosen was the correct one. For the design and qualification of the Girassol equipment, it became evident that existing industry standards did not include the sufficient verification requirements to ensure that individual components and equipment would cope with operational requirements.The importance of involving operational personnel in the design and testing of equipment as early as possible in the schedule has been demonstrated.It should be noted that the remote location of the field suggests that the equipment should be thoroughly tested prior to shipment, as local repairs and retesting would be time consuming, difficult and expensive. Hence, attention to scheduling and logistics is deemed to be as important as technical aspects.FMC Kongsberg Subsea's policy is to develop close relations with international customers by the establishment of base facilities to serve local industrial development. The base in Luanda is a significant achievement, employing more than 45 Angolan nationals and assisting in the development of a technology transfer process to the national industrial network.IntroductionFMC Kongsberg Subsea (FKS) was awarded the EPC contract for the Girassol subsea production system (SPS) in July 1998 by operator TotalFinaElf E&P Angola. The contract was won in fierce competition with all major competitors after an extensive design competition to propose a technically sound and cost-effective solution in line with the overall technical specifications. To use the words of the operator and client at the time of contract award;"Girassol represents one of the most ambitious field developments underway and is a frontier technology project with a high degree of technological innovation in a new geological area with aggressive cost and schedule targets. It represents a first step and the industrial prototype of a series of major developments on the Block 17 offshore Angola"In hindsight, there is no doubt that this statement was true and maybe should even have been extended to embrace even larger challenges. This paper focus on the experiences and lessons learned from the Girassol subsea development project seen from the supplier perspective.

AB  - As energy demand continues to grow, it is amazing that more than half of world oil production comes from fields as old as 30 years. The Cambay offshore fields off the coast of Gujarat, India started producing gas in 2002 and oil 2005. The production of Oil was possible through geophysical studies that led to incremental recoverable volumes. The oil wells with cased hole perforated completions however have a sanding problem after a few years of production leading to rapid oil production decline in the field as well as associated sand production issues. This paper presents the result from implementing the simultaneous gravel packing and hydraulic fracturing of a well commonly known as ‚ÄúFracPacks‚Äù in the industry on a sanding well in the field and a comparison to 2 other wells with different completion techniques. The paper outlines the challenges faced with data collection, the design methodology, an overview of operations and execution. The outcome of the FracPack treatment was a textbook tip screen out placement leading to a 76% increase in oil production with zero water cut and sand. The results demonstrate the benefits of contacting the reservoir beyond the critical matrix even in a 2.4 Darcy formation and highlights that FracPacks can be less sensitive to the procedures used for wellbore preparations.. The lessons learned from the Cambay experience add to the growing number of case histories which show that FracPacks are effective techniques for sand management in high permeability formations. FrackPack performance is compared to other techniques such as standalone screens and gravel packs, both in terms of production as well as production longevity. This study will highlight the importance of selecting the completion technique based on the reservoir challenges and the importance of considering constraints such as nearby water, logistics and other operational concerns.

AB  - Abstract Analyzing well performance and making decisions based on it is a core part of a reservoir and production engineer‚Äôs role. This paper, an extension of the universal type curve approach, will assist technical professionals in understanding the performance of their wells and help them make quick and reliable decisions by employing a novel set of type curves for evaluating well performance. The new set of diagnostic type curves is an amalgamation of multiple techniques, but mainly employs the modified Power-Law-Exponential (PLE) equation and the modified Arps equation. The two sets of diagnostic type curves presented in this paper were shown to be useful in evaluating and predicting performance for unconventional horizontal wells, especially those with frac hits, excessive interference, and downhole issues. The results also provide guidance for decline parameters to use in performance predictions. Introduction With the advent of unconventional reservoirs, many conventional forecasting techniques needed to be modified to account for different flow regimes and other changing well properties. Joshi & Lee (2013) compared various decline techniques and the conclusion was that none of the decline curve models could predict long-term performance accurately with less than 18 months of monthly data. Recently, Muralidharan & Joshi (2018) simplified the type curve process by employing a universal type curve (UTC) approach that removes biases when conducting decline curve analysis while narrowing uncertainty in the EUR. In brief, the UTC approach was validated using a robust workflow, starting with petrophysical analysis, progressing to flowing material balance and rate transient analysis, followed by history matching using a numerical simulator. In total, 147 wells with a minimum of two years of production and pressure history was used for an EUR analysis. The result of the UTC approach was a rule of thumb: On average, the technical EURs are about 3 times the 1-year cumulative production, with an expected range of 2.5 to3.5.

AB  - Abstract Passive Inflow Control Devices (PICD) are a common completion method for horizontal wells. A PICD completion can not only equalize the fluid influx along the length of the horizontal well but also can delay breakthrough of unwanted fluids and solve the challenges associated with uneven reservoir heterogeneities. Saudi Aramco is now the world leader in the use of PICD technology. Since the first installation of PICD in 2002, Saudi Aramco utilized various types of PICD for their sandstone and carbonate oil fields. Among these fields, one particular carbonate field was selected to study the performance of PICD completion and assess its effectiveness over barefoot completion. Production logs from 22 post-installation horizontal wells with PICD from the subject were analyzed. A near-wellbore simulator was used to match the actual fluid influx in PICD completion obtained from production logs. The matched model was used to simulate the flux profile for the openhole case and well performance was compared with PICD case. As part of the evaluation, production history of the PICD installed wells was also studied. Time-to-water breakthrough and increase in water-cut trends for PICD-installed wells were investigated to find how PICD design can improve fluid flux along the horizontal well and delay unwanted fluid. This exsercise helped identify optimization design guidelines with regards to number of compartments, PICDs per compartment and the process of dealing with uncertain changing well conditions in naturally fractured carbonate field. Dynamic modeling was also performed to evaluate the suggested PICD design recommendations with respect cumulative oil production and water breakthrough deferment. This paper describes the detailed evaluation methodology, analysis results for the selected field and subsequent recommendations for design practice to maximize the value of PICD.

AB  - Abstract The objective of the research presented in this paper is to investigate the effectiveness of "Genetic Algorithm" technique in optimising the performance of hydrocarbon producing wells. The performance of a production well is a function of several variables. Examples of these variables are tubing size, choke size, and separator pressures. Changing any of the variables will alter the performance of the well. The advantages of nonlinear optimization methods are many. Using nonlinear optimization techniques, there is no limit to the number of decision variables that can be optimized simultaneously. Through this paper, a new method for analysis of an oil and gas condensate production system is presented. This method is a new stochastic method which enables us to analyze a system of mathematical equations containing a great number of decision variables and determine the optimum values of them, that should give the most economic result. The presented method is referred to as "Genetic Algorithm" (GA). Here a mathematical model approach is initially applied for the well and surface facilities and then the result is analyzed and further optimized to enhance profitability. The production facilities considered in this paper consist of tubing, choke, and separators. The method applied is able to consider dual sized tubing (combination of tubing and casing). Furthermore, it is able to determine the optimum number of separators. The developed code in MATLAB environment, based on GA, is able to obtain the most optimum size(s) for the tubing (single size or dual sized tubing), the depth at which the tubing size should vary (in case dual sized tubing is selected), choke size, number of separators, and separator pressures. The optimisation of these parameters should result in improved hydrocarbon liquid production. Finally, this method and the developed code have been applied to the production system of a real oil field and the obtained results have been compared to those of Prosper simulator. The results show that GA is a powerful tool to analyze the production system of hydrocarbon fields. Introduction Petroleum engineers face a wide variety of parameter estimation and optimization problems. The objective in these problems is to determine the optimum values of controllable variables (decision variables) to obtain maximum economical profit or maximum fractional liquid recovery.

AB  - A 20% increase in production rate was achieved through a production optimization program in the Shenzi field in the deepwater Gulf of Mexico at little to no cost. The Shenzi Field lies approximately 120 miles from the Louisiana coast in the Gulf of Mexico. It was discovered in 2002 and first oil was produced in 2009 from the Shenzi TLP. In 2012, the production engineering, surface engineering and operations teams initiated a production optimization program to maximize the production from existing well stock. Production optimization was achieved through a number of key activities including: advances in asphaltene management, gas lift and well configuration optimization, minimum bottom hole pressure reduction and deferral reduction. Using integrated production modelling as the primary evaluation tool, each opportunity was evaluated technically and economically. Asphaltene management was improved through real time detection of asphaltene deposition, which allowed adjustment on inhibitor rates to reduce cost and timely treatments. Automatic well configuration modelling allowed for optimized production scenarios and gaslift injection rates. Validating completion limits ensured drawdown on wells were maximized. Development of more efficient well test programs ensured accurate well data while reducing deferrals. Field production was increased by 20% by executing these activities for minimal additional cost. This paper summarizes a novel use of integrated production modelling techniques in real time in order to evaluate and implement key optimization activities. A variety of data will be presented including the identification of opportunities using modelling outcomes, optimization process and production improvement realized.

AB  - Abstract Description Oil industries with higher potential reservoirs are having restrictions to maximize the oil production when the gas handling capacities are limited with considerations to environment. There can be other limitations such as water handling capacity and well-head sensitivity limitations. To overcome these limitations this paper provides a comprehensive method, which was developed with combination of mathematical tools like curve fitting techniques to build well model from production test results and linear/ nonlinear programming for optimizing the well models. Application This method summarized can be applied to optimize/ maximize oil production in matured fields, fields with limitation on gas handling and high GOR limitations. Principle used in this paper can be used in fields with water handling limitation also. This will help reducing impact on environment as well. Results and Conclusions Results for maximum oil which can be produced with the gas plant design conditions, limitations are provided in this paper and set of well choke opening for the optimum production are generated by program for different cases. Previous works used the approach to optimize mainly gas lift wells, this paper proposes for oil production optimization, moreover previous works created well performance curves on the basis of oil production or estimations, but this work is based on choke opening and well test results of encoded wells. ¬† Technical Contributions A novel method of combining well test data to interpolate oil, gas, water production equation (Well performance curves) in terms of well choke opening (which is decision variable) is used. This paper provides optimum oil produced from field, Maximum oil which can be produced from field with different Gas limitations, and field maximum oil production capacity. All the above results are generated without using any specialized software.
